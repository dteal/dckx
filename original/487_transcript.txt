n\nSex positions are positions that two people can have sexual intercourse in. Many of them are named, although only one generally accepted position is named after a number: the 69.\nCueball and Megan try to approximate the shapes of the numbers, that they are given by the narrator, as sex positions. They start with the classic 69, then represent the number 99 as "spooning" while standing and the number 71 as "doggy-style" sex over a table. They are then given ever more difficult numbers to attempt, first 34 (maybe referencing rule 34 of the internet) - Cueball exclaims Uh as he has no idea how to make a 3 although Megan does try (in vain) to form a 4. Then they are completely baffled by \xe2\x88\x9a8, and just stand there while the narrator asks Guys? - as in give it a try. And finally Megan gives up and leaves at the suggestion ln(2\xcf\x80) to the frustration of the narrator who exclaims Aww, c\'mon. \nThe narrator is so frustrated, as we are told in the title text, because he did not even get to ask them to do a continued fraction (which likely would have involved many other people) as the ultimate challenge.\n\n
