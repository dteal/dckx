n\nThis comic is about alcohol and programming ability. Programmers sometimes have a reputation for drinking habits, and programmer gatherings (such as hackfests) tend to offer copious amounts of alcohol. More generally, intoxicated programmers can get the impression that, by being a little disconnected from physical reality, they become more efficient at their programming. The comic is a take on this belief, with two references:\n\nIn atomic physics, "Balmer peaks" (with one \'L\') are peaks in the emission spectrum of hydrogen (named after the 19th century scientist Johann Balmer).\nSteve Ballmer (with two \'L\') is a key figure of Microsoft and its CEO from 2000 to 2014; he is known for energetic outbursts and outlandish behavior in public (with some videos gone viral), which can give the impression that he is constantly intoxicated.\n\nThe curve in the comic suggests that, while generally decreasing with alcohol intoxication, at just the right level the skill of a programmer gets terrific indeed. Randall named the peak after Steve Ballmer, as if discovered by him; this references the analogously named Balmer peaks (with one \'L\'), and the idea that Steve Ballmer makes for an easy association of programming and alcohol. The peak of the curve occurs at a BAC of 0.1337%, which is a reference to leet. (See this interview with Randall).\nThe end of the comic turns the whole idea into a sideways jab at Windows ME, a version of Microsoft Windows often criticized for being buggy, slow and unstable: it suggests that ME was developed by programmers completely drunk, because their managers wanted to exploit this "Ballmer peak", but did so without any precaution. That idea fit well the result of a buggy and unstable product.\nOn the contrary, the title text claims that Apple uses this effect with careful calibration, by delivering precise quantities of alcohol (schnapps) to its programmers via intravenous therapy (IV).\nAn actual research reported on December 2014 showed that the situation described in this paper is not far from reality. The peak in reality is 0.075 and in the comic it is 0.13.[1]\n\n
