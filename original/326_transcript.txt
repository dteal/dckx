n\n"Affect" and "effect" can each both be noun and verb, share the sense of influence, and are often confused. (See the usage note under "Affect".)\nIn careful speech both words (as verbs) are similar but not identical. "Affect" is /\xc9\x99\xcb\x88f\xc9\x9bkt/ (or uh-fekt) and "effect" is /\xc9\xaa\xcb\x88f\xc9\x9bkt/ (or ih-fekt). However, for some people these words are homophones \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s also explained here: homophones affect vs effect.\n"Effect" is usually a noun, meaning a result, and "affect" usually a verb, meaning to act upon. "Effect" as a verb has the slightly different meaning to bring about. Cueball says that the foreign policy causes the situation, not, as the "grammar nazi" thinks, that it changes the situation.\nThe title of the comic translates to cause or bring about a result, which is just what Cueball does! It can also be seen as a play on words, being similar to the phrase "cause and effect."\nThe title text refers to a practice common among fighter pilots in a war zone. Fighter pilots that score a "kill" on an opposing aircraft will have a silhouette of the downed plane painted on the side of their plane as a way of keeping track of kills. In this sense, Cueball "shot down," figuratively speaking, an online (grammar) nazi, and would mark it by painting a silhouette on the side of his computer.\nSee also 1429: Data.\n\n
