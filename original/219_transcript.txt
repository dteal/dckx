n\nIn an apparent continuation of comic 150: Grownups, Megan is showing off a blanket fort to her friend Ponytail. Ponytail answers that Megan\'s childishness stems from a fear of growing up. \nMegan responds that she\'s fine with growing up. She sees her behavior as a mature realization that some of the things she enjoyed as a child are still enjoyable. When pressed for evidence that she has in any way become an "adult", it is revealed that her boyfriend is inside the blanket fort. He has not spoken because he fears to be found by them when "not exactly dressed," thus implying "adult" activities had been going on in the fort.\nThe title text provides another example of this: They built a fort in the woods, another type of fort that a kid would love to have, but then used it to hide a body. This implies that they killed someone, which is not usually something associated with children. A hooker is also more formally known as a prostitute which is also not usually something associated with children.\n\n
