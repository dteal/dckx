n\nDuring a casual talk with Megan, Ponytail suddenly interrupts her normal speech stating that she is for some reason only capable of controlling her own voice once every six years. Apparently only for a very brief time since she immediately returns to the casual talk, continuing her previous sentence mid-word before being able to tell Megan how she could help her. Upon Megan\'s confused request, she denies knowledge of the occurrence, although in a somewhat suspicious way, using possibly fake laughter.\nIt could be this was just a prank by Ponytail, to tease Megan, but given her fake laughter reply to Megan\'s inquiry and the continuing comment in the title text it seems most likely that Ponytail is indeed possessed by some sort of entity that prevents her from expressing her own thoughts, except for a very short time every six years. Of course this may just be her way of continuing with the prank; see a previous case of such a prank below.\nIn case it is not a prank it would thus appears that Ponytail\'s usual "self" is indeed this possessing entity. Whether this entity is actually aware that the "real" Ponytail did speak, or if it actually does not know that it was interrupted (since it continued mid-word) is not clear from the last response to Megan.\nThe title text suggests that Ponytail is possessed by some sort of inhuman entity, most likely an alien or AI, unfamiliar with movies and eating.
