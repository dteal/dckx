n\nSome online stores allow you to enter a coupon code for a discount on one of their products. Coupon codes may be a single, simple word or a complex sequence of characters. In this comic, Cueball enters a long and detailed blackmail message in the normally short coupon code form, hoping that blackmail could serve the way a coupon code would.  This works so well that Cueball is discounted the full price of the product he\'s buying. The humor comes from the fact that Cueball\'s intimidation works as if the online seller was an actual person, and not a computer.  \nThe title text references 325: A-Minus-Minus; it has become a running gag that bobcats are occasionally sent by mail by Black Hat in various comics.\n\n
