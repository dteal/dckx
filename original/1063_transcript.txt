n\nBlack Hat creates a one-use time machine. Cueball selects the most common suggestion for a time machine usage: killing Adolf Hitler. Black Hat finally relents and goes to kill Hitler. He returns, commenting that he found Hitler in a very noisy bunker in the year 1945. Cueball realizes to his dismay that Black Hat wasted his one and only opportunity by killing Hitler after his regime was already collapsing and Soviet troops were closing in on him, thus leaving the overall course of history unaltered from the normal timeline in which Hitler committed suicide to avoid capture. \nThis is typical Black Hat behavior, going out of his way just to troll people like Cueball, in this case deliberately not changing any history or avoiding any of the atrocities carried out by Nazi Germany. Though that might be for the best, since killing Hitler early might cause more problems than it would solve.\nIncidentally, there are conspiracy theories that Hitler was shot by someone other than himself. Also, if Novikov self-consistency principle is true, Hitler\'s suicide was interrupted by Black Hat in the first place, and Black Hat was merely going back in time to do the thing he already did.\n"BRB" is an abbreviation that stands for "be right back".\nThe title text also refers to the time travel theme from the Superman movie in which Jor-El states: "It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history".\n\n
