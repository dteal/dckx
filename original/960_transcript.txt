n\n  The FedEx Express logo, for comparison\nThis comic is about the FedEx logo and how there is a subliminal/hidden arrow in the logo; specifically, in the whitespace between the "E" and the "x". When Cueball looks at the logo, he instead sees a wild scene including Guy Fawkes, Willie Mays and an assault vehicle. The implication being in the title text that he is affected by hallucinogenic wild mushrooms.\nGuy Fawkes was a British revolutionary who tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605. His likeness is nowadays used as a symbol of protest, most famously in the graphic novel and movie "V For Vendetta" and by Anonymous and the Occupy movement.\nWillie Mays was an American baseball player for the San Francisco Giants who made a famous over-the-shoulder catch in the World Series. Some consider it to be the best defensive play of all time in baseball.\nThe title text is also a play on the Internet idiom "once you see it, you can\'t unsee it".\n\n
