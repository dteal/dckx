n\nMegan and Cueball are taking photos of their own anatomy for inclusion in relevant Wikipedia articles. It is revealed that instead of taking these photos at home or in a professional studio, they are shooting at a TGI Friday\'s restaurant.\nTGI Friday\'s is an American multinational restaurant chain known for its casual family-friendly atmosphere, upbeat service, and fried appetizers. Megan\'s and Cueball\'s behaviour is of course highly inappropriate, due to the sanitation issues relating to sitting or laying naked on the tables, as well as public decency issues; nudity is illegal in most public places, and this is compounded by the fact that there are usually children in TGI Friday\'s. It is likely that the erection plate, is supposed to refer to a fear erection, created as a result of greater blood pumping from adrenaline\nThe message implicit in the comic (and stated outright in the title text) is that careful cropping can produce useful, apparently professional reference images, even if the source photograph was not taken in a professional manner, or was pornographic in nature.\n\n
