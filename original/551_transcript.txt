n\nCueball notices that if you draw a lot on an Etch-a-Sketch, the aluminum powder in it can be cleared from enough of the screen to allow a view of the interior (as seen here).\nCueball then proceeds to clear a window into the device, which shows him that there\'s a girl, Megan, inside whose job is to act as the stylus for the Etch-a-Sketch. She suggest that they be friends, and little hearts pop up.\nAs the dream clears, it then becomes clear that this is just a fantasy, and Cueball sighs at the rather more mundane reality that the lines get drawn by a stylus moving on a simple arrangement of rods. The comic ends with Cueball shaking the Etch-a-Sketch, which resets it and will re-conceal the mechanism.\nThe title text notes that sometimes the mysteries surrounding us turn out to be much more boring than we dream they are.\n\n
