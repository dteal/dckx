n\nA period, also called a menstrual cycle, is a process marked by (among other things) a few days of abdominal cramps occurring roughly once a month for women in the reproductive age.\n"Period" (T) is also the term in mathematics for a measure of the rate at which something happens. It measures the length of time between occurrences. For example, a full moon happens about once every 29.5 days, so its period is 29.5 days. By taking the inverse of this, we can get a different measurement, its frequency (f) - the number of times an event happens within a given length of time. This is usually measured in hertz (pronounced the same as "hurts"), which is the number of times something happens in a second. Hertz is abbreviated as Hz, and since f = 1/T, with T measured in seconds (s), it follows that 1 Hz = 1 s-1.\nThe woman has her period every 28 days (her period has a period of 28 days, if you will). Since we can calculate the frequency based on the period, we can, indeed, calculate her "uterus-hertz" but she already knew that her "uterus hurts". Yes, this has all been a setup to a terrible pun to make your head hertz. And if she had not been in such terrible pains that she cannot even get up, she would have smacked Cueball for it. This makes it even more hertzfull by Cueball, to make fun of his girlfriend in such a state.\nThe woman off screen is probably Megan given that she is most often depicted as Cueball\'s girlfriend, and the fact that he is in her home with her on the couch is a good indicator that they are intimate. (This is not enough to include this comic as one with Megan).\nThe title text gives the other answer that can be calculated from Cueballs musings, the actual frequency of the womans  period which have a period T = 28 days. 413 nanohertz is the correct frequency as shown here by Google Calculator. \nIt can also easily be shown here: \n\nf = 1/28 days = 1/(28 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minutes) \n= 1/(2,419,200s) = 4,1336*10-7 s-1\n= 413*10-9 Hz = 413 nHz.\n\n\n
