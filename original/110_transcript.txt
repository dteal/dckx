n\n"Frankly, my dear, I don\'t give a damn", is the signature catchphrase from the 1939 movie Gone With The Wind (film), which starred Clark Gable (mentioned in the comic title) and Vivien Leigh. The phrase is spoken by Gable\'s character Rhett Butler as his last line in answer to Leigh as Scarlett O\'Hara\'s question "Where shall I go? What shall I do?". The response indicates that Butler is no longer interested in O\'Hara. This disinterest, and the mention of the word "damn", which was considered profanity at the time of releasing the film, led to the line being voted the #1 movie line of all time in 1995\'s American Film Institute ranking.\nRandall suggests that the line as written was not supposed to contain profanity, but the actor, Gable, had Tourette\'s Syndrome, which is a neurological condition that is stereotypically characterized by bouts of random uncontrollable cursing.\nThe title text contains a more stereotypical Tourette\'s Syndrome outburst of several profanities shouted in a row mid-sentence.\n\n
