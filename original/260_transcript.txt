n\nThis is one of the most romantic comics in xkcd. \nThe heat from a lightning strike can fuse sand into glass. When this occurs in nature hollow tubes called fulgurites are formed. Cueball uses this knowledge and a spark of handiness and ingenuity to create an entirely home made glass necklace for Megan. Here is some inspiration to do it yourself.\nThe title text represents an answer to the logical question prompted by this comic, which is "Would this actually work?".  The implied answer is "Yes", but only "for some value of \'actually work\'".\nThis is a play on the phrase "for some value of x", used frequently in physics or mathematics when it\'s not necessary (nor easy, maybe not even possible) to calculate a suitable value of x.  For example, if you supply energy to a Flux Capacitor, could it turn a DeLorean into a time machine?  The answer is yes, if you have sufficient energy (the \'x\', in this case).\nAny sensible person would take Randall\'s response to mean it most likely "doesn\'t actually work". But a romantic person (who may be in love and thus not sensible) might give it a try anyway. It worked for Cueball...\n\n
