n\nCueball seems to be using a common cheesy pick up line. So, how do you like your eggs in the morning? \xe2\x80\x94 implying that he will be the one cooking them, because they will still be together in the morning, after they spent the night having sex. The standard response to this pick up line for a woman seeking to brush off the potential partner \xe2\x80\x94 as one would expect a woman in a bar being propositioned by a stranger to do most of the time \xe2\x80\x94 is "unfertilized", switching the meaning of "eggs" from chicken eggs to female gametes. In fact, Cueball is not trying to solicit sex from Megan, but instead is trying to set her up for that punchline as he is in the habit of setting up jokes. Megan\'s desire for actual casual sex subverts his plan for comedy.\nThe title text is a response to the comment about a Priest and a Rabbi. Jokes about Priests, Rabbis are fairly common, and the man appears to want to set up such a joke. However, the title text uses sarcasm to point out that such religious leaders would be unlikely to frequent a bar where people go for casual sex.\nAlternatively, the title text could be implying that this is a bar where most people are looking for casual sex, and jokers are a common nuisance, in contrast with bars where most women are not looking for a hookup and men who troll for casual sex are a common nuisance.\n\n
