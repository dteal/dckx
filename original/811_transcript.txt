n\nMegan talks with Beret Guy about the journey of light through the universe from its source to our eyes. In Megan\'s opinion, it is very sad that this journey is pointless - light\'s travel ends only with us seeing "pretty dots" - stars in the sky. Beret Guy then tries to return light to its birthplace by using a mirror, which reflects light back to its source.  \nThe title text is a reference to special relativity, which states that from the point of view of a light particle, the distance is zero because it is moving at the speed of light, so it takes no time to go anywhere. Note that the title text says that relativity saves the day again. This could be a reference to a previous comic 660: Sympathy in which a socially inept physicist touches upon using some consequences of special relativity to save a friend\'s deceased brother.\n\n
