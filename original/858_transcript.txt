n\nMegan and Cueball are sitting quietly, engaged in their own solo pursuits.  Without any preamble, Megan answers a question that has not been asked, pointing out to Cueball that he would not be able to obtain milk from her breasts right now, as she is not lactating.  Cueball is flabbergasted that she seems to have read his mind, as this was exactly what he was wondering.\nThis comic is a comment on the fascination and sheer lack of knowledge that men have about women\'s bodies in general, and their breasts in particular.\nMegan, like any other adult female mammal, is capable of producing milk from her mammary glands.  However, this facility is not always available; Megan would have to get pregnant and give birth to trigger the bodily changes that result in lactation. This is unless she can perform lactation without pregnancy. It is possible, but extremely hard.\nIn the third panel, Megan\'s legs are not seen, probably tucked under the armchair to feel more secure.\nThe title text indicates that this is not proof of Megan\'s psychic powers, as Cueball seems quite obsessed with this particular topic. Although if you interpret it as a response to Cueball\'s thoughts in the last panel it could remain ambiguous.\n\n
