n\n"Toot my own horn" is an idiom meaning to brag. However, Black Hat takes this literally and toots (blows) an air horn. An air horn is a horn attached to a can of compressed air, and at close range is extremely loud.\nBlack Hat\'s actions could also be interpreted as punishment of Cueball, who began by claiming that he didn\'t want to boast about his accomplishments, but then did so anyway. \nThe Vuvuzela is a noise-generating instrument, mainly used for making noise at soccer matches in South Africa. This comic was published during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, and the constant buzzing from vuvuzelas throughout the matches attracted attention and controversy.\n\n
