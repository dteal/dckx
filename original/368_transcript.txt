n\nBlack Hat and Cueball are standing inside a room behind a window hearing an obnoxious car outside playing loud music with deep bass. Black Hat created a machine that is able to blow out the car\'s speakers (by playing the same soundwaves back at them, but with the phase slightly offset, the phase difference will set up a resonance in the car\'s speakers big enough for them to destroy themselves). In a stroke of evil, he then starts playing Shirley Ellis\' The Name Game to show how annoying the man was acting. At the end Black Hat probably tops this by playing the song Macarena.\nThe title text refers to comic 316: Loud Sex, where an elliptical reflector is used to focus sound waves.\n\n
