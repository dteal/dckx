n\nTVtropes is a popular site which allows conversation on tropes. A common joke with the site is how you will read a page, find a certain trope, which will open another tab on your web page. Then, as you read another article, you\'ll open even more pages. Pretty soon, this will cause an extremely long cycle of opening new pages and closing old ones.\nIn the comic, this is exactly what happens to our unfortunate victim. He starts on a single page, then opens more and more tabs on different pages. Pretty soon, he finds himself stuck in a loop of opening pages.\nThe last frame refers to Rickrolling, which is the practice of being linked to Rick Astley\'s "Never Gonna Give You Up" on YouTube.\nThe title text refers to the comedy site Cracked.com. This site is also known for its addictive articles. Most articles are formatted in the same way the title text notes. Eventually, Cracked itself wrote a column that paid tribute to this cartoon. (See the very last line With that in mind, we present to you the 17 Worst Haircuts in The Ottoman Empire.)\nThe original comic links to TVtropes\' page of Universal tropes. TVtropes has taken notice and has a welcome letter for you at the end of the main article: "Oh, and hello to all you xkcd readers. (And thank you - for the information!)" Here the "thank you" link actually links to this page, the "hello" links to the comic on xkcd and the other two links are to two articles on TVTropes, the first about xkcd and the last one referring to this comic about how TVTropes will ruin your life.\n\n
