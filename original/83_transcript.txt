n\nKatamari Damacy is a Japanese game in which the player must roll around an infinitely sticky katamari ball, cottoning up objects and terrain to increase the ball\'s size. In this comic, Cueball uses the katamari as an analogy for his love for Megan, pushing it to such embarrassing extremes that Megan feels the need to remark whether he could "possibly get any gayer." At this point, Cueball wins the level he is playing and is transported by a "Royal Rainbow," an in-game occurrence at the completion of each level. The rainbow is a symbol of gay pride, in addition to being just a generally happy and "gay" idea.\nCueball also only takes up such a stand after Megan requests that he help her. This is possibly a criticism of male selfishness (perhaps Randall\'s self-criticism), in that males do not discuss romantic ideas, except as a way out.\nThe King of All Cosmos, mentioned in the title text, is an instructive character in all of the Katamari games. The title text points out that perhaps we like video games not because they are fun, but because they let us forget what is on our mind and become engrossed with the task.\nThe game is also subject of 161: Accident.\n\n
