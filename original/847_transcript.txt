n\n\n\n \n\n This explanation may be incomplete or incorrect: More on the LOTR quote and Sam\'s experience to compare to what Cueball faced in his youth. Not enough to just tie it in in the title text explanation.If you can address this issue, please edit the page! Thanks.\n\nThe Stingray Nebula, in the constellation Ara, is the youngest known planetary nebula in the galaxy. It was formed by an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) B1 supergiant, which blasted out the gas while becoming a white dwarf in 1987. Well, it happened about 18,000 years ago, but the light of the incident reached the Earth in 1987.\nThis comic went from a reassuring comic about stars at night giving hope in the darkness, but then as with most xkcd\'s, it took a turn.  In this case, the twist is that because Cueball\'s star he got attached to exploded into a nebula, we should only become attached to stars that aren\'t quite as volatile as the one that formed the Stingray Nebula.\nThe title text ties into the Tolkien quote. E\xc3\xa4rendil, with a Silmaril strapped to his forehead, is the Tolkeinian myth explanation for the planet Venus, which has historically been mistaken for a star due to its brightness, being known as the "morning star" or "evening star". Venus will eventually (in billions of years time) be engulfed by the sun\'s expansion into a red giant. The source of Sam\'s comfort is also temporary in the long term.\n\n
