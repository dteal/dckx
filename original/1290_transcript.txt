n\nCueball wants to say ri-fucking-diculous, but he inserts the fucking too late in the word. Now, he has to say ridicu-fucking-lous, which sounds ri-fucking-diculous.\nThis is an example of tmesis, the breaking up of a word to include another within it, and more specifically of expletive infixation. Normally, for rhythmic reasons the included word is inserted before the stressed syllable (ridiculous becoming ri-fucking-diculous) which is what Cueball messed up. However, in some cases it is also possible to break the word after a prefix instead, so for some words there are two ways to do it e.g. unbe-fucking-lievable (before the stressed syllable) or un-fucking-believable; this is because unbelievable is a combination of un and believable to negate believable which is an actual English word and therefore it still sounds good.\nThe title text introduces a further example, with speaker inserting the fucking too late into the word absolutely\xe2\x80\x94which would have resulted in absolute-fucking-ly\xe2\x80\x94but leaving the word unfinished when they realize their mistake. The more usual tmesis here would be abso-fucking-lutely.\n\n
