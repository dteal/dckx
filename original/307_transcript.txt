n\nMegan just wants to have a normal conversation about the moon, but Cueball replies with a quote from Star Wars, when Ben Kenobi said, "That\'s no moon, that\'s a space station." Megan cuts him off in the manner of another Star Wars character, villain Darth Vader, and showing a glimmer of the character\'s abilities, proceeds to choke him with "The Force" while modifying another phrase from the same film. (The original quotation was, "I find your lack of faith disturbing.")\nThere is humor in Megan\'s hypocrisy, however. Although she is disturbed by Cueball\'s unoriginal dialogue, she is fine with doing it herself.\nStar Wars fans are a weird bunch, however, and the title text states that if a male Star Wars fan met a girl who could do this in real life, it\'d only serve to turn him on even more.\n\n
