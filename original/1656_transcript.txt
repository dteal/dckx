n\nThis comic encourages the reader to post random news stories on the Internet, under the line "It begins." This creates a sense of impending doom, as well as making people wonder what, exactly, is being referred to. This could also encourage people to theorize about what, exactly, is beginning. It could also just confuse the intended audience, as they try to comprehend what the author is saying.\nThis could in the worst case speedily lead to several people making repost of such a non-news story that would not have gotten any attention otherwise. This may lead to speculation, and other curious theories, going out the tangent it could create fear or mass hysteria.\nSome stories that might benefit especially from this are those relating to machine autonomy, animal attacks, disease, and so forth. This would call to mind various popular culture and/or scientific hypothetical scenarios.\nPerhaps the comic\'s choice of article refers to Alfred Hitchcock\'s thriller The Birds, in which birds (especially seagulls) begin attacking humans for no apparent reason, or the broader idea of an animal revolution, or just that even animals get sick of us always looking at our smart phones.\nThe title text instructs readers to try the line "Yikes" instead. The idea is the same but would give a completely different response.\nOther comics which advocate using catch-all phrases as standard responses for any comment:\n\n174: That\'s What SHE Said\n178: Not Really Into Pokemon\n559: No Pun Intended\n1022: So It Has Come To This\n1215: Insight\n1627: Woosh\n\n
