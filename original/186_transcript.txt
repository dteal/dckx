n\nThis comic relates to video game consoles. At the time this comic was published, there were three major products competing: the Playstation 3 by Sony, the Xbox 360 by Microsoft and the Wii by Nintendo. When a game console gets released, fans are often seen queuing outside the stores or camping on the pavement in order to be among the first to get their hands on a console. The comic shows such a console camp and points out the differences between the fan communities. While the fans waiting in line for a Sony or Microsoft product are very rude, the Nintendo fans are apologetic and try to comfort (that is to say, console) those who arrived too late to obtain a package. The clich\xc3\xa9 that Nintendo fans are nicer and more polite may be attributed to the fact that the Wii is targeted at children and families while the PS3 and the Xbox are targeted at the "serious gamer" crowd.\nThe title text primarily expresses Randall\'s distance from the console wars (he has never owned a game console before)while also indicating an inclination towards the Nintendo Wii.\n\n
