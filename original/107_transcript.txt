n\nSnakes on a Plane is a 2006 movie starring Samuel L. Jackson. It features (surprisingly) snakes, on a plane, attacking the passengers. This comic proposes a sequel, taking the idea to the next level, making things infinitely worse: snakes on every plane!\nTo have snakes on every plane is much worse than snakes on just one, but since the original movie was quite bad in most opinions, the suggested poster would make it seem like the advertisers are shooting down their own movie; "This one is even worse!".\nIn the title text Randall also credits James with the idea.\n\n
