n\nRob is having online chats with what appears at first glance to be a woman. However, he grows suspicious at the apparent consumerism dedication of the "woman" - and perhaps of the perfection of the online connection, touching on the stereotypical nerd fear that any relationship going well must contain some secret flaw - and so requests that they both "get tested". The woman on the other end of the computer does not pass a CAPTCHA test and is unable to prove she is a human.\nThis is an internet version of the Turing test. A spambot is a program that sends out emails or links such as in the title text to simulate a human\'s writing but contains advertising. This test is called "VK", which stands for Voight-Kampff, which is an empathy test in the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and film Blade Runner which determines human from replicant.\nIn using the phrase "get tested", the comic is making a pun that refers both to the CAPTCHA test above and the STD or VD test that couples will take to make sure they are physically free of communicable diseases.\nThe name "Lisa" may be an allusion to ELIZA, one of the first chatbots, written in 1966. According to its (hers?) creator, people became "quickly and deeply emotionally involved with the computer program" during the chat.\nThe title text is the spambot\'s last sad goodbye \xe2\x80\x94 it includes lots of product advertisements and links, such as an online advertiser may insert into a search results page.\n329: Turing Test is another comic dealing with Turing tests/CAPTCHAs.\n\n
