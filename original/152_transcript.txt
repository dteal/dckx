n\nThe comic starts with a genie, who, having been freed from a magical lamp, grants the owner three wishes; this isn\'t unusual, since the idea of a genie that does this is a very common trope in the fantasy genre.\nCueball asks for a human-sized hamster ball, and when he gets it, he starts to roll around in it, obviously entertained.\nThe genie then asks what he would like for his other two wishes, to which, having being granted already his heart\'s desire, he states he wouldn\'t need the other wishes for anything.\nThe title text refers to the activity of Zorbing. And later Randall found out where to get one and went on a hamster ball heist, and hamster balls has been a recurring theme on xkcd since this comic.\nGenies (or magic lamps) are mentioned in at least three other comics:\n\n532: Piano \n879: Lamp \n1391: Darkness\n\nIn the first two Randall manages to use the concept to make penis related jokes.\nIn the third the issue of number of wishes is discussed, from the perspective of wanting more than three wishes. The issue of wishing for more wishes is also the subject of 1086: Eyelash Wish Log, so it is not always enough with one or even three wishes!\n\n
