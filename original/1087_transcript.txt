n\nThis comic is a mash-up between the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the novel Charlotte\'s Web.\nThe title Cirith Ungol is a reference to Lord of the Rings where Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were led to Cirith Ungol by Gollum and to the lair of the ancient spider Shelob.\nAnd therefore in this comic, Frodo (by himself) is being led into the lair of the spider, Charlotte. We can tell by the "Some Pig" writing in the spider web on the lower right hand corner which is a direct reference to the story of Charlotte\'s Web, in which a spider named Charlotte writes the very same text in her web.\nThe title text refers to syntactic ambiguity which is a property of sentences which may be reasonably interpreted in more than one way, or reasonably interpreted to mean more than one thing. This allows us to derive two different meanings from the same sentence. \nThe second part of the title text is a quote from Wikipedia, which Randall enjoys for its  syntactic ambiguity, as it can be logically interpreted in either of the following ways:\n\nCharlotte the spider saves Wilbur from slaughter.\nCharlotte the spider attempts to slaughter Wilbur, but he is saved.\n\nThis quote was modified the same day the comic appeared [1]. It could be found on Wikiquote until 27 April 2016.\nA similar ambiguity explicitly discussed in the title text of 1004: Batman.\n\n
