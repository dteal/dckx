n\nOn Unix-like systems, cron is a system utility that runs tasks on a schedule.  This program has been around since the early days of Unix and has not changed much - it is still one of the most widely used functions in modern operating systems.  Many administrative tasks on servers are automated using cron, including monitoring and updates.\nWhen a cron job produces output, cron\'s default behavior is to send an email to the user account under which the job ran.  However, in most situations, an email address has not been set up for that user, so the email is instead written to a mailbox file.  Most Unix shells will notify the user with a message like "You have new mail" when this mailbox file is updated, but if the user doesn\'t know how to check this mail file, they will likely just ignore the message.\nIn this case, Cueball has been ignoring his mailbox for fifteen years.  When he finally learns where to look, he discovers more than a gigabyte worth of messages from the cron program, the vast majority of which are likely meaningless.  Ponytail suggests that Cueball "fix your cron" (likely meaning to fix the task that\'s generating the output so that it doesn\'t do so), then set a parameter that tells cron to send email to an address he actually checks.  (He could also opt to direct the mails to /dev/null, which would discard them, or simply disable the mail in the crontab.)  Cueball, however, interprets the tremendous amount of email as spam and decides to redirect the emails to /etc/crontab, the main configuration file that contains all of cron\'s scheduling information.  He apparently believes that this will either stop the emails or cause cron to spam itself instead.\nIn reality, this will not cause significant problems as the MAILTO environmental variable in cron takes an email address or usernames on the local system and attempts to send emails to them.  It will not write or append output to a local file like /etc/crontab.  Thus when cron attempts to email /etc/crontab the mail program cron uses will generate an error saying it can\'t find the user /etc/crontab. \nFor example, if you create the following crontab:\n\n\nMAILTO=/etc/crontab\n\n* * * * * echo &quot;Some output from a cronjob&quot;\n\ninstalled on a user named me on a system called mycomputer then you will see a new error messages email to you (located in /var/mail/me) stating it can\'t send email to a user named /etc/crontab and the undelivered email is being returned to the sender.  The error email will look like the following: \n\n\nFrom MAILER-DAEMON  Tue Sep  6 14:47:01 2016\nReturn-Path: &lt;&gt;\nX-Original-To: [email&#160;protected]/*  */\nDelivered-To: [email&#160;protected]/*  */\nReceived: by mycomputer.local (Postfix)\n        id 5341C64EE516; Tue,  6 Sep 2016 14:47:01 -0400 (EDT)\nDate: Tue,  6 Sep 2016 14:47:01 -0400 (EDT)\nFrom: [email&#160;protected]/*  */ (Mail Delivery System)\nSubject: Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender\nTo: [email&#160;protected]/*  */\nAuto-Submitted: auto-replied\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/report; report-type=delivery-status;\n        boundary=&quot;33AF864EE514.1473187621/mycomputer.local&quot;\nMessage-Id: &lt;[email&#160;protected]/*  */&gt;\n\nThis is a MIME-encapsulated message.\n\n--33AF864EE514.1473187621/mycomputer.local\nContent-Description: Notification\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\n\nThis is the mail system at host mycomputer.local.\n\nI\'m sorry to have to inform you that your message could not\nbe delivered to one or more recipients.
