n\nThis comic refers to the film Jurassic Park, a 1993 movie based on the 1990 novel by Michael Crichton. The film centers around a billionaire who bought an island and opened a zoo or theme park for dinosaurs which he has cloned from DNA recovered from blood found in fossilized mosquitoes. After a security guard shuts down the security systems to steal embryos for a rival company, several of the creatures, among which are the Velociraptors subject of this comic, run loose and try to devour every human in the theme park.\nVelociraptors (often shortened to "raptors") are a species of relatively small, carnivorous dinosaur which play a central role in the original film, as well as its sequels. In the film, herds of Velociraptors antagonize the main characters at various points, even entering buildings. According to newer researches, the Velociraptors in the film were erroneously based on the Utahraptor species of dinosaur. Unlike the movie, in which they are depicted as having a reptilian skin, both species of dinosaur in reality are theorized to have been feathered. The word "raptor" also refers to modern birds of prey.\nRandall is asked to substitute for Miss Lenhart in math class. The first page of the test he devises contains three questions, which have the recurring theme of humans running from said velociraptors. As Randall says in the comic: "This material is more vital than anything you\'ve ever learned," the joke being that Randall is somehow fearful that such a thing could happen.\nVelociraptors, and in particular, the irrational fear of being attacked by them in the modern world, appear several times in xkcd. This is the second such instance, the first is 87: Velociraptors\n\n
