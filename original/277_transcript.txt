n\nThis strip depicts a common experience to most people, becoming frustrated with a device, system, or rule that appears to be badly made or have no purpose other than to frustrate the user (in this case, a traffic light that seems unreasonably, inexplicably long). One temptation we might have in these cases is to blame the designer of the system. Here, the designer appears and testifies to the amount of effort that went into the design, considering many factors. He challenges Cueball to come up with a better solution, the implication being that without a similar amount of training and effort, any naive solution would have flaws the designer would be happy to point out. This demonstrates to Cueball and the reader that just because they were unlucky enough to encounter something in a way that was inconvenient for no obvious reason, doesn\'t mean there is no reason at all.\nOf course, all of this has occurred after the designer leapt out of nowhere onto the hood of the car, so he may not be entirely stable. This is capitalized on in the final panel, wherein he finally admits that red light won\'t change until Tuesday (presumably a day or more beyond the current time), meaning that the timing scheme really was absurd after all. This comic was published on Friday; it seems Cueball has to wait a few days more.\nThe title text returns to the original point, reminding us that designers work hard and often encounter complex problems in doing their jobs. Their frustration may also be in part from the knowledge that future users will blame them for unavoidable problems and undervalue their work. With a little empathy, we can find a human connection to these problems rather than let them drive us crazy.\nRandall returns to the theme of the unseen contributions of engineers in 1741: Work.\n\n
