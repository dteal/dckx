n\nAsbestos is a fibrous material most commonly used for its heat-resistant properties. It was commonly used in housing insulation until its astonishingly destructive effects on human lungs were known. The use of asbestos in housing is now banned, but it is still quite common in laboratory hot pads, as well as in concrete industrial buildings where the risk of it getting into the air is minimal.\nThe comic depicts a common advertising trick taken to an absurd extreme; quite clearly all of the cereal products depicted are asbestos-free, but most have opted not to advertise the fact because it should be obvious. A more realistic example can be found in confectionery products, wherein the term "fat free" might be applied when it\'s clear that sugar, gelatin, and other ingredients involved in the product are in no way related to, or contain, fat.\nIronically, the "asbestos-free" disclaimer could also cause a customer to distrust the product on the grounds of damning by faint praise\xe2\x80\x94if the best thing they can say about a product is that it doesn\'t contain a toxic building material, do we really want to know what actually is in this stuff?\nThe claim in the title text\xe2\x80\x94that the product has no swine flu\xe2\x80\x94is equally superfluous, as any food product containing disease-causing viruses would be subject to recalls, severe fines, and quite a few people losing their jobs; the fact that the product is actually on a supermarket shelf implies that it already has a stellar reputation for not causing serious illness. The use of it here could also be a reference to 574: Swine Flu.\nStay Puft is also the company that produces marshmallows in the movie franchise  Ghostbusters.\nRedFarm is a Chinese restaurant in NYC.\nMisleading advertising is also the subject of the previous comic 624: Branding, and of subsequent comics 870: Advertising and 993: Brand Identity.\n\n
