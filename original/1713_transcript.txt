n\nThis comic presents a busy day in the clinic for doctor Ponytail, who orders 50 ccs from a nurse (probably Megan who walks in front of her rather than Cueball walking away behind her), all the while everyone is hurrying along the hall. This could be a typical scenario in a busy hospital. However the pun is that the 50 ccs are not medicine but should be used to write "hiccup vaccine" 25 times...\nIn medicine, "cc" usually means "cubic centimeter", and is often called that by medical personnel. A cubic centimeter is equal to 1\xc2\xa0ml (milliliter), so "50 ccs" usually means 50 ml of a certain medicine. In this case however, the doctor has not told the nurse to bring 50 ccs of any given medicine; she needs to write "hiccup vaccine" 25 times, with both words containing the letter combination "cc", so she needs to write those combination 50 times. \nThat is the joke, that the 50 ccs literally means the two-lettered \'cc\' fifty times.\n\n50 cc would be\ncc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc\n just enough \'cc\'s to spell hiccup vaccine 25 times. \n\n\nThere\'s no conventional vaccine against hiccups. However, performing tasks meant to distract one\'s self is a method to stop hiccups.  Therefore the act of writing "hiccup vaccine" 25 times would itself comprise one more of those hiccup cures that never seems to work.\nThe title text text refers to a fictional event with four words containing "cc" (raccoon, accident, accordion, bacchanalia), which means she needs to write "cc" 100 times. Referring to the 50 ccs from above, this would be a double dosage.\nAlthough the words of the sentence has been chosen based on their cc\'s the sentence is quite interesting in itself:\n\nAn accordion is a box-shaped musical instrument with tangents like on a piano. The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows. It has sometimes been accused of being a hellish instrument.  It has not been used in xkcd before.\nThe Bacchanalia were Roman festivals of Bacchus (Roman name for the equivalent Greek wine God Dionysus). The festivals were based on various ecstatic elements of the Greek Dionysia. \nThe animal raccoon, has begun to appear in urban areas which has given rises to increasing conflicts with humans. A dead raccoon had thus found its way into Cueball\'s car in 1565: Back Seat and already back in 1025: Tumblr Megan has a  raccoon sex dungeon in her attic!\n\nSo here there is talk of a wine festival with music played on accordions that has had an accident involving raccoons, in addition to the need for vaccine against the hiccups.\nA similar doctor Ponytail is shown in 883: Pain Rating also along with Cueball and Megan and just with Megan in 996: Making Things Difficult.\n\n
