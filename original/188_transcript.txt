n\nThis comic refers to the common method for reloading your ammunition in arcade game type shooters, also known as "rail shooters". The player is typically given a Light gun, and the player characters typically have unlimited magazines of ammunition; to load a new magazine, the player would aim his light gun away from the screen and pull the trigger.\nThe title text tells you to watch out for the guy from comic 53: Hobby, which shows a man who randomly pops up to the police when they are performing a drug raid. This refers to the random figures that pop out at many games; if they are not a valid target and you shoot them, you will lose points.\n\n
