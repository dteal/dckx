n\nThe comic specifies a function (in a C-like syntax), which judging by its name should be designed to return a random number. Most functions of this form are random number generators, meaning that on subsequent calls they return different random numbers. But the programmer has instead implemented a function that just returns always the same random number; which, while it could indeed have been truly randomly chosen by rolling a dice as the comment documented, is essentially worthless were it ever to be called more than once (with the expectation of different, i.e., random, results).  In other words, the results over time would not be random at all, but completely predictable and deterministic.\nThe IEEE is the organization responsible for maintaining a number of computer standards. An RFC, or Request for Comments, is a formal document put out to computing experts by IETF in the hopes of becoming a future standard. However, RFC 1149 was an April Fools\' joke, defining how carrier pigeons can be used to transmit Internet packets. "RFC 1149.5", meanwhile, simply does not exist.\n\n
