n\nMegan (in one of the few comics where she is actually named) and Ponytail are playing together on an online multiplayer shooter game. Ponytail calls Cueball, who is living with Megan, and easily persuades him to make nachos. Wi-Fi and microwave ovens both use radio frequencies around 2.4 GHz, so Cueball\'s cooking disrupts Megan\'s connection and allows Ponytail to kill Megan\'s character. Boom! Headshot is a catchphrase made popular through a web mockumentary series called Pure Pwnage, and is also used in the game League of Legends by the character Nidalee.\nThe title text points out that Megan has only herself to blame, as gaming on WiFi is susceptible to such issues, while gaming with a wired connection (e.g. Ethernet) is not.\nNote: If using the microwave actually does interfere with your WiFi, then get another microwave. Not (strictly) because it would mess with the WiFi, but because your microwave has a hole somewhere and is leaking non-ionizing radiation it shouldn\'t. It won\'t kill you, but it\'s not operating at peak efficiency. See this video on the subject.\nAround the time of this comic\'s release, the XKCD website was temporarily redesigned using Yahoo!
