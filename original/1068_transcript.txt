n\nCueball has installed SwiftKey on his smartphone and brags about this to Megan. SwiftKey is a product that is installable on iOS/Android-based phones and tablets.\nCueball explains that if you type space bar on the keyboard it auto completes the word you are currently typing founded on its best guess, and then if you continue to press space it will add new words using this guessing process based on the previous word(s) and what it believes is the most likely words you would use in a sentence containing the previous word(s).\nMegan asks what happens if you begin a new message by just using space to automatically create a text. Cueball\'s best guess it begins with the word SwiftKey has found to be the typical starting word and then continues as normal from that.\nMegan then realizes that in this way it builds up his "typical" sentence and she tries this over the next eight small frames: I am so sorry- that\'s never happened before.\n"I\'m so sorry\xe2\x80\x93 that\'s never happened before." is a typical excuse for a mishap, usually when one fails to obtain an erection when it is needed. Such a phrase being quoted by an algorithm implies that such mishaps are common, and therefore "I\'m so sorry\xe2\x80\x93 that\'s never happened before." is a lie. Also Swiftkey might be saying "I\'m so sorry\xe2\x80\x93 that\'s never happened before." because the software doesn\'t know what to do.  \nSwiftKey have noticed their inclusion in xkcd and have created a blog post for other users to comment with their default phrase when they hit the "central prediction key". The results are pretty funny. In addition, reddit users have a similar model creating /r/subredditsimulator, which is populated by bots generating submissions and comments based on the language of their subreddits.\nIn the title text, a Markov chain refers to a system that transitions between a countable number of states, based only on the current state and none of the previous ones that led up to it. SwiftKey follows this property since it provides outputs based only on the most recently entered word or words, not the whole sentence.\n"Massachusetts Institute of America" is a nonexistent organization. The name appears to have formed by combining "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" and either "[Field] Institute of America" (e.g. Mining) or "United States of America". This illustrates the memoryless property of a Markov chain; after generating "Massachusetts Institute of", SwiftKey may have attempted to predict the next word using only the last "of" or "Institute of". Since it was not considering the word "Massachusetts" at all, the word "America" was viewed as the most likely follow-up.\n\n
