n\nDigital rights management (DRM), is a class of methods for controlling digital files, such as by preventing media from playing on any device besides the device from which the purchase is made. It is used by several major companies, as it makes it more difficult to pirate media, which they claim cuts into their profits. Those companies typically also lobby for laws forbidding circumvention of DRM-teknikes, like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\nHowever, DRM is usually disliked by consumers, as it makes it difficult to use their purchased media. For example, if they buy a new computer, there\'s no guarantee their DRM-covered media will be usable on the new computer. Thus, Black Hat is suggesting to the pro-DRM organizations Sony, Microsoft, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and Apple that they stop their DRM-fiddling and lobbying, and he\'ll stop his inexorable ice-wall.\nThe title text refers readers to law professor Lawrence Lessig\'s book \'Free Culture\'.\n\n
