n\nThis comic is a list of questions which Randall has about the Solar System, which at first glance may appear to be things that Randall would like to learn about.\nIn actuality, most of the questions have not been satisfactorily answered or proven by anyone in the scientific community.\n\n\n\n\n Question given\n\n Answer given by Randall (in red in the original)\n\n Comments\n\n\n Why is the the Moon so blotchy?\n\n Lava\n\n The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, which means that we always can see only one half of the surface of the Moon. And on that side we can see large lunar maria formed by lava from big volcanoes. This surface is very different from all other celestial bodies we know in our Solar system. The double "the the" could be a Randallism \xe2\x80\x94 intended or unintended.\n\n\n Why are all the blotches on the near side?\n\n ...\n\n The nearside of the Moon is dominated by the blotchy \'seas\' or maria, the far side by craters. Several explanations for this have been proposed, including an overabundance of impacts obliterating the blotches on the more exposed far side, different compositions of heat-producing elements, large collisions, or heat produced by the still-cooling Earth.\n\n\n Did Mars have seas?\n\n Yes (briefly?)\n\n Recent explorations have confirmed there was once standing (and also flowing) water on Mars.  Many rovers and orbiters on Mars give us the evidence on this early development of that planet, but it is still unknown how long such conditions existed in its history. Two of these probes have been the subject of comics before: 695: Spirit and 1504: Opportunity.\n\n\n Was there life on Mars?\n\n ...\n\n One of the big mysteries, not yet answered.\n\n\n What\'s Titan like?\n\n Cold, yellow, lakes + rivers (methane)\n\n The Cassini\xe2\x80\x93Huygens mission confirmed the presence of lakes and rivers on Titan. The Huygens lander itself returned some very yellow images of a dry lake bed from Titan\'s surface. The possibility of life on Titan was mentioned in 829: Arsenic-Based Life.\n\n\n What was Earth like during the Hadean?\n\n ...\n\n The Hadean was the first geologic era on earth, the planet had just formed and not much is known of that period of Earth. But since it was the time when Earth was formed it was mainly very hot with extreme volcanic activity, with the entire surface melted. This is why the era is named after Hades the ancient Greek god of the underworld, even though Hades was never associated with fire.\n\n\n Is the Oort Cloud a real thing?\n\n ...\n\n The Oort Cloud is a theoretical spherical cloud of icy planetesimals, maybe dust, and also larger objects at a distance of up to around 100,000 AU from our Sun. We can see similar clouds at other stars, but there is still no evidence that this cloud exists in our Solar System.\n\n\n Why is the Sun\'s corona so hot?\n\n Something about magnets?\n\n The corona of the sun is hotter than it theoretically should be. Tiny solar flares called nanoflares are responsible.\n\n\n What are comets like?\n\n Precipitous\n\n The Philae lander finally stopped moving when it ran into a cliff.\n\n\n Where\'s Philae, exactly?\n\n ...\n\n ...but we were not sure which cliff until September 5, 2016, when the European Space Agency announced that Philae had been found and photographed by Rosetta on the previous Friday (September 2). The landing of Philae was depicted in real time in the dynamic comic 1446: Landing. This lasted for several hours. Later the comic was updated with a new image where Philae is resting on the edge of a cliff.\n\n\n What\'s Pluto like?\n\n [Soon!]\n\n Pluto is so far from Earth and so small that traditional telescopes couldn\'t discern much about it. When this comic was released, the probe New Horizons was eight days away from its closest approach to Pluto and its moon Charon; Randall was naturally excited about it. The probe was the subject of the comic 1532: New Horizons.\n\n\n What\'s Charon like?\n\n\n Why don\'t we have in-between-sized planets?\n\n ...\n\n There is a size-gap between the rocky terrestrial planets up to Earth size and the gas giants very much larger than Earth in our Solar System.\nThere are many known exoplanets (planets in other solar systems) filling in the range between our rocky planets and our gas giants, known as Super-Earths\n\n\n\n What\'s Ceres like?\n\n [Working on it!]\n\n The Dawn probe is currently exploring the dwarf planet Ceres and reveals unseen surface features.\n\n\n Why is Europa so weird-looking and pretty?\n\n Ice over a water ocean\n\n Europa is a moon of Jupiter and the surface is basically thick pack ice covered in lineae.\n\n\n Why is Io so weird-looking?\n\n Sulfur volcanoes (? in the wrong places?)\n\n The moon Io is also orbiting Jupiter and is close enough that tidal forces make it the most volcanic object in the solar system. The moon is mainly yellow but there are several other colors on the surface, for instance spots and streaks of bright red that comes from sulfur ejected by the volcanoes. The "wrong places" refer to some volcanoes discovered by the Voyager missions and believed to erupt sulfur. But more recent measurements showed that the temperature inside those volcanoes is about 2.000&#160;\xc2\xb0C where this element is not liquid anymore but gas.\n\n\n Why are so many Kuiper Belt objects red?\n\n ...\n\n Many objects in the Kuiper Belt have a reddish hue. A possible explanation is that they are covered in organic molecules formed by the irradiation of their surface ices. The New Horizons probe might also shed light on this.\n\n\n What are those spots on Ceres?\n\n ...\n\n The Dawn probe found some mysterious spots on Ceres. These white spots are still not understood, but the mission is still running and we may figure out the source of the glowing white features. These spots became the punch line of the joke in 1476: Ceres.\n\n\n What\'s in the seas under Europa\'s ice?\n\n ...\n\n The ESA selected the mission Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) to Jupiter. The moon Europa is one target for that mission. But we have to wait, because its launch target is 2022 and the arrival at Jupiter is planned for 2030. But that\'s not uncommon for missions like this. New Horizons and Rosetta also traveled approximately ten years to reach their targets. And before such a mission can start many preparations have to be done. 2010: Odyssey Two is a 1982 science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke in which he envisions life under the ice on Europa. This life becomes a major plot point both in this and in the two sequels.\n\n\n Which of the other moons have seas?\n\n Several\n\n Randall has already mentioned above that there are liquids on two moons. The Moon Titan at Saturn has lakes on its surface formed by liquid ethane, methane, and propane and the Jupiter\'s moon Europa has a sea of water covered by a thick sheet of ice. Depending on the definition of \'sea\', other less obviously \'frozen water world\' moons such as Ganymede at Jupiter may have subsurface oceans of liquid water and on other moons it could be other substances that are liquid at the relevant temperature, like on Titan.\n\n\n What are the big white things in Titan\'s lakes?\n\n ...\n\n This is a joke about some gaps in the radar measurements as shown in this image.\n\n\n What do Jupiter\'s clouds look like up close?\n\n ...\n\n The Jupiter mission Galileo, operated by NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), arrived at Jupiter in 1995 and was sent to impact the planet at the end of that mission in 2003 to eliminate the possibility of contaminating local moons with terrestrial bacteria. Several measurements were done on the atmosphere but no pictures were sent back to Earth. So there is still no answer on this question.\n\n\n What\'s all that red stuff in the Great Red Spot?\n\n ...\n\n The Great Red Spot is a storm south of Jupiter\'s equator. Observations from Earth show a lifespan of more than 150 years. It\'s unknown why it\'s stable for that long a time and it\'s also not clear why the color is red. The probe Juno will arrive in July 2016 at Jupiter and maybe answer Randall\'s question.\n\n\n What\'s pushing the Pioneer probes?\n\n Heat from the RTG\n\n Discussed as the Pioneer anomaly. RTG stands for Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. This effect was mentioned (and explained a little differently) in the title text of 502: Dark Flow.\n\n\n What pushes spacecraft slightly during flybys?\n\n ...\n\n Several spacecraft experienced unexplained speed increases during Earth flybys. This is called the flyby anomaly.\n\n\n Where are all the Sun\'s neutrinos?\n\n Oscillating\n\n There are fewer observed electron neutrinos from the sun than the standard model predicts. This is called the Solar neutrino problem. Since the sum of all the neutrinos, regardless of type, that come from the sun add up to the predicted number of electron neutrinos it is theorized that neutrinos can change their type. This is called Neutrino oscillation, and can occur only if neutrinos have mass. Neutrino oscillation is considered a proof that the mass of a neutrino is non-zero. The mass of a neutrino is not yet measured and is one of the problems on the list of unsolved problems in physics on Wikipedia.\n\n\n Why is there so much air on Titan?\n\n ...\n\n Titan has an atmospheric pressure 1.45 times that of Earth, but only 1/7th of the surface gravity which is less than Earth\'s own airless Moon has, hence the confusion. In fact, Titan actually has almost 20% more atmosphere by mass than Earth, and seven times more atmosphere across a given surface area! Less influence from the more distant Sun probably helps retain more of the atmosphere\'s gases (for instance, Mars saw most of its atmosphere blasted away by the sun), and cryovolcanoes may replenish the methane fraction which should by now have all been converted into the other hydrocarbons present from subsurface reservoirs. Further studies are required to properly answer this question.\n\n\n Why does the Kuiper Belt stop?\n\n ...\n\n A reference to the Kuiper Cliff. Most Kuiper Belt Objects are found between 42 and 48 AU; calculations predicted that there would be more and larger KBOs beyond 50 AU, but instead very few objects have been found in that region. The reason for this is still unknown.\n\n\n Why is Iapetus weird-colored?\n\n ...\n\n Iapetus is a moon of Saturn and always keeps the same face towards Saturn. The trailing side is white while the other side is dark.\n\n\n Why does Iapetus have a belt?\n\n ...\n\n Iapetus has a 13&#160;km high ridge around most of the equator, and a number of 10-km-high mountains where the ridge is interrupted.\n\n\n What\'s the deal with Miranda?\n\n ...\n\n Miranda is the smallest of Uranus\' five round satellites, and it\'s a bit rough around the edges and also has an unusually high orbital inclination that is difficult to explain. Also possibly a Firefly reference since Miranda is also the name of a planet in Serenity, a film based on the Firefly TV series.\n\n\n Did Uranus and Neptune change places?\n\n ...\n\n The Nice model is a theory of how our solar system formed, which suggests the possibility of Uranus and Neptune having swapped places before reaching their current positions. Work by Professor S. Desch also came to this result.\n\n\n Did the Late Heavy Bombardment happen?\n\n ...\n\n The Late Heavy Bombardment is the name given to a theorized bombardment of the planet Earth during its early history, along with the other rocky planets around the Sun. It\'s believed that during that time many large objects still existed and are likely to have impacted the planets. On Earth the evidence for those impacts would have been destroyed, but on the Moon or Mercury some evidence may be available.\n\n\n Did life start before it?\n\n ...\n\n For some speculation on this topic, see Life Could Have Survived Earth\'s Early Bombardment. It is still a mystery if life was formed on Earth first or if it came from outer space.\n\n\n Is Europa covered in ice spikes?\n\n ...\n\nDr Daniel Hobley has put forward a theory that Jupiter\'s icy moon Europa has the right conditions to form ice spikes called penitentes of up to 10m in height.\n\n\n Why haven\'t we built a big inflatable Extreme Sports Complex on The Moon?\n\n ...\n\n Apart from the question on the white on Titan, this is the only really silly question that has nothing to do with science or the solar system. However, it would be fun to watch sports in such a stadium - see the title text. See also, e.g., The Menace From Earth, a 1957 short story by Robert Heinlein.\n\nThe title text refers to the 2015 FIFA Women\'s World Cup which was won by the USA the day before. The nylon wings and flying may be a reference to two passages from 3001: The Final Odyssey, one where Frank Poole tries out various wings while in an extremely low gravity environment, and one where he remarks while watching Swan Lake that Tchaikovsky could never have imagined a performance where the dancers were actually flying (due to aforementioned low gravity). This is also a reference to the last point on the list, because if we had such a stadium on the moon, maybe it would be possible to use such wings to make very long floating leaps.\n\n
