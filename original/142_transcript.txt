n\nThis comic is a part of the Parody Week, just joking about other webcomics. This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule and is comprised of the following five parodies:\n\n141: Parody Week: Achewood\n142: Parody Week: Megatokyo\n143: Parody Week: TFD and Natalie Dee\n144: Parody Week: A Softer World\n145: Parody Week: Dinosaur Comics\n\nMegatokyo is a webcomic by Fred Gallagher. Its art and storylines are heavily influenced by Japanese comics known as Manga.\nThe opening panel sets up a parody of Megatokyo here called megaxkcd. The girl is Ping, a robotic PS2 accessory, from the comic. The soft gray-scale art, hand-drawn "shadowed" panel borders, and vertical panel layout also mimic Megatokyo\'s design. \nThe joke begins with the main protagonist (probably Piro) has fallen in love with Ping, a game console accessory, and in today\'s comic he is supposed to come to term with this fact.\nBut then the parody is apparently aborted when two characters from the normal xkcd, Cueball and Black Hat, questions the parody as they are afraid of hurting artist Fred Gallagher\'s feelings. This itself is a dig at the sometimes maudlin and emotionally tender tone of Megatokyo, and in particular the self-conscious resemblance of anxious protagonist Piro to creator Gallagher, who based the character on a twentysomething version of himself. \nThis is one of the few comics where Black Hat is not his usual classhole self. So even he likes and approves of Fred and his comic! Actually Black Hat is the one most concerned for Fred\'s feelings, and he suggest they should go and cheer the poor guy up, now that he may have taken the parody kind of hard. Black Hat also yells to him that he should not cry, when he and Cueball arrive on his doorstep with a cake with lots of candles.\nThe title text reiterates the similarity between the style of the comic and the character of the artist behind it, which has been noted elsewhere as well. It also exclaims Randall\'s feelings for Fred, his webcomic and its style.\nFalling in love with a robot (or using one for sex) was later investigated in the Android series. And on 144: Parody Week: A Softer World love and robots are again investigated leading to a pregnant robot.\n\n
