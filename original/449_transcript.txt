n\nMegan and Cueball are about to break up, Megan is trying to explain things but Cueball is constantly saying "I love you", asserting that the fact that he loves her should be enough to keep her from breaking up with him. But while loving the other person is a necessary condition for sustainability, it is not a sufficient reason all on its own.\nAnd the title text relates that the mindset of someone believing that they are nothing without their partner&#8212;in other words, defining their identity in terms of the other person&#8212;is a dangerous and unhealthy sentiment. A person should have enough self-identity and sense of self-worth to know that they have value even outside the context of a relationship.\nThe title of the comic, "Things Fall Apart" could be a reference to the poem The Second Coming by W.B. Yeats, which contains the line "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold", implying that things between Megan and Cueball are falling apart, and the fact that Cueball is still in love with Megan (arguably, the "center" of the relationship) isn\'t enough to sustain them.\n\n
