n\nThis comic is based on a common annoyance when job hunting, being told that they\'ll "keep you in mind", but don\'t offer you a job. A job interviewer tells Black Hat exactly that.\nBlack Hat offers a briefcase to his interviewer. From the vague phrasing "this" and the context, one would expect the briefcase to contain money to bribe the interviewer into hiring Black Hat. Instead, it contains a portal or gateway into an impossibly deep chasm.\nAfter falling through the chasm, the interviewer lands in the interviewee\'s seat, and Black Hat is now sitting in the interviewer\'s seat, effectively switching their roles.\nThe former interviewer tries to pull the same trick on Black Hat, creating a momentary illusion of an infinite loop through recursion, a common theme in xkcd comics.\nWhen Black Hat opens the briefcase, however, he reveals another common annoyance when job hunting, being told that the opening has already been filled. Black Hat\'s statement works on two levels, one meaning that "the job opening has been filled", and the second meaning "the opening to the briefcase\'s chasm has been filled".\nThe title text is said by Black Hat. It refers to the fact that, even though Black Hat now has the interviewer\'s job, he has no idea what his function is.\nOther Job interviews have been portrayed in 125: Marketing Interview, 1088: Five Years, 1293: Job Interview and 1545: Strengths and Weaknesses.\n\n
