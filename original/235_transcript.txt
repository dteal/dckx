n\nThis comic presents, through a surreal scenario, one of Randall\'s recurring themes: that it is better to take a chance and make an interesting choice.\nCueball flies a kite, then fixes it to a tree and climbs its string. In real life, of course, the string would not be able to support the weight of a human, but let\'s ignore that for now. Up in the sky, Megan appears hanging on a blimp, looking at him throughout the encounter. Cueball wonders about her and considers talking to her, but he does not act. After she has gone, Cueball is alone again; nothing has changed.\nThe title text explains the meaning of this metaphor. It is easy to regret an awkward conversation you had. In contrast, you don\'t regret the conversations you didn\'t have the nerve to start, because their cost is invisible--yet, they may have been missed opportunities, possibly a much higher cost than a simple awkward conversation.\nLater in the 1614: Kites title text it turns out that other people (Beret Guy) can also fly with a kite.\n\n
