n\nIt is an old superstition that a groundhog (a type of rodent akin to a large squirrel) can predict the seasonal change from winter to spring in early February.  A groundhog that sees his shadow and retreats back in his home predicts another six weeks of winter, while a groundhog that does not see its shadow predicts an early spring.  This event is celebrated in a small town in western Pennsylvania, where Punxsutawney Phil serves as the forecaster in an annual ceremony on February 2.  This, in turn, becomes the basis for the comedy movie Groundhog Day that is also referred in 1076: Groundhog Day.\nThe joke here is that, instead of a groundhog predicting when spring will come, the baby is predicting the change in season. Evidently, he predicts we will have six more weeks of winter.\nThe title text indicates that the doctor was joking about the baby retreating back inside. He then makes a pun which results in an assault by the mother. The word delivery can mean the act of giving birth or the presentation of a joke. He then indicates that the baby is fine.\n\n
