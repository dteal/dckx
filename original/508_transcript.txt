n\nFor those not familiar, this comic is a play on the classic question guys ask women, where drapes=head hair and carpet=pubic hair. The assumption is that some people artificially dye their head hair, but typically would not dye other body hair. The question is essentially asking "Are you a \'natural\' red-head/blonde/etc.?". The classic question doesn\'t mention upholstery, hence Cueball\'s confusion. There is some speculation about other body/arm/leg/arm-pit hair interpretations for upholstery.\nThis comic could also be a self-referential joke where the furniture is a double entendre to the art of the comic itself. The "carpet" is the white background of the comic, which matches the black "drapes" of Cueball, the woman, and the words. The "upholstery", in this case, is the woman\'s hair, which is colored and heavily bordered to create a 3D effect, which does not at all match the rest of this comic. The fact that Cueball seems confused (as per the last panel and title text) suggests the fourth wall may have been broken.\n\n
