n\nIn the comic, by comparing three graphs, Cueball comes to the conclusion that the audience (presumably the owners/operators of "our site") should adjust their content or advertising to cater to Martha Stewart and furry porn fans. The actual reason the graphs are same is they all match the population concentration in the U.S., because there is no statistically-significant relation between geographic location and any of the mentioned sub-populations.\nA heatmap (the term having been coined and trademarked by Cormac Kinney) is a graph showing three-dimensional data on a two-dimensional image, with each pixel\'s colour representing the value of the data at that position.  It does not necessarily have anything to do with heat, but a heatmap may resemble a thermal image.  In this comic, red represents the highest numerical values, then yellow and green, with white the lowest values, in all three maps.\nThe title text reflects a similar situation in world maps where the website written in English is read by English-speaking users no matter the location, because their ISP and search providers direct them primarily to English websites, so the visitors\' geographic graph matches the graph of the global English-speaking population.\n\n
