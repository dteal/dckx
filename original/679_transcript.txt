n\nThis comic centers around a joke about Quantum Entanglement in physics - if you don\'t observe something, it has all possible states, not a specific one. It is a double-entendre with the word observe meaning both "look at" (physics sense) and "celebrate" (a holiday). One of the most famous examples on this is the Schr\xc3\xb6dinger\'s cat paradox.\nIn this comic, a Jewish physicist does not know when Christmas is. Being a physicist, he believes that since he doesn\'t observe Christmas, it therefore has no definite date.\nThe title text refers to another principle in physics where the act of measuring something must also change it in some way.  If one drops a thermometer into into a mug of water, energy spent (or released) when heating (or cooling) the mercury in the thermometer changes the temperature of the water in the mug by a small amount.  The only way not to interfere with the temperature of the water in the mug is not to measure it.\n\n
