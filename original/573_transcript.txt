n\nSet in the future, a daughter approaches her father playing a music video of Rick Astley\'s "Never Gonna Give You Up". The daughter insults her father\'s generation\'s versions of playing pranks, specifically Rickrolling. The daughter refers to this as "trolling" (part of the comics title), which is popular jargon for trying to disrupt a person or community via an action to elicit an emotional response. The humour is in that the dad reveals he has \'trolled\' his daughter, thus eliciting an emotional response which perfectly displays his prank. He has conditioned her so that her speech centers shut down whenever she is upset.\nIn this comic, the girl holds an ultra-thin tablet, a futuristic technology when released, a year before the release of the iPad. It also shows a curved computer monitor and keyboard, which seem to float above the desk.\nThe title text refers to the conflict between teenagers and adults over music and culture, with teenagers often listening to music which annoys their parents. \'Easter egg\' is a term used to describe a hidden inside joke or feature inside software. Here, the daughter has been treated like a piece of software by her father Cueball. He states that since the kids on purpose chooses music and culture that they know annoys their parents, it is a fair retaliation to build in such Easter egg responses. Many people would probably disagree on this, but maybe not so much parents with teenagers at home...\n\n
