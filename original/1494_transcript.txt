n\nCueball in this comic, as is often the case, is some sort of programmer or at least logically minded person. He reads through the terms that are handed to him, and finds some sort of loophole. This is a play on the fact that programmers often find loopholes in programs and code, and exploiting them is nothing more than a "cool find" or an interesting idea. More importantly, programmers try to prevent loopholes, which is why it is important to be able to identify them.\nThe insurance agent foresees this, and explains that this "cool hack" is actually just an instance of insurance fraud, which is highly illegal. The comparison here is that exploiting a program\'s faults can be regarded as interesting or fun, while exploiting the faults in a legal document will often result in some sort of legal repercussions (however, sometimes legal loopholes are exploited by individuals or corporations in ways that are not illegal).\nThe insurance agent is also already prepared for the following question - how he knew Cueball would be looking for loopholes, and it\'s because many programmers visit him.\nThe title text provides another example: While airport luggage security certainly is exploitable, walking out with every piece of luggage from the conveyor belt would be easily noticeable and would result in being arrested for theft.\nThis relates to 1469: UV\n\n
