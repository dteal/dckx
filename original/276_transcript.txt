n\nFixed width or monospaced font refers to the font used in old teletype terminals and instant messaging clients (often Courier).\nFor two text lines to have the same length it\'s easier if they are in a monospaced font. For example, the following sentences are almost the same length, but since we are using a proportional font those lengths are not exact (the first line is a couple of pixels wider):\n\n\n&lt;emily&gt; the best I\'ve had\n&lt;rob&gt; it was AMAZING\n\n\nThe title is possibly a double reference, both to a monospaced font and to lines of the same length.\nInitially, by mere chance, Emily\'s and Rob\'s lines were exactly the same length. This made Rob want to continue the pattern.\nThat Rob feels forced to change what he wants to type to continue the pattern could be a symptom of obsessive\xe2\x80\x93compulsive disorder.\nBecause of the monospaced font, any reply with 19 characters (including space) would have continued the pattern. In particular, "definitely for real" would have worked.\nThe title text is a reference to the line "I wish I knew how to quit you" from the movie Brokeback Mountain.\n\n
