n\nWe see Cueball declare his love for Megan in an oft-used setting, paying homage to similar events in classic literature, notably the "balcony scene" from William Shakespeare\'s play Romeo and Juliet, and a similar situation in Cyrano de Bergerac. In the former, Romeo, attempting to woo Juliet, stands beneath her balcony to profess his love for her. In the latter, an inarticulate cadet, Christian, professes his love for Roxane by arranging to use the words of a fellow soldier, Cyrano, who secretly also loves Roxane.\nThe 1989 movie "Say Anything..." contains a modern interpretation of this declaration of love, where John Cusack plays Peter Gabriel\'s "In Your Eyes" on a boombox outside the house of the girl he likes.\nCueball is holding up a boombox (a self-contained semiportable stereo system, typically with cassette tape or CD player, and complete with integrated large speakers; extreme specimens could weigh up to 12&#160;kg) which is playing music while Cueball declares his love for Megan. She first is startled, embarrassed, then eventually disgusted by the 1990 hit single Ice Ice Baby (Video) by Vanilla Ice playing on the boombox. Cueball then admits he is "not good at this," attempting to recreate the classic romantic scene, but utterly failing to play music suitable for such an event.\nThe "Under Pressure" reference in the title text refers to the fact that the music used in "Ice Ice Baby" is a sample of the bassline of "Under Pressure" by Queen and David Bowie. It also may be that Cueball is having trouble holding the boombox, hence Cueball being \'under pressure.\'\nThese two songs are again referenced together in 1561: Water Phase Diagram.\n\n
