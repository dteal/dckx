n\nScribblenauts is a game for Nintendo DS in which the player controls a character named Maxwell, whose goal is to get a "Starite" in each level. The player has the ability to summon over 22,000 different objects into the game by typing them on the touchscreen using the DS\'s stylus device. Those items are then ostensibly used to help Maxwell collect the Starite (for example, typing "ladder" to help him reach a Starite that\'s inside a tree), but the player can decide to forgo the objective and just type in random things for fun.\nThe Large Hadron Collider is the world\'s largest and highest-energy particle accelerator, and has excited the imagination of writers and journalists in popular culture, some of whom posit the theory that a catastrophic accident at the LHC could destroy the world. One of those ideas concerned the LHC creating a black hole that would proceed to suck in all the surrounding matter.\nMegan discovers that the LHC can be summoned in Scribblenauts, and has a fun time creating black holes with it. Cueball\'s snide comment is an unfortunately rather common reaction among adults towards entertainment geared for children, and the fact that Scribblenauts is a portable game just gives him another stick to beat it with.  Irritated, Megan types in the phrase "pretentious asshole", and then pretends that Cueball has suddenly appeared right there in front of her, as though summoned in the game. Note that, in reality, Scribblenauts doesn\'t respond to profanity.\nIn the title text, she types "guy who\'s just jealous that I beat all his Mario Kart times" (this could be a reference to 423: Finish Line and 290: Fucking Blue Shells) and once again, Cueball "appears" right in front of her. Mario Kart is another video-game series geared towards children, and there\'s a version of it for the DS, which implies that Cueball\'s just being snooty about Scribblenauts because Megan has so thoroughly dominated him in another "DS kids game".\n\n
