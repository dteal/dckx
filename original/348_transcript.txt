The actual first verse goes like this:\n\nWhy do birds suddenly appear\nEvery time you are near?\nJust like me, they long to be\nClose to you\n\nIn this parody, the reason birds suddenly appear whenever the girl is near is because the girl is a zombie, and those are turkey vultures, carrion birds that prey on the flesh of dead bodies. \nThe title text is joking about couples not discussing their relationship before their wedding, as is seen here\n\n
