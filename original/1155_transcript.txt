n\nAndrey Kolmogorov was a mathematician who worked, among other things, on defining computational complexity. Roughly speaking, the Kolmogorov complexity of a string (of bits, words, symbols, etc.) is the shortest description that allows an accurate reconstruction \xe2\x80\x94 or, in some variants, the length of the smallest program which will output the original string.\nCueball\'s method of giving directions is very reminiscent of Kolmogorov\'s method of determining complexity. These directions may have minimal Kolmogorov complexity, but they are non-intuitive and are likely not the shortest or quickest way to get there, considering that they consist mostly of left turns.\nThis is not the first time Cueball has had difficulties with directions, and here we see he hates giving directions as much as he hates receiving them.\nThe joke in the title text is that Cueball just sent his friend to a GPS store to buy a device to give him the correct directions.\n\n
