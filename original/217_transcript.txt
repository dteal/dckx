n\ne is a mathematical constant roughly equal to 2.71828182846. \xcf\x80 is another, roughly equal to 3.14159265359. Both are transcendental numbers.\nThe first panel discusses e\xcf\x80 - \xcf\x80, which is around 19.999099979 \xe2\x80\x94 very close to 20.  Black Hat explains how he tricked a programming team into believing that e\xcf\x80 - \xcf\x80 is close enough to 20 that the computer should be unable to tell the difference, and that any noticeable deviation from 20 results from errors in the code. This made them waste a lot of time trying to find a nonexistent bug until they realized that Black Hat was lying (clearly they had not known him for very long).\nFloating point numbers are how computers store non-integer real numbers as decimals \xe2\x80\x94 or rather, in most cases, approximate them: infinite amounts of data would be required to represent most numbers in decimal form (exceptions are whole numbers and terminating decimals). The "floating-point handlers" would be the code performing the e\xcf\x80 - \xcf\x80 calculation.\nACM is the Association for Computing Machinery, sponsoring the International Collegiate Programming Contest.\nSome random facts about the math here:\n\n e\xcf\x80 - \xcf\x80 is an irrational number, but this is not a trivial fact. It was proven by Yuri Valentinovich Nesterenko in the late 20th century.\n The mysterious almost-equation is believed to be a mathematical coincidence, or a numerical relationship that "just happens" with no satisfactory explanation. It can be rearranged to (\xcf\x80 + 20)i \xe2\x89\x88 -1, so cos(ln(\xcf\x80 + 20)) \xe2\x89\x88 -1. Piling on a few more cosines gives cos(\xcf\x80 cos(\xcf\x80 cos(ln(\xcf\x80 + 20)))) \xe2\x89\x88 -1, which is off by less than 10\xe2\x88\x9235!\n\nThe title text pokes fun at another coincidence: \xe2\x88\x9c(9\xc2\xb2 + 19\xc2\xb2/22) \xe2\x89\x88 3.1415926525, close to \xcf\x80 (deviating only in the 9th decimal place). The humor comes from the fact that \xcf\x80 is transcendental. Transcendental numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed through basic arithmetic with integers; one cannot end up with the exact value for any transcendental number (including \xcf\x80) by adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, exponentiating and/or taking the nth root of any whole number, meaning the title text cannot possibly be true.\nA much later comic, 1047: Approximations, puts forth quite a few more mathematical coincidences.\n\n
