n\nThe saying "you catch more flies with honey than vinegar" means that people are more likely to be won over with politeness than hostility.\nWhen Cueball\'s friend tells him this after he replies to a "noob" using swear words, he then says that the saying is literally false by saying that balsamic vinegar attracts more flies than honey. He then tells his friend to try it with his own fruit flies. Fruit flies are attracted to the products of fermentation, particularly to alcohol and ethanoic acid. The acidity in vinegar is due mostly to ethanoic acid. \nWhen Cueball\'s statement is found true, as balsamic vinegar smells like sweet and decomposing fruit to the fruit flies, his friend complains to his mother (with a vitriol influenced by Cueball, perhaps to get some favor) that she lied to him. He then says that another saying, "a watched pot never boils", is also literally false. That saying means that an event that is monitored with impatient attention will seem to take longer.\nIn the title text it seems that Randall explains why he wrote this comic \xe2\x80\x94 his vinegar bowl attracted a lot of fruit flies. However, he has not done the experiment with houseflies.\nThe notion of a watched pot not boiling is ascribed to Benjamin Franklin under the pseudonym "Poor Richard". He writes "a watched pot is slow to boil", meaning "Time feels longer when you\'re waiting for something to happen."[1]\n\n
