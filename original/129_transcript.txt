n\nThis comic is a commentary on HDCP, a media standard which requires all the devices from player to cable to display to be "approved" to carry HDCP content. HDCP is intended to protect media encrypted with DRM from being intercepted between the player and the display. Interestingly, however, it is literally impossible for DRM advocates to completely prevent copying (even with such drastic measures) because of the analog hole: since the content must be shown in a human-perceptible form, it can be captured by analog means, such as recording the display with a video camera.\nIn addition to illustrating the absurdity of HDCP, the comic presents the darker idea that when your devices control what information you are exposed to, the controlling companies can act as "thought police" and ensure that your mind only contains "approved content".\nWith the title text Randall is referring again to DRM. The Free Culture movement (Lawrence Lessig being one of their activists) is fighting for free content. DRM advocates claim that their technology "protects" artists by preventing piracy, while in reality DRM is more effective as a means of giving media companies control over devices than it is at preventing piracy.\n\n
