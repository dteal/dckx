n\nThe script begins similarly to the poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas":\n\n\'Twas the night before Christmas, when all thro\' the house\nNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;\n\nThe idea is that Cueball has been so used to being on the computer late at night (perhaps coding, or deep into some Internet argument) that, when Santa Claus arrives, Cueball is still awake. Note the mouse pun.\nBeing forced to sleep at normal times is compared with jet lag: Sleeplessness due to your body being synchronized to another time zone, so named because jet aircraft made it possible for people to travel farther and faster. Here Cueball needs to turn back his internal clock over five hours to sync with his family.\n\n
