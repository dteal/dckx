n\nRandall is attempting to apply mathematics to the concept of love to no avail. Specifically, he is attempting his "normal approach" which is a term used in mathematics for the method one typically uses to solve a certain type of problem. However, as love is not a well-defined mathematical entity, his normal approach is useless. Simply put: he\'s saying he has found no way of describing love using only the tools of mathematics.\nFrom the top, moving left to right, he tries the square root of love, the cosine of love, and the derivative of love with respect to x. He then attempts to left-multiply love by a 2x2 identity matrix, and finally he defines a function of love as a Fourier transform. These are all "normal approaches" to solving certain math problems.\nThe message of the comic is that for someone who uses math to solve all their problems, defining love is impossible.  It also indicates that love is not always a rational phenomenon.\nThis comic has been made into a t-shirt in the xkcd store, with a Laplace transform in place of the bottom integral.\n\n
