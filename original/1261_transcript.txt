n\nVisiting a club, Megan is exhorted by a phrase used in several songs, to "shake what your mama gave you", a crude euphemism typically used to encourage shaking one\'s body parts, referring to any of the sexually appealing anatomical parts of the dancer. Taking this exhortation extremely literally, Megan proceeds to locate a mug presumably given to her by her "mama" labeled "World\'s greatest daughter" and shakes it.\nThe phrase "shake what your mama gave ya" was in use as early as 1992, when it was the title of a song by Poison Clan, a southern hip-hop group that was influential from 1990\xe2\x80\x931995. Another version by Stik-E &amp; Da Hoodz was released in 1995 by Phat Wax records. The line gained a wider audience when it was sampled by Fatboy Slim in the similarly titled "Ya Mama" on his 2000 album Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars. More recently the line was featured in the Lil Jon single "Stick That Thang Out". In fitting with the general thematic composition of such a song, a large part of which revolves around either goading a woman to, or describing one who is dancing seductively in a nightclub - this line asks a girl to dance, thereby swaying her hips &amp; buttocks, or breasts, the most common male \'fetishes\' - making them more conspicuous in the usually dim ambiance because of the phase lag with the rest of the body, which may be attributed to non-rigidity of the elastic structures - for purposes of her male audience\'s gratification (whether it be solicited or voyeuristic).\nThe title text refers to another lyrical cliche, "work it", which typically refers to "working" one\'s body; again, generally seductively. The action may be considered work either from the point of mechanical work, or as a reference to a professional dancer. This naturally leads Megan to further confusion (as indicated by the title text) when taken literally, as she responds "it\'s already working!" It is not entirely clear if she is again referring to the mug, or simply another generic object not displayed in the comic.\n\n
