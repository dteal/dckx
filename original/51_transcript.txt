n\nThis comic humorously considers pox parties as a means of preventing malaria. In these "parties" adults bring their children to deliberately expose them to a communicable disease to promote immunity. This is commonly done for a childhood disease like chickenpox and measles.\nIn this comic, we see four Cueball-like children in party hats with a balloon lying on the ground, suggesting a missing "celebrant".\nSome illnesses are more serious for adults than children. For example, chickenpox is far less severe than its adult onset form shingles, and after contracting chickenpox the immune system has developed antibodies, reducing vulnerability to the virus. The antibodies create immunity for a significant period of time, possibly life. However, there are no antibodies created after exposure to malaria. Contrarily, once one has suffered from malaria, it can recur on its own even after apparent healing from symptoms. Thus, having a malaria party would not promote immunity as many could suffer significant illness and die.\n\n
