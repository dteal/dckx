n\nThis comic presents a series of images depicting a female gnome who is known as "Gnome Ann". The humor derives from the fact that the name "Gnome Ann" is a mondegreen of the phrase "no man". (Users of the Gnome desktop system may have difficulties understanding this since they pronounce Gnome with a hard "g", reflecting its GNU ties.)\nRandall presents the reader with six images (and a title text) captioned with quotations from a wide range of sources, each featuring an instance of the compound noun "no man" being replaced by "Gnome Ann" (and featuring a drawing that reflects this change). There is one proverb, two Biblical quotations, one literary quotation from Cervantes\' Don Quixote, one cinematic reference from the Lord of the Rings (film series) (the line \xc3\x89owyn said to the Witch-king of Angmar before killing him), one quotation from the opening of a television show (Star Trek: The Original Series), and a quotation from a piece of historical rhetoric in the title text.\n\n
