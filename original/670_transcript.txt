n\nThis comic is in reference to the 1984 mock documentary This Is Spinal Tap about the tour of the fictional rock band Spinal Tap. Here we see lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (a character portrayed in the movie by Christopher Guest) explaining to Cueball how the volume dial on his amp goes all the way to eleven. This is impressive to Nigel since guitar amplifiers generally only go to ten. This leads him to believe his amp is "one" louder than other amplifiers.\nIn reality, the loudness of an amplifier is largely dependent on how much power it has.  The highest mark on the volume dial could just as easily be labelled \'Maximum\', which would then accurately describe the meaning of that setting.\nThe normal guy knows intuitively that using eleven is silly, and wants to know what is wrong with the usual way of numbering from one to ten -- the question that is raised in the original film.\nThe engineer is desperate to explain to Nigel the fallacy in his thinking, but his jargon just sends Nigel to sleep.  He remains unenlightened.\nThe smart engineer sees an opportunity: it doesn\'t cost any more to number the volume dial differently, but Nigel places a real value on higher numbers.  The smart engineer offers to sell him an amp that goes to twelve, but at a hefty premium. \nThe title text further plays on the fact that the amp\'s levels are on an arbitrary scale. Many products are sold at a certain price per unit weight, volume, etc. (e.g., $2.99/lb for grapes). Nigel calculates that the $2000 amp would cost less than $200 per "something", but he is unable to articulate what the "something" is, confirming the third panel observation of the normal engineer. However, he decides that it\'s a good deal anyway, and it looks like the smart engineer has made a sale.\n\n
