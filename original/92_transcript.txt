n\nThis comic is about the desire for an intimate connection with another, and the compromises we make to not be alone.\nMuch like the 4am Project, Hairy finds a certain beauty in the way the world looks without billions of humans crawling around on it. He thinks of this as a secret place which thrills him. He is excited about the remote chance of finding someone like him who appreciates its beauty. But he realizes that it\'s the very thing that makes this time beautiful to him, which makes his imagined chance encounter exceedingly unlikely. Reconciled to the fact that he will not find a kindred spirit outside this morning he heads back home.\nAt the house he gets ready, and drives to a club to meet people. The club is drawn using an inverted color scheme (white people black background) to emphasize that it is the opposite of the 4am outside world. The club is dark and full of people, who are the lightest things present, where outside the natural beauty shines with out interruption by human forms. Hairy embraces this and joins the party.\nThe title text is a reference to a common music video scene (sometimes country music videos) where people play the guitar on parking garages as the sun rises.\n\n
