n\nThis comic relates to the song "Mickey", performed in 1982 by one-hit-wonder Toni Basil. The lyrics as well as the instrumentation of the song were in fact rather simple, being a perfect example of bubblegum pop in the early 1980s.\nIn the comic, however, the song is introduced as a musical masterpiece. Cueball points out the opening sequence to his friend and states that it should be considered art. When the chorus sets in and the song unfolds its lyrical brilliancy, his friend has no other comment to make except that there must be something wrong with Cueball.\nCueballs actions might be seen as a critical approach towards over-interpreting music. The comic\'s title as well as the stereo setup depicted could perhaps also denote a sidesweep on audiophiles.\nThe title text parodies a line from the song and links it with the incomprehension of Cueball\'s friend.\n\n
