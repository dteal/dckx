n\nThis comic is a take on the traditional appearance of a super hero when a disaster strikes. In this case, Etymology-Man arrives, who apparently has the power of Etymology \xe2\x80\x94 the study of the history of words, their origins, and how their form and meaning have changed over time. As Etymology-Man is explaining the history of the words "tsunami" and "tidal wave", the water starts rising around them. As the waters continue to rise, he continues to only explain the words, rather than attempting to save them as a superhero should.\nAlso, the title text is a play on how useless Aquaman is (perceived to be) compared to other superheroes, as his powers \xe2\x80\x94 breathing underwater, speed swimming, and communicating with sea life \xe2\x80\x94 are very difficult for writers to make relevant. Indeed, in the case of a flood, Aquaman and his aquatic allies would be able to assist with evacuations.\nThe irony of the situation comes from the fact that Etymology-Man also has the power of flight and could in fact save Cueball and Ponytail if he was not so busy talking about the origin of the word "tidal wave".\nEtymology-man returns two comics later in 1012: Wrong Superhero.\n\n
