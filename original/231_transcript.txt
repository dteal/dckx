n\nThis comic refers to the use of "baby talk" when speaking to pets, especially cats. A person\'s voice becomes falsetto and cooing, vocabulary becomes simplified, and phrases are repeated, such as "Here, kitty, kitty, kitty". \nThe chart shows that a person\'s apparent intelligence decreases, and that the inanity (i.e. uselessness or emptiness) of their statements increases, the closer they get to a cat.\nMost people act like this when they\'re playing with cats or trying to call it over to them.\nThankfully being close to a cat doesn\'t actually cause any decrease of intelligence in normal circumstances; the graph technically refers to demonstrated intelligence rather than actual IQ levels.\nThe title text continues Cueball\'s obvious statement (and thus inane/useless point made) from below the graph.\nIn 1535: Words for Pets Randall again mentions how people often talk strangely to their pets.\n\n
