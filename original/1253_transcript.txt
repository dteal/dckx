n\nOn the 14th August 2013, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) issued a document about public naming of astronomical objects. It stated, "IAU fully supports the involvement of the general public, whether directly or through an independent organized vote, in the naming of planetary satellites, newly discovered planets, and their host stars."\nThe text above the image states the fact above and then notes that the IAU immediately regret this decision. As we can see from Cueball\'s question and from Ponytail\'s facepalm and the fact that even Megan is speechless the suggestions are appalling. It becomes even worse when Hairbun tells them that an automatic filter has already been applied to the results, one designed to remove inappropriate entries that don\'t meet certain criteria. This implies that the list would have been even worse if presented in its unfiltered form (as seen below in the table).\nThe naming document also contained, amongst other things, guidelines that suggested names should meet. These include stipulations such as "16 characters or less", "preferably one word", being "pronounceable (in as many languages as possible)", "not too similar to an existing name of an astronomical object", avoiding commercial names, and being "respectful of intellectual property". If we go down the list, we can see that many of Randall\'s suggestions do indeed violate the guidelines. Which is part of the joke as it reflects the tendency of internet submissions to ignore such softly suggested guidelines.\nThe randomness and inappropriateness of the suggested names reflects the commonly expected response from anonymous submitters on the internet. Many forums and contests that call for online response and do not apply strict control over the responses receive similar collections of random, inappropriate and obscure submissions that are often only tangentially related to the original subject. For example, Greenpeace held a naming contest for one of the whales recently tagged in their research and preservation campaign and even after selecting the finalists the online voting resulted in naming the whale "Mr. Splashypants". PepsiCo had even less restrictive controls in their marketing campaign that asked the internet to name a new flavour of Mountain Dew. They had to shut down the contest in order to avoid naming the new beverage "Hitler did nothing wrong" which was the current leader at the time and only marginally the most inappropriate of the top ten voted suggestions. Even more recently is the case of Boaty McBoatface, in which the internet decided to dub a British research vessel "Boaty McBoatface". The boast was given the name RRS Sir David Attenborough in the end, with its Autonomous Underwater Vehicle being called "Boaty McBoatface.\nThe document also states that naming suggestions may be sent to the email that Randall included in the title text.\nThis comic was updated in 1555: Exoplanet Names 2.\n\n\n\n Star \n Planet \n Suggested Name \n Explanation\n\n\n Gliese 667 \n b \n Space Planet \n A very unoriginal name; every planet is in space.\n\n\nc \n PILF \n Pun of MILF, i.e. Planet I\'d Like to Fuck.

A* (pronounced "A star") is already used in in astronomy, for example the Milky Way\'s black hole core is Sagittarius A*. "A star" is also the name for the character asterisk and the name of the popular A* search algorithm in computer science.\n\n\ne \n e\'); DROP TABLE PLANETS;-- \n A reference to SQL injection, riffing off of comic 327, which featured a schoolboy named Robert\'); DROP TABLE students;--.  The idea here is that the IAU would enter the name into their system and promptly lose all of their data pertaining to planets.  Note that Planet e is located in the habitable zone of the star system.\n\n\nf \n Blogosphere \n Weird blog-related terms are a recurring theme in xkcd.
