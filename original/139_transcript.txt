n\nRandall likes electric skateboards (he has owned two already by the time of this comic) and this comic is just showing a simple move where Cueball drives one from A to B. \nIt\'s not very artistic but the "chicks" are cheering; and the comic states that this is how they work. The humor of the comic is an understated joke that if you use an electric skateboard just to get around, by the time you get to where you are going, there will already be a group of chicks cheering and following you just because electric skateboards are awesome.  (The pickup artist in 1178: Pickup Artists would be disappointed to learn that this is not actually accurate, as it would save him the bother of "sleazy" social manipulation of the desired "chicks", assuming they can afford to acquire an electric skateboard instead.)\nIn the title text Randall tells us that both of his two electric skateboards were cheap and have been worn down by heavy use. If he ever moves to a (the) city he will buy a really nice skateboard. If it is to be able to get around over the shorter distances of the city or if it is just because there are many more "chicks" to impress is left up to the readers imagination.\nElectric skateboards have been the subject of several other comics, but this was the first. It has been featured most prominently in The Race, a five part comic series.\n\n
