n\nThis is the sixth comic at the My Hobby series. Cueball is deliberately mispronouncing words while talking. It\'s just his hobby. Hobbies in the My Hobby series are generally annoying or weird, but with an element of cleverness. Here, Cueball persists in mispronouncing his words despite the second character\'s attempt to correct him.\nIn the title text, Randall explains that he got the idea for this comic from one of his friends.\nInterestingly, when Randall started the xkcd blog in October 2006, 6 weeks after the publication of this comic, he named it "Blag", and has used that name in several other comics, such as 181: Interblag and 239: Blagofaire.\n\n
