n\nGoto is a construct found in many computer languages that causes control flow to go from one place in program to another, without returning. Once common in computer programming, its popularity diminished in the 1960s and 1970s as focus on structured programming became the norm. Edsger W. Dijkstra\'s article "Go To Statement Considered Harmful" in particular contributed to the decline of goto.\nOften people learning programming are told goto is bad and should be avoided, but frequently are not given a reason. In this case, Cueball can see no harm in using goto to avoid rewriting much of his program. As a result, he is attacked by a velociraptor. Velociraptor attacks are a running joke (and fear) often expressed in xkcd. The humor derives from the fact that a velociraptor attack is an unexpected and severe consequence of using a goto statement.\nThe title text refers to Neal Stephenson, an author of cyberpunk novels. A label is used in many programming languages to refer to a point in a program that a goto instruction can jump to. The joke is that one of Stephenson\'s characters in Cryptonomicon is named Goto Dengo... when said out loud, "Dengo" sounds like "Then go".\n\n
