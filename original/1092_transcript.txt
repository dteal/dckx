n\nMichael Phelps is an American Olympic swimmer, who could easily be considered the best swimmer worldwide: he is the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, with 28 medals, 23 of them gold (won in the 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016 summer Olympics). He was most dominant in the 2008 Beijing Olympics where he won gold in all of the eight events in which he competed, the record for a single games.\nThis comic is a take on the idea that, Michael Phelps being (irritatingly) fast and uncatchable in a pool, a quirky yet simple trick one might imagine to nullify his pool supremacy would be to turn the water into Jello, a gelatine product, by simply dropping a huge quantity of Jello powder in the pool.\nIn the comic, Cueball and Megan try to get rid of Michael Phelps (as if he were a common pest like an animal) who is swimming in Megan\'s pool. As they can\'t catch him since he swims too fast (and taunts them about it), Cueball resorts to the Jello trick, bringing big boxes of Jello powder, to stop and catch him.\nHowever, according to the title text, after having waited the time necessary for the water to solidify, Cueball realizes that Phelps has eaten all of the resulting Jello. This may be a reference to Phelps being used to eating impressive food quantities (about 12,000 calories daily), to keep up with his strenuous exercise regimen;[1] or it may be a reference to pictures of Phelps smoking from a bong that arose after the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China, as Marijuana use is often associated with an increased appetite. Otherwise, the text may simply be a reference to Phelps being capable of achieving super-human feats, such as devouring an entire pool full of Jello.\n\n
