n\nIt looks like Randall has been playing with his Apple device after installing the recently released iOS 8 update. The comic is referencing the autocomplete function on the iOS virtual keyboard (aka leopard). A comparable feature is also available on other operating systems, like Android. When the phrase, for example, "Revenge is a dish best served" is typed, the keyboard will suggest \xe2\x80\x9cby\xe2\x80\x9d followed by \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9cgroup\xe2\x80\x9d and so on.\nThe top of the comic, where the keyboard is shown, is a reference to the character Sherlock Holmes, a detective whose most famous line is "Elementary, my dear Watson." In Randall\'s typing history, the word "dear" is most often followed by "lord" "friend" or "friends," and thus the phone suggests those words as a likely continuation of the line.\nThe title text continues, by showing more actual results from keyboard predictions from other movie quotes.\nThe following movies are referenced in the comic and title text:\n\n\n\nMovie\n\nCharacter &amp; Situation\n\nFull Quote\n\n\n\nScarface (1983)\n\nScarface is holding an M16, defending his house from Sosa\'s gunmen, shouting to attackers.\n\n"You wanna fuck with me? Okay. You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!"\n\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\nDorothy with her dog, Toto, in munchkin land.\n\n"Toto, I\'ve a feeling we\'re not in Kansas anymore."\n\n\nJames Bond\n\nBond introducing himself, while holding trademark martini.\n\n"Bond, James Bond." (nothing follows).\n\n\nSerenity (2005)\n\nWash, at the controls of Serenity.\n\n"I am a leaf on the wind - watch how I soar."\n\n\nThe Goonies (1985)\n\nMikey standing at the pool in the wishing well, encouraging his troop of misfits to continue on their journey.\n\n"Goonies never say die!"\n\n\nThe Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\n\nAragorn, Legolas &amp; Gimli pledge allegiance to protect the ring bearer on their mission to destroy the ring.\n\nAragorn: "If by my life or death I can protect you, I will. You have my sword." Legolas: "And you have my bow." Gimli: "And *my* axe."\n\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987)\n\nInigo Montoya facing the six fingered man, the man he swore a vendetta against for killing his father.\n\n"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."\n\n\nStar Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)\n\nKhan paraphrasing Shakespeare to justify his vengeance.\n\n"Revenge is a dish best served cold" (e.g. Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982): Khan: "...do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?") The quote is not originally from Star Trek but was used already in 1967 in Death Rides a Horse but it is likely that it is the Star Trek reference that is best known to Randall as it is also referenced as a Kligong proverb in Kill Bill: Volume 1.\n\n\nBraveheart (1995)\n\nWallace rallying his Scottish army before a seemingly hopeless battle against the English.\n\n"They may take our lives, but they\'ll never take... OUR FREEDOM!"\n\nAn older comic 1068: Swiftkey is also about keyboard predictions, but without any preceding text (by the Swiftkey keyboard application instead of the iOS 8 keyboard).\n\n
