n\nThe poster on the wall is the album artwork for Pink Floyd\'s album The Dark Side of the Moon. It shows a beam of light passing through a dispersive prism and separating into a rainbow. After thinking a bit, the new student makes a poster that uses a lens to reverse the rainbow into another prism. This idea actually isn\'t very innovative, because the original backside of the album contained the reverse rainbow and prism (but not the lens).\nIn the title text, the words "Pink FTFY" (Fixed That For You) would come immediately after Pink Floyd alphabetically, but Randall seems to believe no one would see it, because supposedly no one visits record stores any more now that music can be bought and downloaded online.\n\n
