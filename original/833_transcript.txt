n\nThis comic is a typical xkcd compilation. Relationships, math, graphs and of course, the twist. At 523: Decline Cueball\'s fascination with graphs seems to have retaliated against him. Cueball wants to get back together with Megan, but she declines and shows him a graph showing why. She thinks that the downward trend of the graph will convince him that their relationship is also in decline. But, Cueball takes that as this is a girl who does not follow proper protocol, since she does not label the axes (plural for axis) on her graph. We do not even know the unit of measure on the graph, let alone what each axis corresponds to. For all we know, the horizontal axis could be labeled "Time" and the vertical axis could be labeled "Crappiness of Relationship" or "Unawesomeness of Relationship". In that case, a downward trend would be a positive thing.\nIn the twist, Cueball sees that he can do better than this girl and switches his position and decides he is going to break up with her.\nThe title text points out the irony that if the axes had been labelled, then Cueball would be able to use it to determine exactly how much better a relationship he could get, since he could read how crappy the present one is. Yet he would lose the twist at the end, so that the graph data would have to convince him and not the lack of labels.\n\n
