n\nMany airlines give passengers the opportunity to select a preferred seat when booking a flight. In this case, Megan appears to be checking in at a at self-check-in at the airport where she is given the opportunity to select her seat. Rather than selecting a seat on the diagram, Megan clicks on the pilot seat (which is of course not an actual option for  online seating reservations&#91;citation needed&#93;). In the last frame, we see that because she chose the pilot seat she is now actually sitting in the captains seat flying the plane while whooping. A worried looking pilot sits behind her at the back of the cockpit holding both hands in front of his mouth.\nThe title text says to not click on the wing. The implication is that if you did click on the wing you would similarly end up sitting outside on the wing. Even if you were able to hold on, this would put you above the Death Zone which is at 7 km (See the what if? Rising Steadily). Standard cruising altitude is 10 km.. It will be an unpleasant death as the air is so thin that you actually lose oxygen to the air (as explained in the mentioned what if?)\nThis kind of event could lead to situations as the one depicted in 1660: Captain Speaking.\n\n
