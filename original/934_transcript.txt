n\nThis comic is a parody of the "Get a Mac" (also known as "I\'m a Mac" or "Mac vs. PC") ad campaign for the Mac brand of computers. The ads personified the Mac and their competitors, the PC. The ads poked fun at the PC\'s terrible function while paying attention to the Mac\'s unique features. Each ad started with the duo introducing themselves as "I\'m a Mac..." "...and I\'m a PC."\nThe comic, however, presents the differences between them as no longer of much importance, since most everything nowadays is done through browsers due to the proliferation of cloud computing. In essence, using the same browser to visit the same website among different operating systems would give you an experience that is very much the same. Additionally, there is some self-referential humor here; both the Mac and PC are simple stick figures due to xkcd\'s style. Therefore, they are literally identical as far as appearance goes.\nThe title text refers to window management, which is software that controls windows on computers. xmonad is one such program, and Randall says that eventually it will be an extension usable with the browser Firefox. What makes it somewhat unusual (and thus worth mentioning) is that it is a tiling window manager, meaning it automatically arranges and resizes newly opened program windows to fit a grid. This is especially useful on large screens.\n\n
