n\nEveryone has had moments where they forget someone\'s name, even the name of someone pretty important. This doesn\'t often happen with one\'s own significant other, however; hence the joke.\nIt\'s sometimes tricky to say the right things during an introduction, and while making sure you don\'t make an incorrect response (replying to the question "How\'re you doing?" with "Not much", for example, mishearing the question as "What are you doing?"), one can sometimes forget to pay attention to the actual important part of the introduction: The person\'s name. And it\'s awkward to ask someone for their name when you should, by all rights, already know it.\nForgetting people\'s names is a frequent symptom of various social anxiety disorders, but it can happen to anybody at any time.\n\n
