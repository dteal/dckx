n\nGeoIP is a service that converts IP addresses to their respective location on the Earth. This is done by looking up the IP address in a database maintained by various internet service providers. Advertisers often take advantage of the Joneses effect by creating localized ads which misleadingly appear to be specific to your location, but are often simply stock photographs with the name of the nearest town superimposed on top.\nThe comic satirizes this phenomenon. The International Space Station (ISS) has a high speed data downlink, but no direct connection to the internet. But here, Cueball trolls the advertisers from on board the ISS, by inserting his actual location on low Earth orbit into the database under that IP address. He proudly present his result to Ponytail where the advertisements claim that there are "local girls" in low Earth orbit; a distance of roughly 420 kilometers above the Earth surface, and thus at least that far away from all other girls in the world if they are not on the space station. \nThe title text shows GeoIP has become so accurate that it can now pinpoint the user\'s location to his Mom\'s basement. In United States, an adult living with his/her parents is termed shameful for that person, since it means that the adult does not have a job and cannot support himself. The ads are typically of the form -- "Meet hot young singles in &lt;user\'s location&gt;" where the &lt;user\'s location&gt; part is filled in from GeoIP. In this case, the GeoIP is so accurate that it not just identifies that user is in his parents\' house, but it also pinpoints the location that he\'s hiding in the basement, perhaps because he does not want to be seen by people visiting his parents. Thus GeoIP is unknowingly shaming the user by reminding him that he is in his mom\'s basement, and hence the "Screw you" response.\n\n
