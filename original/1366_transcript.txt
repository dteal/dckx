n\nThis comic, which appeared the day before National Train Day, plays on the fact that a choice of a reference frame is arbitrary, leading to the "Principle of relativity" in Albert Einstein\'s theories of special relativity and general relativity. But at speeds much lower than the speed of light it also applies to the newtonian mechanics.\nRather than viewing this situation as a train causing itself to move relative to an immobile Earth, Randall provides the unconventional perspective of a train remaining fixed in space while causing the Earth itself and all the stars in the sky to rotate instead. In principle either perspective is equally valid \xe2\x80\x94 though in practice different trains often move in mutually-exclusive directions, thus each train would have to define its own frame of reference. It is said that Einstein once asked a ticket collector, "What time does Oxford stop at this train?"\nChanging the reference frame into the inside of the train only means that you see the outside world in a different reference, since the train doesn\'t really move the Earth (the train\'s engine and the friction of the wheels aren\'t even remotely powerful enough) it simply appears that way from the inside.\nFrom the Newtonian perspective this choice of frame is valid, but results in unnecessarily complicated math; the equation of motion would include terms for centrifugal, Coriolis and other so-called "fictional forces" see 123: Centrifugal Force. Newton supposes the existence of "inertial frames", in which these forces are zero, and the surface of the Earth approximates an inertial frame well. In General Relativity, the presence of mass in a system curves the spacetime around of it. The train-earth system could be modelled in general relativity, taking the train as fixed. However the resulting equations would be complex, and not amenable to an exact solution.\nThe title text expands on this to include elevators, which change a person\'s position relative to the center of the Earth. From a passenger\'s perspective, it would appear as though the Earth\'s position was instead being changed in space.\nThese examples use the train and the elevator as fixed points to define relative travel. The more common method to define movement is to use the Earth\'s surface as fixed point, but other reference points could be the Earth\'s center, the Sun, predefined "fixed" stars or the center of our galaxy. Each of these would result in a completely different movement speed:\n\nThe speed of the train (stationary on the equator) relative to the earth\'s center: 465&#160;m/s (1,674&#160;km/h or 1,040&#160;mph)\nThe speed of the train (on earth) relative to the sun: 30&#160;km/s (108,000&#160;km/h or 67,000&#160;mph)\nThe speed of the train (on earth) relative the center of our galaxy: 220&#160;km/s (828,000&#160;km/h or 514,000&#160;mph)\n\nThe train, as seen from an inertial frame, doesn\'t seem to rotate the earth, but it does in fact have a minute, immeasurable effect on the Earth\'s rotation (see what-if? 41: Go West and 162: Angular Momentum).\n\n
