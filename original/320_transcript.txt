n\nThe 28-Hour Day is a modified sleep schedule proposed to accommodate the discrepancy between the earth\'s day-night cycle and certain people\'s preferred sleep schedules. It discards the traditional notion of sleeping at night and replaces it with sleeping when it is more convenient for weekend parties and mid-week insomnia. It is also the only reasonable and consistent alternative day length which will sync with the widely accepted and practiced 168-hour week (168 = 7 * 24 = 6 * 28). Underneath the weekly timeline, Cueball describes the schedule\'s selling points to his friend, who apparently has difficulty sleeping.\nCueball\'s friend shows little interest in this idea, and instead resorts to low-quality "your mom" jokes. Cueball merely bides his time, and in the end successfully trumps the jokes with a response that impugns his friend\'s sexual stamina, leading him to concede defeat.\nThe title-text uses "Small print" to mean "Disclaimer" and relieves the idea\'s creator of any responsibility in the case that it is tried and the tester finds the schedule to be a really bad idea.\n\n
