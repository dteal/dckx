n\nThe image shows fields of human life that would be greatly improved and/or allowed a certain people to make a lot of money if some "weird phenomena" things (mostly paranormal) actually worked in reality or were testable and usable concepts. "Weird phenomena", in this case, means counter-intuitive things that usually go against "common sense" and which the science hasn\'t investigated to the full yet (or didn\'t find any evidence of in the first place, making claims completely unscientific). As the comic tries to prove, if there were commercial use for it and proofs of it working, there will be high investment made in the technology to use and harness such concepts.\nSo far, only relativity and quantum electrodynamics have found some use in the real world because they are scientific concepts, as compared to all the other ones.\nSpecifically, the theory of relativity allows your Global Positioning System (GPS) device to synchronize with satellites a hundred miles in the air and show your current position.\nThe design of modern circuit-boards and other electronic devices is influenced by quantum electrodynamics \xe2\x80\x94 smartphones or high capacity hard drives wouldn\'t be possible without that theory.\nThe non-scientific, disproved concepts trying to pass as real and scientific are as follows:\n\nRemote viewing: Alleged ability to see and know things far away with the strength of your mind, without physically being in that place and using technology (cameras, TV screens and so on).\nDowsing: Alleged supernatural ability to sense, using two dowsing rods/sticks/pieces of metal where hidden valuables or underground water/oil supplies are.\nBoth dowsing and remote viewing would have greatly cut costs to oil companies, because it would have made finding new oil sources easier.\n\n\nAuras: Non-scientific belief that every human has invisible "energy field" that can affect their health and feelings.\nHomeopathy: Non-scientific belief that the more diluted a remedy, the more effective it is, and that the remedy should, before dilution, cause similar symptoms to the disease it is said to cure. These "remedies" are often diluted so much that, on average, not even a single molecule of the original substance will remain. It is completely untrue and proven no more effective than a placebo, so one can instead use much cheaper glucose and have the same effect. It is often advertised as an "alternative medicine", which means it is not a medicine at all.\nRemote Prayer: Non-scientific belief. Trying to help a person with their health problems by praying/pleading to a greater supernatural force to help them get better. While we\'re not ones to rag on anybody\'s religion, we don\'t have scientific proof or empirical evidence of it working; such prayer may sometimes have a detrimental effect if the person knew they were prayed for.\nAll three would have revolutionized healthcare if proven to work, which is very, very unlikely.\n\n\nAstrology: Trying to predict the future by studying the motions of the planets for answers. Non-scientific and very popular belief that tries to look scientific; was a major focus of astronomy until science began to disprove it in the 1600s.\nTarot: Trying to predict the future through dealing a special deck of cards. \nBoth would have revolutionized our business planning, saving lots of money and lives, if true.\n\n\nCrystal energy: Non-scientific belief that crystals can store "soul energy" which can be tapped into and used by human beings.\nIf true and correct, it would have revolutionized the world\'s technology by replacing energy sources with crystals.\n\n\nCurses and hexes: Non-scientific belief that a person can cause supernatural harm to people and things by doing certain magical rituals and mouthing magical words.\nIf it were true, the military use of such would have proliferated rather quickly.\n\n\nThe title text points out that many people still believe in non-scientific, unproven, and disproved phenomena. Thus, it\'s possible to make a lot of money by selling those (claimed) phenomena to such people.\n\n
