n\n4\'33" is a 1952 composition by American avant-garde composer John Cage consisting of four minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence. More specifically, 4\'33" consists entirely of faint ambient sounds coming from the environment, while all the players silently hold their instruments. The noise of the audience is considered part of the composition. It is Cage\'s most famous work, and the subject of many music jokes. Note that John Cage wrote plenty of other non-silent things.\nMegan is using an app on her smartphone that analyzes music that is playing and uses an online database to figure out what it is; popular real-world examples include Shazam and SoundHound. She does this in an empty room, correctly matching 4\'33". Cueball attempted to use the same app in 1192: Humming, but Megan hacked it there.\nThe title text refers to the fact that since 4\'33" is composed of the ambient sounds in an environment, if that environment is a recording studio, the ambient sound is a band playing another song.\n\n
