n\nOn April 20, 1979, U.S. President Jimmy Carter was allegedly "attacked by a giant swimming rabbit", while solo-fishing on a boat in his hometown. The reality is a little more nuanced: According to Carter, the rabbit had actually been chased into the water by some hounds and swam near his boat. Carter splashed some water on it to compel the rabbit not to come any closer.\nNevertheless, the newspapers ate it up, reveling in the ridiculous notion that anyone would feel threatened by a rabbit (considered to be a small, harmless herbivore), with respected paper The Washington Post putting the story "President Attacked by Rabbit" on the front page. Since the White House refused to release the photograph, the paper created a cartoon parody of the rabbit, calling it PAWS, in reference to the blockbuster film JAWS, about a killer shark. Carter\'s opponents used it as fodder for their arguments that Carter\'s presidency was weak and ineffectual, and basically, the whole thing was blown way out of proportion by the American media, as so often happens with goofy events such as this.\nThis comic treats the Killer Rabbit attack as a dark day for the United States, and uses the phrase "America Must Never Forget", which usually applies to days like the Pearl Harbor attack or 9/11.  It essentially shows that, for the entire history of the United States (which starts with the signing of the Declaration of Independence), it is the only event worth remembering.\nThe rabbit incident is also referenced in 1688: Map Age Guide.\nThe title text is an assumption that the event has not been remembered in the way the comic jokes that it should have been, and as a result, younger readers will think he is kidding when he says Carter was attacked by a rabbit.\n\n
