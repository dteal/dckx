n\nThis comic is about steroid usage to enhance one\'s performance; it is likely inspired by Lance Armstrong\'s then-recent confession to blood doping in a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey (although Armstrong\'s confessions did not itself include anabolic steroid use; "steroids" is a common catch-all phrase often misused to reference other forms of doping).\nThe comic states that humans are essentially made up of chemicals, and they need other chemicals to survive \xe2\x80\x94 for example, food, water and air are made up of chemicals. Humans also have a propensity for competition to find out which person is the fastest and strongest.\nThis comic is making the point of the opinion that the criterion about which chemicals (steroids) humans may or may not take in to be considered the strongest or fastest is an artificial criterion. This is demonstrated by Megan explaining the whole concept to a non-humanoid intelligence; when framed the way Megan frames it, the explanation sounds rather trivial and silly. A better explanation would be to say that some chemicals make humans faster and stronger but also damage the human body, so these chemicals are banned so the competitors won\'t destroy themselves. Another point Megan has missed is that the competitions are regulated with rules, and competitors make an agreement to follow by these rules; taking substances banned by the rules is inherently deceitful, such deceit being a horrible violation in the eyes of fans and fellow competitors.\nThis comic is one of many instances where Randall attempts to trivialize sports.\nThe title text changes the perspective again by suggesting that humanity itself is trivial in the grand scheme of things and that really all we are is a "transition" state between old dust and new dust, with a bunch of emailing in between.\nThe comic was published on Ash Wednesday (Western liturgical start of Lent). The dust to dust reference calls to mind the charge, "Remember man that thou art dust and unto dust you shall return," which is traditionally spoken by priests as they place ashes on the foreheads of observers on Ash Wednesday, in addition to the idea that all atoms in the universe other than Hydrogen, Helium, and some Lithium, were created after the big-bang via Stellar nucleosynthesis, with further production and dispersal via Supernova nucleosynthesis. Thus the reference by Joni Mitchell in the song Woodstock (song): "We are stardust..."; and echoed by Carl Sagan: "We are star stuff."\nSimilar talking floating energy dots have been used later in 1450: AI-Box Experiment and 1747: Spider Paleontology. They are clearly not the same as in this comic.\n\n
