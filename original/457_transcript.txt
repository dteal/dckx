n\nA bra is pictured here, but instead of a traditional clasp, a Rubik\'s cube is used instead. This would lead to the frustration mentioned in the comic\'s title, as someone wishing to remove the bra would have to solve the Rubik\'s cube every time in order to undo the clasp. This would doubtless prove annoying, especially for a partner who may want to remove the wearer\'s clothing without impediment.  A normal bra clasp can be tricky enough for the inexperienced user, but the addition of the Rubik\'s Cube element is going too far. However, it is possible that this is actually a nerdsnipe bra, as it appears to be a front-clasped bra, making the Rubik\'s cube a red herring.\nThe title text is an imagined conversation between someone trying to undo this bra and someone who is likely wearing the bra. The first person explains that they can "do it" (i.e. undo the bra) in under a minute, which is a reasonably impressive skill to have if you are not a professional speedcuber. The second person replies that they\'ve noticed, a sarcastic reply that relies on the alternative, sexual meaning of "do it", implying a complaint about the first person\'s speedy performance in bed.\n\n
