n\nBlack Hat, being Black Hat, is deliberately perverting a classic physics demonstration. In the normal version of the demonstration, a heavy ball on a pendulum is pulled to one side until it is almost, but not quite, touching the demonstrator or volunteer\'s nose or chin. When the ball is released at rest, it swings down and away, then back up to (almost) the same distance in the arc from where it started \xe2\x80\x94 but never (by the laws of physics) farther than where it started. If the demonstrator or volunteer doesn\'t lean in, the heavy ball will never hit them in the nose. Thus, faith in physics means there is no reason to flinch. (Sample videos: [1], [2].)\nIn this comic, since Cueball is not standing at the beginning edge of the ball\'s movement, but rather at the base of its swing, he is about to get a rude surprise. However, judging from the "slack" of the rope, the ball should not hit Cueball in the head but would almost certainly hit him lower.\nThe title text refers to the fact when someone flinches during the pendulum experiment, they are commonly accused of not having faith in the laws of physics. Randall is rebutting this argument by stating that, rather than not having faith in science, he is actually in tune with it, specifically the biological processes that led to the flinch reflex. His eyes and his flinch reflex have been calibrated through millions of years of evolution. To instantly dismiss his body\'s natural reaction when a heavy object comes quickly towards his face does not give enough credit to these mechanisms that successfully kept him (and every one of his ancestors) alive. In other words, while flinching may indicate doubt of the laws of physics, it may equally well indicate trust in the laws of biology.\nThe idea of hitting someone else with a pendulum is also the topic of 755: Interdisciplinary.\n\n
