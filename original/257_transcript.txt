n\nCode talkers are persons who communicate using their native language not known by the enemies. The most well-known code talkers were the Navajo-speaking Marines serving during World War II.\nThis comic shows a Navajo code talker transmitting an encrypted binary file by speaking "one" and "zero" (actually "neutral", as explained in the title text) into a microphone. By using only two words the code is easily cracked. Unlike the Navajo Marines, this process does not add security because it easily can be decrypted and is also much slower than simply transmitting the file over a network.\nNote that (probably unbeknownst to Randall), the actual code used by the Navajo code talkers was not so far removed from the depiction in the comics: The Navajos used a mostly alphabetic code, with one Navajo word for each English letter. (This meant that even though the Axis captured at least one native Navajo speaker, he could not make any sense of what was said.) However, several important terms were given their own Navajo idioms, so the entropy would be somewhat higher than depicted in the comic.\nThe title text is a disclaimer from Randall about using "neutral" instead of "zero"; Navajo has words for the concept of nothing, but not for the numeral Zero.\n\n
