n\nThe adverb "literally" implies that the action it describes actually happened, while its opposite, "figuratively", is used when the action it describes is being used as a figure of speech, and is not a representation of what actually happened. However, "literally" is often used colloquially as an intensifier, to mean "really" or "very", and even though many dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster and Oxford Learner\'s Dictionaries state that this is a valid use of the word, many people object to this usage. It is note worthy that these dictionaries try to catalog how words are used, not whether any one usage is more valid than another.\nIn this comic, Cueball mentions he was literally glued to his seat, at which point a crazy man off-panel loudly corrects him. The crazy man declares that he has been stalking Cueball for eighteen years since an incident in seventh grade, where the crazy man (as a kid) uses literally in the colloquial sense and young Cueball corrects him. He felt humiliated and began to follow Cueball everywhere, waiting for Cueball to make the same mistake presumably to save face.\nWhen Cueball tells him that he is "literally the craziest person" he\'s ever met, the crazy man thinks that he is incorrectly using the word "literally" again; however, Cueball reassures him that he did not misuse it, implying the crazy man actually is the craziest person he has ever met.\nThe title text points out that a chemistry experiment gone wrong is one of the few things that could cause someone to literally be glued to their seat, having previously been figuratively glued to their seat in fascination\nIn this manner the title text could provide an alternative interpretation of Cueball\'s original sentence: "I was literally glued to my seat through the entire [chemistry experiment.]"\nIf this interpretation were correct the crazy person interrupted Cueball before he had a chance to finish his sentence, which would not have been incorrect in the literal sense, thereby never fulfilling his vow.\nThe title text of 1652: Conditionals (and partly the subject of that comic) is literally a reference to this comic, if you are not too pedantic about the details. In the title text of 1576: I Could Care Less and later in the caption of 1735: Fashion Police and Grammar Police the word literally is used again referring back to this comic..\n\n
