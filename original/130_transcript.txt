n\nJulia Stiles, who later became a well-known actress as an older teenager and adult, did in fact appear in the children\'s television show Ghostwriter as a 12-year-old in 1993. The sketch in this comic depicts Stiles as she appeared in the episode, and all the dialogue attributed to her is taken from her character\'s actual dialogue.\nAlthough this dialogue was supposed to establish Erica (Stiles\' character) as an expert on hacking, it actually consists mostly of buzzwords (some of which are fake), none of which would impress an actual computer hacker.\nThe thread in the news section of the forums, as referenced in the title text, can be found here. However, a copy of the video with better audio can be found here.\n\n
