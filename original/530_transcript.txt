n\nCueball, locked out of his dorm/apartment, is trying to get his roommate Megan\'s attention so that she\'ll unlock the door. He tries various increasingly obscure ways of contacting her: calling her cell phone, IRC, the window, and finally remotely logging into their downstairs Mac computer (via SSH) to make it shout at her, which involves working out a way to turn up the computer\'s volume. Ponytail informs him of the most obvious solution\xe2\x80\x94the doorbell\xe2\x80\x94which prompts a moment of realization.  The content of this realization\xe2\x80\x94"I\'m An Idiot"\xe2\x80\x94is stated in the title of the comic.  The humor of the comic derives from the rhythm of the panels: a long buildup followed by a short quip, then a sudden, silent pause for the implied realization moment.\nThe humor of this comic also derives from the reader\'s familiarity with the behavior shown in the comic, since most every person who likes solving problems has experienced a moment of realization similar to Cueball\'s at one point or another.  They, like Cueball, get distracted by solving an interesting problem because solving problems is fun, and fail to notice that the problem has an easier solution that they haven\'t considered.  This same issue of getting lost in a sub-problem [in this case, the-sub problem of how to remotely control text-to-speech in OS X] at the expense of overall problem-solving ability is further covered in 761: DFS.\nThe title text states that this is a true story, so Cueball must represent Randall. It also mentions that, although missing an obvious solution can be humiliating, one often learns a lot from trying new solutions, which would explain why the behavior persists.\nThis comic follows a similar storyline to 349: Success and 1518: Typical Morning Routine, as Cueball and Hairy respectively in these comics, encounters an issue and attempts proceedingly more absurd solutions to the issue. \n\n
