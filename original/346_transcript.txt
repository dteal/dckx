n\nThis comic\'s premise is a reference to the phenomenon of dropping Mentos into a bottle of a carbonate beverage to create a geyser of said beverage. During 2007, a large number of videos depicting this phenomenon floated around the Internet. \nCueball wants to show this phenomenon to his friend, because it\'s "the coolest thing". However, instead of achieving the standard result, a geyser of Diet Coke, the friend\'s father magically appears (presumably from the dead or from abandonment).\nAn alternative interpretation is that the friend\'s father is resurrected/returned in an event unrelated to the geyser, undermining the geyser\'s coolness.\nThe title text shows that Randall considers (or at least then considered) this trick to be one of the two coolest tricks you can perform with normal kitchen supplies.  The other is using corn starch and water to make a non-Newtonian fluid that reacts wildly with vibrations and impact.\n\n
