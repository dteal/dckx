n\nFortune cookies are crisp cookies containing a small piece of paper with words of wisdom or a vague prophecy. Even though they were not actually invented in China, they are commonly served as dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States.\nThere is a common joke involving fortune cookies that involves appending "in bed" \xe2\x80\x94 the phrase "in bed" being one of many sexual innuendo jokes along with "your mom", "that\'s what she said", and "said the actress to the bishop" \xe2\x80\x94 to the end of the fortune, usually creating a sexual innuendo or other bizarre messages.\n\nThe ones you love will never let you down in bed\nYour self-confidence is well placed in bed\nSeek nonviolence in everything you do in bed\n\nThis comic turns that joke around, showing how appending "except in bed" can also create even more amusing messages.\n\nThe ones you love will never let you down, except in bed\nYour self-confidence is well placed, except in bed\nSeek nonviolence in everything you do, except in bed\n\nThe title text instead shows the example of an imaginary fortune that would not change in meaning if "in bed" was appended. The meaning would, however, change considerably if except in bed was added instead. A part of the joke is that you will never find such a fortune in a cookie!\n\n
