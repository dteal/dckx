n\nThe joke here is the reverse of an old joke that appeared in rec.humor.funny. In the original, the punchline reveals that a small pianist is the result of a man\'s wish for a twelve-inch (one foot or 30.5 cm) penis which was misheard by a genie. In this version, Cueball wished for the twelve-inch pianist to a hard-of-hearing genie, with the implication that he instead received a twelve-inch penis. This piques Megan\'s interest.\nA long-debated subject in human sexuality is whether sexual activity is more pleasurable for a woman when the man has a larger penis (and therefore whether woman desire men with larger penises). Although opinions on the subject seem to vary in surveys, a common stereotype is that women prefer or even seek out men with large penises, or at very least are turned off by men with small penises. Penis size has become associated with virility and "manliness", and another common generalization is that men would choose to have the largest penis, if it were possible to choose. The punchline of the original joke plays on the fact that wishing for a tiny pianist is a very unusual, interesting and specific wish, until the punchline reveals that the subject\'s wish was far more expected.\nThe title text is implying that, since Cueball\'s wish was misheard as referencing penis size, had the piano been even smaller, it would have only needed a three-inch (7.6 cm) pianist. This would imply that Cueball\'s misheard wish would have resulted in his being given a three-inch penis, which is below average and therefore, following the same generalizations as above, is seen as undesirably small.\nGenies (or magic lamps) are mentioned in at least three other comics:\n\n152: Hamster Ball\n879: Lamp (where Randall also manages to make a penis related joke)\n1391: Darkness\n\n
