n\nThe comic references Google\'s new Project Loon, a balloon powered Internet service which was officially announced June 14, 2013 and is currently in proof-of-concept testing stages. A test above New Zealand, involving about 30 balloons and about 50 users, was successfully conducted on June 16. The project, taglined "Internet for Everyone", is intended to eventually provide Internet access to people in rural areas and in disaster areas that have limited or no access to land-based Internet services.\nRandall is poking fun at the tagline "Internet for Everyone" \xe2\x80\x94 meant to mean anyone could have Internet access regardless of location \xe2\x80\x94 by instead literally bringing the Internet to Cueball, who retired in a deserted area, away from all technology, to read a standard paper book. In the comic, one of the balloons sneaks up on Cueball before speaking and startling Cueball, effectively becoming a nuisance, interrupting Cueball\'s reading of a book and leaving Cueball wondering what has happened. In Randall\'s world, the tagline could be restated as "Internet for Everyone \xe2\x80\x94 whether they want it or not".\nThe title text describes Randall\'s own plan to provide rural internet. He will operate in a region where Verizon Wi-Fi infrastructure already exists, and take advantage of their 14-day return policy to effectively obtain internet access for free, which he will then sell under his own brand.\n\n
