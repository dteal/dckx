n\nIn this comic, each state of the United States of America has been filled-in with an object of similar shape. Due to the size range of the states, some states are too small to clearly make-out in the normal size image. Click here to see the large version, which makes every state perfectly clear. Several years later Randall made a new map of the US mainland 1653: United States Map, where he shuffled the positions of the states but filled out the outline. Also in this map Michigan has been split into two separate parts. (Here it is the glove and the eagle). \nVery few, if any, of the shapes used are stereotypes of the state; they are merely objects that look like the state. Some of the objects are those which the states are widely known to resemble. For example, Michigan is represented by a glove and an Eagle, and a pot with handle takes the place of Oklahoma (with the panhandle region of the state filled with a literal handle). Others, however, are more creative. Few would have likely pictured Texas as a dog or Alaska as a bear with a jet pack and laser gun. There are several incredibly simple objects filling some states. Kentucky is filled by a cloud, which conceivably could have been used for any state, and Wyoming, one of the nearly rectangular states, is simply an envelope. There are three pairs of states that are related. Georgia and Missouri each contain an image of the other, drawing attention to their similar shapes, North and South Dakota are the top and bottom halves of an amp, and Alabama and Mississippi are moai facing in opposite directions.)\nColorado contains what looks like a Wikipedia article. A close-up of the fake article is provided [1]. The following references are made in the Colorado article:\n\nThe pronunciation is not that for Colorado, but for Eyjafjallaj\xc3\xb6kull, a volcano in Iceland that erupted in April 2010.\nThe way it has a demilitarized zone towards Wyoming resembles North Korea and South Korea.\nEleven dimensions refers to string theory.\nA wormhole is a theoretical relative of the black hole. This is a reference to the television series Stargate SG-1 where a device capable of creating wormholes is located in the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker in Colorado.\nA Horcrux is a type of magical object in the world of Harry Potter.\nThe radiation zones around Longmont are caused by radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant.\nThe fake motto Si parare possis, vivere septem can be roughly translated as "With preparation, survival is possible for over a week."\n\nNew Mexico according to Randall\'s transcript is "A liquid container labeled for something of unusual and silly danger". The labeling is upside down and it refers to the nuclear testing facility White Sands Missile Range located in New Mexico for the nuclear bomb.\n\nThis end up\nProperty of White Sands Missile Range\n???

Obviously, this penis is somewhat flaccid (not erect). The use of the word "state" is a pun, as it means some particular condition (flaccid state) as well as a political entity (The State of Florida).\n\n
