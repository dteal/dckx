n\nThis comic represents the impacts due to climate change by demonstrating the changes in climate that should be expected with a given change in global temperature. This is done by detailing the world\'s climate in geologic periods where the global average temperature has changed by one or more "Ice Age Units," or IAU. The comic defines an IAU as the difference in global temperature between today and the last ice age, about 4.5&#160;\xc2\xb0C. An IAU of 0 represents modern global temperature.  It was later followed with a similar but much more elaborate chart in 1732: Earth Temperature Timeline.\nOne IAU unit happens to be the expected increase in global temperature the world will see by the end of year 2100. The prediction of 4-5 degrees Celsius of warming may not appear significant, but is easy to see as a substantial difference when comparing today to the last ice age. \n\n An IAU of -4 is associated with Snowball Earth. Snowball earth is a near-total freezing of the entire surface around 650 million years ago, in the Cryogenian. This may have been the greatest ice age known to have occurred on Earth.\n\n An IAU of -1 is associated with the last ice age. During this time Randall\'s neighborhood was buried under an ice sheet.\n\n An IAU of +1 is the predicted global temperature by the end of year 2100. While it makes sense to assume it\'s just as drastic a difference as -1 IAU, we still don\'t know the actual nature of what it would be, which is why it is represented by a question mark in the comic.\n\n An IAU of +2 is associated with the "Hothouse Earth" of the early Cretaceous period. At this time there were "palm trees at the poles" as there were polar forests during Cretaceous summers. (Average temperature of North Pole during the summer is 0&#160;\xc2\xb0C or 32&#160;\xc2\xb0F. 0+2*4.5 = 9&#160;\xc2\xb0C = 48.2&#160;\xc2\xb0F, hot enough for trees to grow at the North Pole under hypothetical 2 IAU scenarios)\n\nAn increase of 4.5&#160;\xc2\xb0C (+1 IAU) seems like a small change in temperature, but the changes it would cause are likely very large as it can also be described as halfway to palm trees at the poles.\nThe topic of ice coverage over various cities has previously been covered in 1225: Ice Sheets. The image of Boston from that comic is reused at the top of the huge chart in 1732: Earth Temperature Timeline.\nThis comic shows the extreme extend to which global warming can (and will) change our environment. Randall presented this view earlier in 164: Playing Devil\'s Advocate to Win. Climate change, especially global warming, is a recurring theme in xkcd and Randall is clearly convinced that we are causing it.\nThe title text expands, demonstrating that  the potential impacts of an increase by the IPCC report\'s best case scenario of 2&#160;\xc2\xb0C, about half an ice age unit, makes controlling climate change seem more urgent. The figure of 2&#160;\xc2\xb0C is the most commonly agreed temperature target that assumes the creation of aggressive emissions limits at the time of the publishing of the comic.\n\n
