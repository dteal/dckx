n\nWhen a person has been appointed to one of certain positions by the President, they must first go through a confirmation hearing in front of the Senate, the upper house of Congress where they find if the person is qualified to be in the position they have been appointed to. Of course, Black Hat is not the cleanest of characters, so Congress has a lot of reservations about his r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9.\n\nStarbucks is an American coffee shop chain.\nHe hasn\'t yet, but in 562: Parking, Black Hat will cut someone\'s car in half to make it fit in a single space. Not quite as dramatic as completely disassembling a car and, as the title text says, putting a single piece in another car parked in the lot, and building a car out of the displaced parts, which could almost be considered subtle; but, it is quite dramatic.\nTaking all the parts from different cars to build in a new car in the same spot parallels the idea in philosophy of the Ship of Theseus in which a question arises of whether a ship is the same ship if it is replaced piece by piece by identical pieces.\n\nCharles M. Schulz drew a comic called Peanuts. One of the recurring characters was Snoopy who would often use his doghouse as an imaginary Sopwith Camel in many battles with The Red Baron who piloted a Red Fokker Triplane.\nThe Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade is a parade that happens on Thanksgiving Day in the US. There are many giant balloons of pop-culture icons. Snoopy has made many appearances.\n\n9/11 Truthers believe that the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 (thus 9/11) was not actually organized by terrorists, but by the United States government. Black Hat apparently claims to subscribe to a comedically exaggerated version of this conspiracy theory in which the attacks did not happen at all and the World Trade Center is presumably still standing. Such a conspiracy is extremely implausible, as it would require either the involvement of every single person to ever set foot in one of the world\'s largest cities, or some way to conceal a pair of hundred story tall buildings.\nBlack Hat uses a common refrain Wake up, Sheeple.\n\nRadioShack is a chain of consumer electronics shops that sold parts to build electronics with: resistors, transistors, etc. Apparently Black Hat managed to build a death ray from the parts there and accidentally vaporized a customer. His line "Figures that\'d be the one day that there\'d be a customer in the aisle" refers to the fact that RadioShack stores have been in steady decline over the years, largely propped up by momentum. \nMicrosoft is the company that makes Windows, and Steve Ballmer was its CEO until being replaced in 2014 by Satya Nadella. Windows Vista is an operating system released in 2007; it was widely panned by software critics. It is unclear how feeding a squirrel through a fax machine could possibly contribute to winning an argument about it.\nRuth Bader Ginsburg is the second female justice on the Supreme Court, appointed by President Clinton. The relevance here is that during her own confirmation hearings, she refused to answer many questions about her personal views, frustrating many Senators (nevertheless, she was confirmed, 96-3). John Roberts, the current Chief Justice, was similarly evasive in his hearings, citing the "Ginsburg Precedent."\nBlack Hat stole a nuclear submarine in xkcd 405: Journal 3 to get his hat back from Danish.\n"Pleading the fifth" is to invoke the Fifth Amendment of the United States Bill of Rights. Specifically, when someone pleads the fifth, they mean that they cannot be compelled to give testimony against themselves. That is, they do not have to say anything that could be taken as an admission of guilt. The third amendment states that no homeowner has to keep troops of the United States Army in their house against their will in peacetime. Either Black Hat\nDoesn\'t understand the 3rd Amendment,\nJust chooses this amendment over the 5th to confuse the committee which seems to forget the question,\nBelieves the nuclear submarine to be his property, and rather than stealing it he was simply expelling military personnel who were "quartered" in his nuclear sub without his permission,\nStole the submarine in order to have a convenient place other than his house to quarter troops\n\n\nThe final panels show Ron Paul\'s blimp finally approaching Washington DC.  The balloon spotted on their radar is presumably piloted by blogger Cory Doctorow. \nAll comics in the Secretary series:\n\n494: Secretary: Part 1\n495: Secretary: Part 2\n496: Secretary: Part 3 (this one)\n497: Secretary: Part 4\n498: Secretary: Part 5\n\nThis series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.\n\n
