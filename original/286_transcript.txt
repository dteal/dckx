n\nThe comic refers to a popular internet phenomenon (meme) called "all your base are belong to us". This catchphrase originates from the arcade shooter "Zero Wing" and is a popular example of a poor translation into the English language. The phrase was popularised throughout the Internet and referenced in various images and videos. It is considered one of the earliest Internet memes, with the first occurrences dating back to the year 1998.\nCueball has, according to the comic, participated in the spread of the meme during its heyday. Ponytail wonders at his keeping the content he created years ago, as the meme\'s popularity has massively decreased since then. Cueball answers that this was always his favourite meme, and that he is waiting for the day it gets revived. His second to last line, "What you say!!" is a line from the game as well, although he says it much sooner than its supposed return to popularity.\nBy using the example of internet memes, the comic also relates to the general principle of fashion that everything once popular will, after a long enough time, be again in vogue. Trends experiencing this renaissance are often referred to as retro. Internet phenomenon can be observed to follow the same rule, although with much shorter intervals due to the speed of information turnover.\nThe title text prophesies the return of the "all your base" meme for 2021 (the date mentioned at the beginning of the game). It also contains a pun on the term "zero hour" and the name of the game which initially brought the phrase into fashion.\n\n
