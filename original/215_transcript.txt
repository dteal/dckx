n\nIn fiction, a character who has had a romantic relationship end will be shown taking some act to remove a sign of their partner\'s presence in their life, e.g. removing/selling a wedding or engagement ring, removing the partner\'s toiletries from the bathroom, or deleting the partner\'s phone number from a cell phone. This is used to symbolize that the character has accepted the end of the relationship and is ready to move on, no longer pining for their loss or seeking to restore the relationship.\nThe first three panels imply that Cueball was presumably in a now-terminated relationship with Megan. The final panel shows him using the Unix command \'userdel\' is used to delete her user account from his computer. The joke here is that he considers this to be a significant part of accepting that she is no longer a part of his life, where most people would consider it a routine administrative task.\nThe title text refers to Cueball\'s thankfulness that he never gave Megan the password to the administrator (\'root\') account on the computer. It is unclear why this is; he might be worried she would have used the access to perform malicious actions after the breakup, or simply glad to be spared the need to change the root password. Alternately, it could be a metaphor for marriage and/or a closer emotional relationship, and he is glad he did not allow her an even greater hold on his heart before the breakup (which would, of course, have entailed commensurately more pain when she did leave him). Not sharing the root password is indicative of a lack of trust in their relationship, which could be a factor in the initial breakdown.\n\n
