n\nAn array of zeros and ones is depicted, 21 across by 23 down. Some of the zeros and ones are red instead of black to form the shape of a Valentine heart.\nThe digits themselves are an ASCII bit stream reading:\n\niloveyOuilOveyouiloveyOuilOveyOuiloveyouilOveyouilOveyOuilOv\n\nThe final octet is incomplete, but the three bits that are present are consistent with the start of an "e".\nThe mixture of upper-case and lower-case "O"s is presumed intentional to avoid a repeating pattern.\n\n
