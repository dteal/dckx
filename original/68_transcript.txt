n\nAt 5:30 AM, one\'s sleep-deprived mind sometimes comes up with things that seem like nonsense later.\nNone of the twelve panels in this comic seem to have any correlation with one another, each one being its own "story," and none of them really make any sense. It is unknown whether Randall really wrote this comic while awake at 5:30 in the morning, or if he wrote it while completely alert and is trying to pass off his rejected ideas by saying what one\'s mind may experience when trying to process information at an hour when the person is not used to being awake.\n\n
