n\nA "Bromance" is a modern slang term for a strong non-romantic relationship between two males. It is a portmanteau of the words brother, meaning a close male friend (aka "bro"), and romance.\nAlthough current in popular media, some commentators have criticized the implicit homophobia in the term, suggesting that it denotes cultural discomfort at relationships of emotional closeness between men. [1]\nIn this comic, Randall is implying the Wikipedia page for the word "bromance" should more accurately represent what most bromances actually are: friendships. This could be a joke to reference the fact that some males prefer to not call friendships as such, for fear of looking unmasculine, or being confused as a gay couple. The comic makes light of the fact that the word bromance and friendship are interchangeable, and should be treated as such.\nThe comic later contains parts of the edited article, mocking the use of "bromance" in popular culture, implying that "friendships" can be used just as easily to describe platonic male relationships.\nDespite supposedly vandalizing the "bromance" article, the article is titled "friendship", giving a similar result to word-replacement browser extensions, as in 1031: s/keyboard/leopard/. It is also possible, however, that a {{DISPLAYTITLE:Friendship}} tag was added to the article\'s source code to cause the page\'s name to display as such.\nThe title text implies Randall does not agree with Wikipedia vandalism, except in the case of bromance/friendship, and also militia/fanclub, possibly to make light of the harsh sounding word in a negative light.\nIn the wake of this comic, several Wikipedia pages were vandalized, among them Bromance, Militia organizations in the United States, Militia (United States), and Friendship. All these pages were semi-protected by an administrator against further attempts for a week after this comic was published.\nThe day this comic was published, a vote to delete the Bromance article was initiated on Wikipedia.[2]\nA later comic called 1746: Making Friends, was also not so much about friendship, but rather about vultures...\n\n
