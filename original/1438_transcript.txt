n\nThis comic appears to be an "alternate reality" view at what could happen today comparing NASA\'s Mission Control with a consumer technical customer service line. It is meant to contrast history with Cueball\'s lack of action. The topic of the comic\xe2\x80\x99s commentary is unknown. The comic may be a commentary about one of the following: \n\nOutsourcing of call centers reducing quality.\nCall centers ignoring critical calls.\nTech savvy people mocking those with limited technological comprehension.\nNASA\'s quality issues in recent decades, potently due to funding cuts and direction shift.\nSomeone named \'Houston\' at a call center picking the phone up.\n\nOn Apollo 13\'s way to the Moon, during a routine stirring of one of the oxygen tanks, an explosion occurred that damaged the craft. Frantic efforts, by the mission control center located in Houston, resulted in the safe return of all astronauts.\nA similar situation is depicted in this strip including the design of the spacecraft, the nature of the problem, and the famous misquote "Houston, we have a problem". The modern type of monitor (flat panel LCD) in front of which Cueball sits suggests that the author is describing a more modern scenario. This time there is much less help from mission control. Upon receiving the message from the spacecraft, Cueball seems fairly indifferent. Instead of attempting to resolve the issue, he mocks the crew for not knowing how to stir and hangs up.\nIn the title text Cueball continues his belligerence by blowing off the crew in favor of a call from his mother.\n\n
