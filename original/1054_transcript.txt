n\nThis comic plays off the American colloquialism "bring home the bacon", which generally means to work hard and bring money home to your family to put food on the table. If a man is out of work he may be stressed out about how to "bring home the bacon." \nSome men would not be assuaged if their wife takes over but at first it seems that White Hat is happy that his wife, who work as a pharmacist, does bring home the bacon, and he tells this to Cueball.\nLater, however, Cueball finds out, that what White Hat actually was saying was "Thebacon", which is a common name for dihydrocodeinone enol acetate an opioid commonly market under names like Acedicon and Diacodin. As a pharmacist White Hat\'s wife has easy access to such drugs, and this may be the reason that he is so calm, because his wife supplies him with painkiller drugs. \nThebacon is compared to the better known drug Vicodin, another opioid sold as a painkiller, which can (and often has) become a drug of abuse.\nThe title text lists what Randall assumes to be the normal pronunciation for Thebacon.\nAccording to Wikipedia, Randall seems to be mistaken in no less than three places (which seems to indicate that Randall has only passing knowledge of the drug and did not do extensive research beforehand):\n\nThe proper name is\nDihydrocodeinone enol acetate, not\nDihydrocodeine enol acetate.\n\nIt is a semisynthetic opioid not a synthetic opioid.\nThe pronunciation is /\xcb\x88\xce\xb8i\xcb\x90b\xc9\x99k\xc9\x92n/\nTHEE-buh-kon, not\nTHEH-buh-kon.\nBy saying I assume, Randall indicates that he didn\'t research the pronunciation.\nAs an alternative explanation, there may be a joke/pun in the mistake.\n\n\n\n
