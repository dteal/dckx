n\nRandall expresses excitement for the time in the future where he can intentionally misuse modern-day slang in order to make nearby teenagers feel uncomfortable. He illustrates this by using the word "pwned", the past tense of "pwn" (from "own", as in to defeat completely): "The noob was pwned by the veteran."\nMany teenagers believe their parents to be not "with the times", but Randall suggests that parents actually do know what the words mean, but are acting otherwise in order to mess with their heads. The title text reinforces this, as every generation has had some form of slang that they used, and it could be possible that this practice has been continued for a good while. It also suggests that the parents of teenagers may be "pwning" their children by intentionally misusing these modern-day slang.\n\n
