n\nIn the final part of Choices, Megan is back to real life, and has forgotten about her trip, as afterlife-Megan said. However, she has an epiphany, and in the spirit of what she told her, she talks to the stranger at the street.\nThe urge to talk to strangers in awkward situations has been touched on in 235: Kite and can also be used when you are already flying a kite (see 1614: Kites.)\nThe title text suggests a weird sociological investigation. The capital "S" in "Science" suggests a personification.\nThe series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday). \nAll parts of "Choices":\n\n264: Choices: Part 1\n265: Choices: Part 2\n266: Choices: Part 3\n267: Choices: Part 4\n268: Choices: Part 5\n\n
