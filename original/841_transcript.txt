n\nCueball is buying some new speakers for his television, and asks Megan if they have the right cord to hook them up. Megan begins chiding him for using "crappy little laptop speakers", i.e. low-powered, low-quality speakers that don\'t faithfully reproduce the sound. \nCueball and Megan reproduce the two extremes of the Audiophile arguments: Cueball simply wants something that works, regardless of the quality, whereas Megan wants to use speakers and sound to create beauty. Cueball seems to think that\'s unnecessary, and Megan snipes back that he\'s never heard beauty, so he wouldn\'t know; after all, he thinks low-bit-rate re-encodings from YouTube (at the time, notorious for dodgy sound quality) are perfectly fine music. Cueball, frustrated with Megan\'s perfectionism, states that he\'s just going to buy cheap, 5-watt speakers. While 5 watts may be a lot if you\'re, say, trying to fill the immediate area with sound from your MP3 player, it\'d sound tinny and hollow, lacking any ommph, coming out of a television across the room. \nCueball, annoyed, tells a snowclone joke, the content of which implies that the content doesn\'t matter to her, only the quality in which it\'s delivered to her ear. \nThe title text is referring to a forum post from audioholics.com, where a user did a blind audio test using monster cable and coat hangers with soldered on alligator clips, and the audiophiles were unable to discern any difference. Randall, getting the wrong idea from it, instead just uses coat-hangers to connect his speakers, not getting that that wasn\'t the point.\n\n
