n\nCueball feels bad because he\'s sick, and his friend tells him to think positively because that will make him feel better. After thinking a bit Cueball notices that, following that reasoning, if he feels bad it is his fault for being so pessimistic. That makes him feel even worse as now he\'s not only sick, but also feels guilty of his own sickness.\nIn the fourth panel, he throws away all the previous reasoning and decides his mood is not the problem: the problem is that he\'s sick. Also, he decides that whatever he feels now he\'ll finally get better because he\'s treating his disease.\nIn the last panel Cueball notices his last comment was actually optimistic, so that makes him feel better. At this point, it should be expected that Cueball\'s friend would say "see? looking at things in an optimistic way actually helps". However, he puts optimism as something bad by using the phrase "you suck at pessimism". Cueball then tries to be optimistic at his "sucking" by thinking he\'ll "be better at pessimism tomorrow". Of course, being good at pessimism is something he should avoid, as it was his very problem in the first panels.\nThe title text takes a serious turn, and acts as an advice for people feeling bad for being sick. The point is that sickness makes one feel bad enough by itself without having to feel guilty for feeling bad when one\'s sick.\nIn the first panel, Cueball is connected to a monitor and an IV (Intravenous therapy). In a real hospital this might be recording data, such as heart rate (HR) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) however in the comic, INT, CON and CHR are also recorded. These may be a reference to character stats in some role playing games. In the "Adventurer Conqueror King" system,  INT=Intelligence. CON=Constitution and CHR=Charisma.\n\n
