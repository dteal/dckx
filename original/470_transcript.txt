n\nPeople show up at protests because they\'re angry about something and want to use peaceful means or otherwise to effect political change. It\'s very much a groupthink, "mob" mentality, bringing to mind the credo, "If you\'re not with us, you\'re against us."\nHardly anyone goes to a protest because they\'re happy about the way things are, and thus, someone holding up signs saying how happy he is would, to say the least, be very out of place at a protest.\nThe title text shows another sign Cueball is carrying (although since it compliments the protesters, he may not get in as much trouble for it).\nThe title of the comic refers to the oft-seen protest placard "The end is nigh", signifying that person\'s belief that we live in the end times and it\'s time to start getting right with (insert religious figure of your choice here).\n\n
