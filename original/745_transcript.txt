n\nThe joke shirt is supposed to be "Dyslexics of the world, Untie!", a nod to the The Far Side comic touching on the same topic (Dyslexics marching in parade, carrying a sign (inadvertently) reading "Dyslexics of the world UNTIE") because dyslexics mixed up the T and the I. In this case, the dyslexics were trying to make a parody of their propensity to transpose letters. The double transposition cancelled out, resulting in the original (but unintended) untransposed message.\nThe title text is an inversion of the inversion of the joke in the comic, in which Randall accidentally wrote the "incorrect" version of the shirt while trying to draw the comic. The last sentence ("I kept [...] wrong") means that, unwittingly, Randall kept failing at failing at failing.\n\n
