n\nThe "Choices" series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday). This is, however, a little sidetrack from the "Choices" narrative. Cueball is studying special relativity. The speed of light in vacuum (299,792,458&#160;m/s) is denoted c. Megan and the spaceship are shown traveling at 0.2c in opposite directions. This would mean (in Newtonian mechanics) 0.4c relatively to them. But due to relativistic effects, their velocities do not simply add when the spaceship observes Megan, in reality both would measure only 0.385c ( = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c2). ) from the other\'s point of view. Also, time dilation influences the way time is observed with reference to the two frames of reference. Megan, however, has other concerns. (This text and part of the image was completely reused in the space part of the interactive 1350: Lorenz (see image here).\nIn the title text Megan thinks about writing about this after-worldly place in Wikipedia, but then realizes that the content would be removed, due to the Wikipedia policy on original research. Even though her claims would be true, she would need reliable written sources to support them.\nAll parts of "Choices":\n\n264: Choices: Part 1\n265: Choices: Part 2\n266: Choices: Part 3\n267: Choices: Part 4\n268: Choices: Part 5\n\nAs this was the second in the series it was released on a Tuesday.\n\n
