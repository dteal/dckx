n\nThe stereotypical nerd is socially inept and has an obsession with a non-mainstream hobby such as Dungeons and Dragons. Nerd males are also known to treat all women (including female nerds) with reverence and awkward fawning due to their supposed inexperience and lack of female company in comparison to other males. In the comic, the nerd girl uses this as an excuse for her social ineptitude.\nThe T-shirt the girl is wearing contains the text "Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons," which is an actual text used for T-shirts, continuing with "for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup!". This text is a modified version of a quote from Tolkien\'s The Fellowship of the Ring: "Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.".\nTo all the high schoolers, who are at the stage when they begin to find dates, Randall is saying that it is nothing personal, i.e. he is not trying to insult them by pointing this situation out.\n\n
