n\nThe boot sector of a hard drive is where the information for operating systems is stored. It tells the computer to load a program; in most cases this is an operating system. If this sector is overwritten, an operating system stored on the drive can\'t be booted into.\nThe first three panels suggest that the "sappy love note" is to someone else, indicating that Megan is seeing someone else; the last panel reveals that it is just that she overwrote the boot sector of Cueball\'s computer out of anger.\nThe .conf files of Linux- and Unix-based systems are text based files where all the settings for various applications are stored. Since all the configurations were replaced with "sweet nothings" - whispered lovers\' talk, or literal nothings (blank space or meaningless jumbles of characters) - none of the programs work as they should. X is the X Window System, the most common GUI framework used on modern Linux and Unix systems. Once upon a time it was notoriously hard to configure correctly, even when starting from a known good configuration, let alone a destroyed one.  (More recent versions of X configure themselves correctly for most users without a .conf file.)\n\n
