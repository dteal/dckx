n\nThe comic is a parody of Transformers, a fictional group of robots that can transform into vehicles. Transformers typically are able to transform instantaneously, often mid-stride, by manipulating and rearranging their mechanical parts. In this comic, however, Randall has the Transformers "transform" in the same manner that caterpillars "transform" via metamorphosis into butterflies or moths.\nThe first two panels show action scenes that would be appropriate for a Transformers comic. However, the third panel shows the Transformers climbing a tree, and in the final scene they wrap silk around themselves, apparently forming a cocoon or chrysalis.\nThe title text furthers this parallel, describing a newly transformed helicopter \xe2\x80\x94 presumably the post-metamorphosis state of one of the Transformers in the panels \xe2\x80\x94 in a manner that would be more appropriate for a freshly-emerged butterfly or moth.\nThis xkcd comic is one of the few ones not showing just simple stick figures.\n\n
