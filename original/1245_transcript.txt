n\nThe 10-day forecast is a prediction of the weather extending 10 days into the future (with varying degrees of accuracy). However, when Cueball checks the forecast for his local area, it apparently predicts progressively extreme lightning storms, a plague of insects, what appears to be The Rapture, and the appearance of the anti-Christ. Upon the anti-Christ (or perhaps Woden or Mothra) appearing, the forecast breaks up into static and nothingness with the day stuck on Tuesday, meaning that the world has ended.\nWhen asked about this, Megan casually explains that Cueball put a minus (-) sign in front of his ZIP code. A ZIP code is a numeric postal code used in the United States, but many more countries use similar systems. As ZIP codes are tied to a geographic location, it is also often used to specify a local region for the purposes of weather reports.\nMany computer systems that let the user write in a number only work with certain numbers (such as positive numbers). Numbers the system is not designed to work with, such as negative numbers, may lead to errors or unpredictable behavior (or, more often, the system will just refuse to proceed until you input a valid number). When this happens with the number of a video game level, it can result in data of another type being loaded, creating a level with a corrupted or physically-impossible landscape; this is sometimes known as a "Minus World".\nMegan states that you get this result for any negative zip code. This may be an "error" deliberately put in by the programmers designing the system, to freak out people who make a mistake.\nCueball on the other hand reacts as if this negative zip code actually represents an actual geographical location, or a real-life Minus World, and that the weather forecaster is indeed showing an accurate forecast for the (corrupted) area. Since Megan stated that the forecast is always like that for these zip code Cueball expresses that he would never move there.\nIn the title text, Megan agrees with Cueball\'s desire not to move to that ZIP code area, the punchline being that her reason is not to avoid the apocalypse, but to retain access to Amazon Prime, which shows that her priorities are amusingly warped. The service Amazon Prime is provided by Amazon, where the user pays a flat annual fee and in exchange they get access a number of "enhanced" Amazon services, including free two-day shipping, free access to a library of streaming videos, and the ability to borrow books.\nLater, a Five-Day Forecast was also made into a comic.\n\n
