n\nThe comic takes aim at the societal obsession with the male sexual organ ("phallocentrism"), especially in regards to size. In general, depictions of an erect penis (also called phallus) represent male potency.\nWhile present in every human civilization, the symbol of the penis is also prominently featured in modern mass media. Many films and television series make use of penis-related jokes. A very common trope is the male obsession with the idea that a larger penis is considered more desirable and a smaller penis less manly or satisfying to women.\nMegan criticizes this obsession by pointing out that most penises are about the same size, and normal variations in size are not worth getting worked up about.\nThe title text refers to the excessive advertisement for potency pills and penis enlargement in spam emails. The symbol of the phallus can be regarded as omnipresent in modern society, with presumably every public toilet sporting at least one badly drawn depiction of a penis.\n\n
