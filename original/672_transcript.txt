n\nSocial networking site Facebook routinely suggests reconnecting with Facebook friends whom you haven\'t interacted with on the website for a while. This is taken to its logical extreme in this comic when that Facebook feature repeatedly, in an increasingly voyeuristic fashion, tries to get Cueball to hook up with his occasional friend-with-benefits Susie, despite the fact that Cueball knows she\'s falling for him and doesn\'t want to lead her on.\nAccording to the title text, Cueball and Susie (who is drawn as a sexy version of Megan) do end up hooking up, even against Cueball\'s better judgement, as so often happens between people who\'re physically attracted to one another. And he apparently left the webcam on as well, because the Facebook feature is now giving suggestions on what Cueball should do to her, mid-coitus.\n\n
