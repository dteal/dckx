n\nIt is argued by some that atheism leads to nihilism. One rebuttal would be to reject the premise that there is no purpose outside of fulfilling divine intention, but Randall instead rejects the premise that nihilism ought to be burdensome. As a result, Beret Guy resolves that, if everything is ultimately meaningless, then it would be more fun to spend one\'s meaningless existence having fun rather than constantly moping. As reinforced by the title text, the complete lack of angst on Beret Guy\'s part is off-putting to other nihilists.\n\n
