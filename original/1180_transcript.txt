n\nRandall uses an Euler diagram (technically not a Venn diagram) to make fun of clueless computer users. A common response to any computer problem is: "Maybe it has a virus?". The circles in the diagram don\'t overlap, meaning: 1) Problems that people suspect are virus-caused are never virus-caused. 2) Problems that are actually virus-caused are never suspected by people to be caused by a virus.\nThe title text refers to the technological singularity, a hypothetical point in the future when superintelligence emerges in computers, so that they can build new computers with ever increasing intelligence. It is seen as impossible to predict what would happen beyond this point; hence the term "singularity". 1084: Server Problem makes a joke on this.\n"Defragging" is short for disk defragmentation, an easy, user-friendly action that PC users can undertake to supposedly make their computers run faster. It is therefore a common all-round recommendation to do this, regardless of the problem. Randall suggests the same clueless users would encounter the singularity and attempt defragging. It probably won\'t help much.\n\n
