n\nGedankedank is a humorous portmanteau of Gedankenexperiment (German for "thought experiment") and badonkadonk (slang term for an attractive, round butt).\nAlbert Einstein often used thought experiments to explore scientific hypotheses too impractical or impossible to actually perform, in order to examine their consequences. Moving close to the speed of light, c, is nigh-impossible with existing technology; and according to Einstein\'s theory of special relativity accelerating a mass exactly to c is impossible. Einstein is well known not to have cared about his appearance (e.g. (WARNING: TVTropes link) his uncombed hair, the tongue photo, etc.) so it is unlikely that he pondered how relativistic velocity would affect the appearance of his butt.\nLorentz contraction is a consequence of special relativity, whereby objects contract in the direction of travel. An object traveling exactly at c (rather than near light speed) would be squished completely flat. It would also have infinite mass, infinite energy, and experience no passage of time until slowed by an outside force.\nThe appearance of rotation while moving close to the speed of light is known as Terrell rotation. The title text then connects this rotation to the Shakira song "Hips Don\'t Lie".\n\n
