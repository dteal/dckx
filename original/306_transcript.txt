n\nDebian is a GNU/Linux distribution (but also ships GNU Hurd and BSD versions). Red Hat is the company behind Fedora Linux and RHEL.\nThe comic is about orphaned Linux projects, because volunteer FOSS developers will often leave their projects aside whenever something of greater importance to them requires more time (like dating relationships, tiredness, sickness etc.). Some companies/foundations, while not needing these developers, can greatly benefit from community-maintained projects. The Debian Team uses a parody of the famous Yoda quote from the first Star Wars movie in the first panel "Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering" by replacing it with dating and orphaned projects.\nHitch is a romantic comedy in which Will Smith plays a "dating coach", who helps men to have successful dates with women. To avoid losing their developers, both companies have opted to hire Hitch-like advisors to give them intentionally bad dating advice, thus sabotaging their relationship before it could become distracting: The man is advised to criticize his date in an attempt to appear more intelligent (something very unlikely to work, but nonetheless attempted by some men), and in the title text, we learn that the woman is being similarly advised to watch lots of romantic comedies (bad advice because stereotypically guys do not love those).\n\n
