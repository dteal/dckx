n\nThis comic coincides with the announcement of a new smart watch by Apple earlier in the week as of the comic\'s release (9th Sept 2014), the Apple Watch, along with a large emphasis on smartwatches at IFA 2014 (Sept 5-10), particularly \'Android Wear\'.\nThe timeline shows a period approximately from 2005 to 2015 where our wrists were liberated from the tethers of wearing a watch, likely attributed to the fact that many instead used a mobile \'smart\' phone to tell the time.\nWhilst other smart watches have been released in the past, Randall predicts that the typical widespread interest following Apple product releases (combined with many other new releases by other companies) will result in our wrists again being shackled in the grip of watches from 2015. The wording of the label suggests that Randall is pre-emptively mourning the imminent loss of freedom of his and others\' wrists, though may be humorous hyperbole/sarcasm, as his position has generally been of apathy, such as in 1215: Insight.\nThe title text refers to how \'old people\' tend to express derision towards change (generally most widely accepted by \'young people\') as not being like it was \'in the good old days\', even if this means they contradict themselves. Initial wearing of watches was viewed negatively by the older generation, but now \'not\' wearing a watch is instead negative. The second part of the title text starts as if Randall is going to express an opinion on wearing a watch, but then veers off to mock the word \'thinkpiece\', due to its (particularly recent) connotation for lacking factual content and expressing biased opinions. For more details on thinkpiece see this article. By equating thinkpiece with brain, Randall is making a reference to the fact that this compound word does not follow the convention of the compound word timepiece, which is a synonym for watch.\n\n
