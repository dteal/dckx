n\nRon Paul is an American physician, author, and politician who is a House Representative for Texas and is a three-time Presidential candidate, running as a Libertarian and a Republican. He has a very dedicated and vocal base of supporters who believe he is the only true alternative to either side of the Two-Party System.  These supporters go under the name "Ron Paul Revolution" with the letters "evol" reversed to emphasise "love".\nTron is a movie made by Disney. The title text refers to the line of virtual light that streams out from the back of Tron\'s light grid vehicles. Normally it is a single, solid color, but in the comic it is the color of the American flag to show Ron\'s patriotism. There is also a joke about Pok\xc3\xa9mon in the phrase "... evolves into ...". Pok\xc3\xa9mon is a game where the player, a "Trainer", has their Pok\xc3\xa9mon battle other Pok\xc3\xa9mon to level the Pok\xc3\xa9mon up. As the Pok\xc3\xa9mon levels up, they evolve into the next, more powerful, form of the Pok\xc3\xa9mon.\nWhy Ron Paul and Cory Doctorow appear to be fighting, is only because Ron Paul favors down-sizing the US government over anything else, whereas Cory Doctorow believes he must support fellow bloggers no matter what.\nThere is a subtle joke in the panel where Ron Paul and Cory Doctorow are firing at each other; the sound effect for Cory\'s guns is "Boing! Boing!," which is the name of Cory Doctorow\'s blog. Also, a visual joke is that Cory\'s turret in panel 5 very much resembles an upside-down Dalek.\nThe reference to gold touches on Ron Paul\'s desire to see monetary policy once again be driven by the gold standard, namely that a country\'s currency value be driven not by its economic activity, but by the amount of physical gold it owns. Earlier in American history, this was the case; owning a dollar would (in theory) be owning one dollar\'s worth of gold somewhere in the treasury. This is in contrast with the current international practice, where countries are able to print an arbitrary quantity of paper money that is not necessarily backed by physical gold. Adherence to the gold standard is an extreme minority view; most economists, and the population at large, agree that the current system is much better.  This may also be a reference to the final scene in The Italian Job, where the heroes face a decision over losing a large quantity of gold - or death.\nAll comics in the Secretary series:\n\n494: Secretary: Part 1\n495: Secretary: Part 2\n496: Secretary: Part 3\n497: Secretary: Part 4 (this one)\n498: Secretary: Part 5\n\nThis series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.\n\n
