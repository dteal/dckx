n\nApple Jacks is a breakfast cereal produced by Kellogg\'s. As the image text begins to explain, there was an ad campaign for the cereal in the 1990s which focused on someone (usually someone in authority like a parent) pointing out that Apple Jacks don\'t taste like apples, and one or more kids pointing out that it doesn\'t matter and that "we eat what we like."  However, instead of the campaign\'s response with the son laughing off his dad\'s comment and correcting him, this son responds by simply saying "fuck off, dad."\nThis could be a commentary on today\'s youth being far less respectful, as the son is playing video games, and seems annoyed at being interrupted. Also, it could be not the first time the father has used the line. It could also be saying that the response in the ads is unrealistic and that this is a much more realistic response.\nThe same ad campaign was referenced previously in 27: Meat Cereals on a parody cereal labeled Scrapple Jacks.\nCereal advertising was again referenced in 1470: Kix.\nThe title text could be a reference to the fact that this comic requires explanation for those who haven\'t known of the ad (the reason this webpage exists). Another of the early comics where Randall felt the need to explain the joke in the title text.\n\n
