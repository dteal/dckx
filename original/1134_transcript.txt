n\nThe comic is a play on the classic wolf, goat and cabbage puzzle belonging to the river crossing puzzles, and first known from Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes, with the same setting as here. The three possessions change between various retellings but it typically involves a carnivorous animal (wolf, lion etc.), a herbivore (goat, sheep, chicken, goose etc.), and some plant based food (cabbage, grain, beans etc.). The objective is to ferry all three possessions to the other side of a river safely in a small boat, with the limitation of only being able to transport one possession per crossing. The crossing order must take into account that the carnivore would eat the herbivore if left alone together, and the herbivore would eat the food. \nThe traditional solution would be:\n\n\n\n\n Origin\n\n Destination\n\n\n Cueball, Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\n\n\n\n Trip 1: Take goat across\n\n\n Wolf, Cabbage\n\n Cueball, Goat\n\n\n Trip 2: Return alone\n\n\n Cueball, Wolf, Cabbage\n\n Goat\n\n\n Trip 3: Take cabbage across\n\n\n Wolf\n\n Cueball, Goat, Cabbage\n\n\n Trip 4: Return with goat\n\n\n Cueball, Wolf, Goat\n\n Cabbage\n\n\n Trip 5: Take wolf across\n\n\n Goat\n\n Cueball, Wolf, Cabbage\n\n\n Trip 6: Return alone\n\n\n Cueball, Goat\n\n Wolf, Cabbage\n\n\n Trip 7: Take goat across\n\n\n\n\n Cueball,Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nBy leaving the wolf behind, four steps are saved \xe2\x80\x94 the comic\'s "step 4" is just a comment \xe2\x80\x94 and the troublesome wolf, a wild and dangerous animal not usually kept by humans, is eliminated from the picture.\nThis could be seen a jab on the common assumption that logic puzzles only have one correct solution. Thus one often keeps the other person thinking and guessing until they arrive at the pre-defined solution, no matter how many other creative good solutions they come up with. Also note that the "problem" given doesn\'t even state an objective, just three prerequisites.\nThe title texts says that goats are fine. The same opinion is in 1282: Monty Hall.\n\n
