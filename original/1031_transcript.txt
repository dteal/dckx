n\nRandall\'s browser looks like Google Chrome and he has installed at least four extensions on it, which explains the little symbols to the right of the address bar. Extensions are small programs that install into your Internet browser and change the Web pages as you view them. Some make pages easier to read, some remove ads (the third extension is AdBlock) and so on. \nFor the joke in this comic, an extension accidentally replaces the word "keyboard" with "leopard" in a regex (or regular expression). In computing, a regular expression provides a concise and flexible means to "match" (specify and recognize) patterns in text, such as particular characters or words. The command to substitute/replace a string is "s", e.g. "s/old/new/" replaces any occurrence of "old" with "new". The title therefore contains the command to change "keyboard" into "leopard."\nIt\'s not clear what the extension Randall installed was actually supposed to do, but most extensions that revolve around text replacement are humorous in nature (such as Cloud to Butt, which replaces all instances of "the cloud" with "my butt").\nThe title text references the common IT phrase "Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair" or PEBKAC, which means that the problem is caused by the user, not by any failure of the computer.\nThere has been several comics using substitutions, both before and after this one.\n\n
