n\nA Zeppelin is a type of rigid dirigible aircraft, used in the early part of the 20th century for commercial airline traffic. They were well known for being the most luxurious, comfortable air travel of the time. The Hindenburg disaster, as well as World War II, led to the end of their use as commercial airliners. Also associated with the Zeppelin name is a particular design of wristwatches,[1] notable for having the word "Zeppelin" at the top of the dial, at or under where the number 12 would be. In this comic, Randall implies that, since the hour hand of the watch is pointing to the word Zeppelin, it is time for a Zeppelin to appear in the sky.\nThe title text refers to the webcomic Buttercup Festival, which, at the time of this comic, was defunct. It was later revived by the author. As of 2/02/15, the comic is once again defunct. It is a tribute to Buttercup festival in the way it interprets things in the world na\xc3\xafvely and literally to achieve humour, in a simple yet effective and uncontrived way.\n\n
