n\nMicroSD is one format of the Secure Digital memory card format, used in digital cameras, cell phones, and other devices. It is very small, only  15\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971 mm, but can hold as much as 200GB of data (as of March 2015).\nThe main character in the comic (on the right) thinks about all the ideas that could be expressed by the data in the microSD card, or in a library. He feels not just reverent and intimidated, but sexually aroused by the thought. As he begins to touch it, his friend is disgusted by what might happen if he uses the card as some kind of sex toy, and does not want to help him locate the card if it gets "lost" inside a body cavity.\nThe title text seems to be the main character thinking about how much data the card holds, in terms of floppy disks and the iTunes music library, and feeling aroused by these thoughts.\nRandalls claims in the title text do check out. A high density floppy disk with a FAT format holds about 1.4 MB of data, and has dimensions of 90\xc3\x9794\xc3\x973 mm, for a volume of about 2.5 cm\xc2\xb3. A refrigerator carton is the large cardboard box that fridges are delivered in. A typical refrigerator carton may be 1800\xc3\x97700\xc3\x97700 mm, a volume of about 0.9 m\xc2\xb3. So a fridge carton could hold about 35000 90mm floppies, or roughly 50GB. This is comparable to the storage on a single microSD card. A soda can (1 ml = 1 cm\xc2\xb3) could hold 3000 microSD cards, or store 50TB of data. However, the iTunes store claims to hold 26 million songs (as of Summer 2014), and allowing for about 2MB per song gives 50 TB of music. The claim that a soda can could hold the iTunes library seems to be reasonable.\nRelated to this topic is this xkcd What If blog entry.\n\n
