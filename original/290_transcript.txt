n\nSometimes, something suddenly goes wrong and you can only shout obscenities at it. For instance, when the dog bites, when the bee stings, something unexpected happens, or a program crashes (e.g. a segfault) the victim often reacts by swearing.\nFor Randall, however, profanities are caused mostly by blue shells in the video game Mario Kart. The blue shells, when fired, target the player currently in first place and stop them cold. In a close game near the end of the race, a player can go from first to an unrecoverable last in one hit. \nThe title text refers to the "Double Dash" edition of Mario Kart. This includes a technique to avoid being hit by a blue shell, but it requires skillful timing to accomplish.  The term "deep magic" comes from computer programmer slang. Interestingly, with a boost mushroom in Mario Kart Wii, (and the so-called "Super-Horn" in Mario Kart 8,) it is also possible (with accurate timing) to escape blue shells.\n\n
