n\nWhen Cueball asks Black Hat for a favor he seems to be making a rude gesture, by lifting a finger towards Cueball. The word he says Commented! does, however, not seem to fit with the shorter four letter word usually combined with such a gesture. \nCueball also fails to understand this, but as it turns out as the panels move around Black Hat and zooms in on his fingers, he is not making this rude gesture, but is instead actually lifting two fingers toward Cueball, forming a double slash and thereby ignoring both him and his question for a favour, by commenting him out programming style, even to the point where Black Hat sees the commenting out slashes, Cueball and anything he says in the color for ignored parts of the program (or real world in this case)\nIn certain programming languages (including but not limited to C (since C99), C++, C#, Java, Javascript, PHP, and Scala), inserting a double slash (//) in a line marks everything after the double slash in the line as a "comment"; i.e. something for humans to read that generally helps them understand the code better, rather than something for the computer to execute. Since all comment lines are ignored when a program is run or compiled, it is possible to simply put a double slash in front of any line of code to skip that line. This is known as "commenting out" the line.\nAn Integrated Development Environment (IDE for short) is an application that programmers use to write, compile, execute, and debug code. Many IDEs color-code text to make reading the code easier. In IDEs like Eclipse and Microsoft Visual Studio, a line that is commented out will be colored green, however the color may vary depending on which IDE you use, and can usually also be customized. The title text refers to this variation among IDEs\' color schemes.\n\n
