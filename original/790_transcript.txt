n\nIn a product experiment, two groups of people are given a certain pill or lotion. Some people are given the product to be tested, while others (the control group) are given a placebo; nobody is told which group they belong to. The control group acts as a norm for comparison against the others.\nRandall has messed with this process by giving LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) to the control group. LSD is a drug that causes hallucinations and distortions in the perception of time and space. Megan, apparently a control, is experiencing spiders in her hallucinations. Since the control group is supposed to reflect what "normally" happens, this is indeed very confusing to the scientists. While hallucinating in the comic Megan is drawn as if she had 8 limbs, just like spiders have 8 legs.\nHowever, given the scientists are confused, this means that they must know which person is in which group. This implies that the trial isn\'t double-blinded, which in and of itself would impact the veracity of the study. In a properly double-blinded study, the scientists would not know Megan was the control and would only dutifully record their observations. (Alternatively, this is simply an unexpected result for either group.)\nThe title text suggests that, in a different study, this substitution was performed when the product being tested was itself LSD. This led to the conclusion that LSD is no more likely to cause hallucinations than a placebo, somehow implying that LSD is not a hallucinogen.  We can only hope they were able to redo the test, as in layman\'s terms "Nonsense MUST be wrong".\n\n
