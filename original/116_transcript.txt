b'[[A picture of various apartment buildings]]\nShadowed city slumber silently. A second-story suite.\nCome craving courtship, selected serendipitously\nCrazed copulations, a salacious storm  of continuous coitus.\nSpread, straddled, conquered.  \nCountless crashed suitors strewn carelessly.\nCentre, silken sheets sensuously caressing soft skin,\nContentedly sleeps your mom.'
