n\nMost online communities face the problem of dissuading spammers from joining and participating. A common solution to this problem is the use of various systems to prevent automated bots\' use of the community, while still allowing legitimate users to join. This has resulted in an arms race of sorts between spammers and communities, in which the spammers try to bypass increasingly difficult spam-prevention methods.\nThis captcha and spamming prevention also has a downside, in that the time it takes to "prove you\'re human" is sometimes so long as to drive users away because their time is being wasted.\nThis comic explores the culmination of that arms race, in which an advanced spam-prevention system, built by Cueball, is able to defeat the concept of spamming itself by forcing spammers to contribute constructively to a community.\nCaptcha is one of the methods used to prevent lots of automated registering of fake user names used by bots and spammers. It consists of asking a person to prove that they are human before registering them as user and allowing them to post on sites or forum topics. That is done by using pictures of words and letters that humans may recognize, but bots and OCR software have trouble with.\nNow, artificial intelligence (AI) of bots have advanced so far, that Cueball has invented a new system. It asks the users to rate a slate of comments as constructive or not, then asks them to reply with comments of their own. Megan asks what will happen when spammers find a way around his system, such as making bots that make constructive and helpful comments? Well, it turns out that is what he is trying to accomplish in first place, a thriving community of bots and humans helping its members with constructive and helpful comments, as well as coming one step closer to the singularity.\nThe title text investigates the consequences of such system further by thinking of people unable to give constructive and helpful comments, which are sort of people you don\'t want in your online community anyway.\n\n
