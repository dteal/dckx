n\nThere are often people who claim to have supernatural powers, but then when their powers are tested by some sort of experiment, the experiment refutes their claims. This comic summarizes all the data from such experiments, observing that given the data, it\'s very unlikely that supernatural powers actually exist.\nThe title text refers to a person who has claimed to have supernatural powers, and suggests that he might really have such powers. This invokes the fact that absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence, although there has never previously been a confirmed example of a person with superpowers this does not prove that this is certainly impossible. However the graph above suggests that, although not impossible, such an event would be highly unlikely. No matter how much evidence we collect there is always some positive (but vanishingly small) chance, that some person may hold supernatural powers.\nAlternatively the title text explains that even though there is no reason to believe anyone has any super powers, some people are always ready to believe the next one to claim so - very naive - and the exact opposite meaning of the one described above. Knowing Randall\'s comic, this seems more likely. In this case the two other comics mentioned has no relation to this comic.\nThe title itself may be a reference to the TV show Supernatural\'s recap segment, "The Road So Far."\n\n
