n\nPonytail presents her company\'s FY2015 (Fiscal Year for 2015) budget for cyberintelligence. But is then interrupted with a snide remark about the prefix cyber.\nThis comic illustrates that some organization spends obscene amounts of money on their "cyberintelligence" budget, yet all that spending appears not to have informed them that the prefix "cyber-" fell out of fashion years ago. That the prefix could annoy experts were already used in the title text of 1084: Server Problem.\nThe prefix "cyber" is derived from "Cybernetic," which comes from the Greek word \xce\xba\xcf\x85\xce\xb2\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xbd\xce\xb7\xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xcf\x8c\xcf\x82, meaning skilled in steering or governing. Cyberintelligence could also be called cyber spying i.e. spying in the digital world, one of many "new" words with the cyber- prefix. Many were invented in the 1980s and 1990s, following the example of "cyberspace", popularized by William Gibson in 1982.\nIf cyberintelligence departments were given names today, they might be called Internet Intelligence, Virtual Intelligence, Data Intelligence or Online Intelligence departments.\nThis may be due to the fact that government organizations are typically named by middle-aged or senior officials who are generally less likely to be familiar with the current trends in technology language. They are more likely to stick to the words that were used when they first learned about the technology.\nThe title text continues the joke by implying the organization learned about the demise of "cyber-" yet failed to process or analyze that data. It may also be a reference to the previous comic, which was a link to a survey for xkcd readers.\n"Cyberspace" and "cybernetics", illustrated here, are two of the most common words with that prefix (Cyberspace 6 times as prevalent as cybernetics at their peaks). "Cyberintelligence" is shown here. Cyberspace was used 4000 times more often, although the more common spelling splitting it in two words "Cyber intelligence" was 1.35 times more used than in one word. But even combining these two versions cyberspace is still used more than 1700 times as often.\n\n
