n\nRandall attempts to draw a five-pointed star; the easiest way to do this free-hand is by drawing a pentagram, the simplest regular star figure in geometry. Once you\'ve seen it done, you can usually draw a pentagram in one continuous motion.\nSimply put, Randall gets self-conscious and messes up.\nThe title text explains the fact that a five-pointed star has all angles at 36 degrees which sums to 180, like a common triangle. So Randall converts to Judaism with its six pointed star symbol, which he hopes is easier to draw because it is composed of two equilateral triangles. This also suggests that he is converting from neopaganism just to have a religious star he can draw well.\n\n
