n\nThis comic features a man and a woman in a romantic setting, surrounded by a fractal combination of love and doubts; a Sierpinski Triangle-like arrangement based on the Apollonian gasket construction. Three circles are drawn tangent to each other, then additional circles are added which are tangent to three existing circles (without overlapping), ad infinitum.\nRandall\'s character design wasn\'t yet fully settled. Considering that Megan arguably was introduced two comics ago, and that the man has some hair, the couple might or might not be interpreted as Cueball and Megan.\nRandall\'s later blog and book have the same name, What If?, though with very different meaning.\n\n
