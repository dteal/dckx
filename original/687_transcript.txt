n\nCueball has a hobby \xe2\x80\x94 showing correct calculations according to the dimensional analysis \xe2\x80\x94 but with ridiculous correlations of uncorrelated events and measurements. Here Cueball is teaching a class and uses this trick to convince his students that the Toyota Prius combined EPA gas mileage is somehow connected to the constant \xcf\x80 via the Planck energy, the pressure at the earth\'s core and the width of the English Channel. \nScientists \xe2\x80\x94 often physicists \xe2\x80\x94 use dimensional analysis to quickly check if a given formula can possibly relate to a physical system, because if you end up with an equation claiming that joules are meters, something is clearly wrong. Dimensional analysis here refers to the check if both sides of the equation arrive at the same physical unit when the units of all variables get plugged into the equation. This requires knowledge of the system of units and the relation between different physical units.\nCueball uses the following equation to make a mockery of the practice:\n\n(Planck energy) / (Pressure at the core of the earth) * (Prius combined EPA gas mileage) / (minimum width of the English Channel) = \xcf\x80\n\n
