n\nThis comic criticizes our culture\'s tendency to romanticize young love (such as that portrayed in Romeo and Juliet and Titanic). Although young lovers do often have intense feelings for their beloved, for many of them, like Megan here, it is an infatuation based on little substance (such as a similar taste in music) rather than the real compatibility necessary for a long-term relationship. \nThe title text broadens this criticism to all forms of romance. Randall appears to be stating that it is possible to love someone even if your relationship with that person doesn\'t conform to the impossibly high standards of "true love" that our culture so highly exalts. In fact, healthy relationships are typically not perfect and require work, change, and compromise rather than continual, effortless bliss.\n\n
