n\nFirefly was a television series aired by Fox in 2002. The star of the show was Captain Malcolm (or Mal) Reynolds, played by Nathan Fillion.\nMegan tries to play the rational card, and insist that the characters of major TV shows must get tired of fans\' never-ending need to see them playing that character, and never being themselves. Nathan Fillion, however, appears to miss the days of Firefly so much that he spends his time reenacting his role as Malcolm at home.\nIn the fourth panel Cueball suggests they race for charities, which would mean the winner gets to donate the prize money to their charity of choice. In the fifth panel Fillion, takes the phrase and twists it to mean that the winner gets the charity. This is why Cueball says the confused line "Come again?"\nThe title text refers both to Mal being referred to by Kaylee as "Captain Tightpants" in the episode "Shindig," and to Captain Hammer, a superhero played by Nathan Fillion in another series created by Joss Whedon: Dr. Horrible\'s Sing-Along Blog. "Hammerpants" may also be a reference to the odd, puffy parachute pants worn by 1990s rapper MC Hammer.\nAll comics in "The Race" series:\n\n577: The Race: Part 1\n578: The Race: Part 2 (this one)\n579: The Race: Part 3\n580: The Race: Part 4\n581: The Race: Part 5\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days(Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.\nElectric skateboards have been the subject of several other comics like 139: I Have Owned Two Electric Skateboards, 409: Electric Skateboard (Double Comic) and a panel in 442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel.\n\n
