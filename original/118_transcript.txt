n\nThe comic provides alternate lyrics to the chorus of the 1975 song "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover" (Video) by American artist Paul Simon. Both the original and alternate lyrics provide a textual hook because the first name at the end of the line is rhymed with the last word of the line before (back/Jack, plan/Stan, go/Joe).\nRandall, we learn from the image text, heard Simon\'s song during a 70\'s hit marathon, went to sleep, and while being sleepy replaced "lover" by "hover" while writing the last line of the song\'s chorus. Thus changing this line from to leave your lover into to learn to hover. Clearly, this amused him so much he decided to create a comic where people learn how to hover, rather than leaving their lover.\n\n
