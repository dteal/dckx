n\nCueball\'s (Cueball-like) friend makes fun of his imagination that involves a flying ferret, and then suggests to go play video games instead. This shows the irony of his definition of "imagination."  He makes fun of Cueball\'s creative fantasy while instead opting for a mass-produced fantasy.\nThe fact that Cueball lies about his goal could be a commentary on abandoning dreams to avoid confronting societal expectations.\nThe title text refers to the fact Randall\'s brother in real life had such a pet ferret. Originally Randall drew this comic while the ferret was still alive. And then it died in between his posting it on LiveJournal and reposting it with a title text on the new xkcd site. He now wished that it will rest in peace. "RIP" stands for "Rest In Peace", from the original Latin "Requiescat in pace" as derived from a traditional Catholic burial service.  The initialism or phrase was commonly placed on gravestones to indicate the hope that, in whatever existence the deceased now finds him- or herself, he or she may have peace.  It has become a frequent motif in cartoons to indicate the death of an individual or character, which has likely contributed to its widespread use to denote the passing of a person, pet, or even abstract concept in popular culture, outside of Catholicism.\n\nThe ferret returns in 31: Barrel - Part 5 and did in this way become part of the Barrel series and this has also been canonized by Randall as can be seen on this web-archive version of xkcd: The Boy and his Barrel.\nThe full series can be found here. But below they are listed in the order Randall has put them in his collection linked to above:\n\n 1: Barrel - Part 1\n 20: Ferret\n 11: Barrel - Part 2\n 22: Barrel - Part 3\n 25: Barrel - Part 4\n 31: Barrel - Part 5\n\n
