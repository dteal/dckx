n\nThe comic appears to be a reference to 475: Further Boomerang Difficulties, which had a man throwing a boomerang that never returned. Cueball shoots an arrow off with a bow and a boomerang returns to him. This confounds him. As it was also a Cueball that threw the boomerang in the other comic, this may be the same Cueball that now finally has his boomerang return to him after a long time (464 comics later). This would really freak him out then.\nThe title text is a pun on how boomerangs always come back, along with how "The Return of X" is often used for movie names.\nHowever, as shown in the prequel as well as in an even earlier comic, Cueball/Randall has to admit: I Am Not Good with Boomerangs. So for him it would be a surprise if the boomerang returned!\nBoomerangs also became a main theme in the interactive comic 1350: Lorenz.\n\n
