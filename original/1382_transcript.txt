n\nIn the early 20th century, visions of the future usually stipulated that everyone would travel around with rockets strapped to their backs. However, this has not come to pass.\nIn this comic, Randall is pointing out that the problem with personal rocket packs - more commonly called jet packs - is not how to attach a rocket to someone\'s back, but other practical considerations. One might be how to keep the hot exhaust from burning the user\'s calves. Many jet pack designs actually do have ways to deal with this, such as moving the rockets farther from the user, but there are many other practical issues which have made this an impractical form of travel given current technology.\nThe title text starts with the trope "I want my jet pack". It continues with pointing out that if people did start using rocket packs, there would also be more injuries, raising health care costs. That\'s something that people usually don\'t consider when imagining a future where these devices are commonplace.\nSo this year when the comics was published the demand was:\n\n \'It\'s 2014--I want my jetpack [and also my free medical care covering all my jetpack-related injuries]!\' \n\n
