n\nThis comic makes fun of a certain type of images very common on the internet. Those pictures are taken with a camera turned by 90\xc2\xb0 or rotated later by software, thus creating the illusion of people walking on walls or ceilings. While the original pictures depict the physical impossibility of a rotated gravitational force, Cueball uses the aforementioned technique to create pictures of himself on a climbing wall. Megan approaches him from above the wall, indicating that the climbing wall is in fact lying on the floor. It becomes clear that Cueball was not able to climb a real wall and therefore crawled on the floor with his camera adjusted accordingly.\nHer comment is a sideswipe on the practise of self-display on Facebook, which is often done with the help of image manipulation.\nThe title text implies that Cueball has in fact stolen a real climbing wall, and that Megan wants him to return it.\n\n
