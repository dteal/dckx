n\nSpoofing off of tornado chasers are these permafrost chasers, who are just like tornado chasers, but they are chasing very boring permafrost. Permafrost is a layer of ground that never thaws, unlike ground south of where it exists, where the ground freezes in winter and thaws in the spring.\nTwister was a movie about a crazy group of tornado chasers trying to drop a probe releasing device named Dorothy (based on the real-life project TOTO) into the heart of a tornado.  However much of the story was about Bill and his ex, both chasers, falling back in love, another chaser who is fighting Bill for research grants and fame, and a tornado that likes to chase people.\n\n
