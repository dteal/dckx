n\nA prime number is any positive whole number greater than 1 that is only divisible by itself and 1. There are an infinite number of prime numbers, but they are somewhat elusive since there is no known function that yields all prime numbers and only prime numbers. The Riemann zeta function begins with the infinite series of 1/n^s where s is a complex number (i.e., s = x + iy where x&gt;1 and y is real and i is imaginary) and is summed from n=1 to infinity. It is then extended to be defined for all complex numbers, except s=1, by some advanced techniques.  As the image text indicates, the graph in the picture is of the Riemann-Zeta function in the complex plane. Leonhard Euler proved that there is a relationship between the Riemann-Zeta function and prime numbers, which explains Randall\'s statement of the deep ties between the two.\nHere Randall appears to be talking to his significant other, comparing her to prime numbers and himself to the Riemann-Zeta function. It is mathematically correct and quite poetic, until he mentions that his relationship differs from the comparison because "The Riemann-Zeta function couldn\'t have given you herpes." This implies that he has infected his lover with an incurable venereal disease. The comic effect of an abrupt change in tone like this is known as bathos.\nThe title text explains that Randall has forgotten the value of the complex number "s" for which he plotted the Riemann zeta function, but the "real" part (the "x" when s is written x+iy) is between 0 (the square root of 0) and +2 (the positive square root of +4), and the "imaginary" part (the "iy" when s is written x+iy) is between about 35i (the square root of -1225) and 40i (the square root of -1600).\n\n
