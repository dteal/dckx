n\nCueball wants a simple explanation so he asks Megan to "Explain it like I\'m five". "Explain like I\'m five" is a way of asking for a simpler explanation of some difficult topic. Megan applies this literally and talks to him as if he is a 5 year old child. Sarcastic simple explanations is a concept Randall has explored previously.\nMegan tells Cueball that she is working on her Thesis. A thesis consists of original research and generally deals with material that are difficult for the uninitiated to understand. Cueball anticipates that it will be difficult to understand, and asks her to "Explain like I\'m five". Megan sarcastically treats Cueball as if he is an actual 5-year-old without his parents, expressing her concern that a 5-year-old is without any supervision.\nIn the title text, Megan feigns concern that she will have to abandon her work to take care of this supposed lost child and takes this role-playing further by refusing to respond to Cueball until he phrases his comments as a 5-year-old would.\nThe common expression "Explain it like I\'m five" is inspired by a line by Groucho Marx in his movie Duck Soup. "Why a four-year-old child could understand this report! Run out and find me a four-year-old child, I can\'t make head or tail of it."[1]\n\n
