n\n"Squirrelphone" is a compound word combining "squirrel" and "phone".\nIn this comic, we see a squirrel pretend to be a telephone, only to bite Cueball who tries to pick it up and use it as one. This is humorous because a living squirrel is not an appropriate creature to maintain a phone call&#91;citation needed&#93;. This could be seen as an example of mimicry in nature, or parasitism where one creature gains a benefit from another.\nIt may be an allusion to the vampire squirrel which was documented recently that allegedly \'attacks and kills\' deer.  The comic follows the absurd conclusion that the squirrel uses mimicry to \'attack and kill\' humans.  Cueball may be lucky to still be alive.&#91;citation needed&#93;\nThe sounds the squirrel makes correspond to the tones that the terminals make when you use the POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) in the US:\n\nWhen someone else calls you and the receiver of your phone is on the hook, the phone makes loud and long "riiing riiiing" tones. This is the case in the first frame of the comic.\nWhen you pick the receiver up, the phone call is established and no extra noises are made.\nWhen no phone call is established and you pick up, a continuous humming tone is heard, meaning the service is up and you can dial someone else\'s number. (A dial tone)\nIf a phone is left off hook for too long, a loud howler-tone is played. This is to alert anyone present that the phone is off-hook. In this case, you should hang up so that you can receive calls. Once on-hook, the receiver can be picked up again to dial. Many cordless phones will also beep if left off their cradles for too long, to warn that their rechargeable batteries are getting drained.\n\nSquirrels have been used frequently in xkcd, also in what if?, where it has for instance been used as a cute animal to replace a drawing of something scary or unpleasant like in Blood Alcohol or Cannibalism. So this is some twist for the cuteness factor of squirrels in xkcd.\nIt may also be the case that "squirrelphone" is a reference to the popular web-mail software SquirrelMail.\nThe title text takes the joke further by showing the squirrel possesses another phone feature: that cordless phones need to recharge frequently, either by setting them at their cradles or by connecting them to a charger, in the case of mobile phones. When they sense the battery is low, they emit a beeping noise every few minutes. In this case, the stump is the squirrel\'s cradle.\n\n
