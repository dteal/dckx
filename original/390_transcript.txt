n\nThis comic shows Cueball\'s plight with nightmares. Since he\'s gotten used to normal nightmares, his subconscious has begun giving him dreams where he sees his loved ones imploring him to not wake up, lest they perish, as they only exist in his dream.\nThe title text continues this, with Megan claiming that she is really real, and begging Cueball to stay with her.\n\n
