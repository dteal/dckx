n\nOn Wikipedia, a well-referenced text or statement indicates credibility. References for particular facts are linked to by bracketed blue little numbers in superscript.[1][3][4] When faced with a statement followed by these, readers will normally believe it without further ado,[6][10] since they take it on trust that there are directions on the bottom of the page, leading to a reliable source or two, agreeing with what the statement says. The effect becomes strengthened when such information often is confirmed to be correct.\nIn the comic, advertisers have realized that it has gone so far that people in general will take any nonsense for granted if there is just the right amount of Wikipedia-style reference tags to it. The penis pump e-commerce can suddenly flourish (again?) and the spammers won\'t even need to bother making up findings to cite.\nTurgidax\xc2\xae is something Randall formed from turgid, meaning swollen. The reason that the attaching of -ax creates a typically pill-like name is simply that -ax (and -ex) are common Latin adjectival word endings, and that many drugs have names formed from Latin words. -Ax is also, specifically, the root of the -acious ending in English, as in "audacious" or (appropriately) bodacious, meaning "extra" or "especially". The idea is it makes the genitalius extra or especially turgid. Cardiovascular means relating to the heart and blood vessels.\nCueball saying "Sounds legit" may be a reference to the Internet meme "Seems legit", where when faced with a dubious proposal one unquestioningly accepts or agrees with it, which would make sense in this scenario.\nThe title text is about how Wikipedia users have been able to add "disputed"-tags (nowadays "disputed \xe2\x80\x93 discuss") after challenged facts, with this template, since the dawn of time.
