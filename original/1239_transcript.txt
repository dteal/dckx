n\nThis comic parodies how journalists tend to focus on social networking. Specifically in the case of revolutions, social media is given a lot of weight, even in countries with limited internet access. A direct parallel is made to the so-called Twitter Revolutions.\nOn Twitter you can send text messages with a maximum of 140 characters. This means that there could not be much content in a single post, but often many people follow the people doing these tweets. People who are not on social media tend to react like Cueball and come to the conclusion that twitter makes press coverage more stupid, just because those messages lack much detail. Cueball is also surprised about the stupidity of trying to link social media to the orbit of the asteroid \xe2\x80\x94 social media obviously have no impact on the orbit of any space objects, which are entirely driven by physics and gravitational mechanics, and are not influenced by opinions on any media.\nThe title text continues the joke. The negativity on Twitter concerning an earth bound asteroid has nothing to do with the press conference that announced it but rather with the negativity of wiping out life on earth in general. Again, journalists give undue weight to social media.\nIt\'s simply that "How has twitter affected this" has become a standard question for journalists, posed in complete disregard of the actual event.\n\n
