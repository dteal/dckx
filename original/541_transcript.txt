n\nThe comics shows Randall as a presenter at the highly prestigious TED conference, a symposium about technology, entertainment and design. The illustrious list of former presenters includes amongst others Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Larry Page, Richard Dawkins and Gordon Brown. The conference is regarded as a forum for digerati. Every talk has a length of at most 18 minutes and is supposed to be as captivating as possible.\nRandall\'s presentation, however, reduces the purpose of the conference to absurdity: The topic he wishes to point out to his listeners, is that of how to put an emoticon at the end of a parenthetical statement. This question is of little practical consequence, although it received a lot of attention after publication of the comic. In the last panel, the TED conference is another item to add to his list of conferences from which he has been banned. On the list are other conferences from all sorts of fields, including every American furry convention.\nThe title text about Randall\'s ban from the IAU conference is a reference to the popular maternal insults called "yo momma" jokes. A common representative of the genre runs "Yo mama so fat, scientists have declared her the 10th planet."\nIt can be inferred from comic 629, that Randall was banned from North American furry conventions due to being a "Skin", which is a furry whose fursona prefers going around disguised as a human.  Depending on Randall\'s behavior, such an action could generate a lot of drama and, presumably, lead to convention bans.\nGetting banned from attending a conference occurs more than once in xkcd. \n\nPyCon organizers made response to this comic - see below under PyCon response.\n\n
