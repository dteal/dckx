n\nCueball is writing a piece of code (probably in the programming language C++) which removes an item from a data structure called a Linked list (the first two lines of the text). Then, he writes a comment (which is delimited by the double slashes) relating the code to his personal life. Finally, he adds an assertion, which is normally a formal specification of a condition which should always be true (with which the programmer ensures that e.g. mass is not negative). But in this case, instead of asserting a software-related predicate, he asserts that "it\'s going to be okay" - and because of how string literals are treated by the interpreter, the assertion will be true.\nAn "assert" is a programming statement that allows you to insert sanity checks into your code. For example, if you were writing a program to calculate the speed of a neutrino, then at the end of the calculation you could say:  \n\nassert ( velocity_of_neutrino &lt;= speed_of_light );\n\nIf the assertion fails, then the program will stop with an error. This would be much better than publishing an embarrassing paper, for example. \nThe title text explains that assertion in question fails: we cannot be sure that things are going to be ok.\n\n
