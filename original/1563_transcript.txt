n\nThis comic shows several "Synonym Movies". It takes several well known movies, but changes each word of their names into a synonym. So Star Wars has turned into Space Fights, The Lord of the Rings into  The Jewelry God and Star Trek into Space Trip. All these movies series have the same heading, and then a subtitle. There are ten of them in the comic, and two more in the title text.\nThe use of synonyms makes all these movies look ridiculous, for example, "The Sword Wizard Is Back" is a laughable sounding movie&#91;citation needed&#93;, whereas "Return of the Jedi" sound perfectly reasonable to us. Randall may be poking fun at movies that have ridiculous titles already, for instance some people think this applies to a title like "Terminator: Genisys".\nThe title text refers to the latest Star Wars movie (2015-12-18), after Disney acquired the movie rights. The movie is called Star Wars: The Force Awakens and has now turned into Power Gets Up. As usual, with any Star Wars related material, there is a huge fan base that eagerly awaits the new movie. But then again many people fear that it will not live up to their expectations, as was the case with the fourth movie, first of the three movies in the second installment of Star Wars, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, dubbed here as The Scary Ghost. As mentioned in the title text, that movie did not live up to the hype.\nA similarly humourous effect is achieved in 1133: Up Goer Five which explains the Saturn V rocket, but words and phrases are replaced with synonyms which are chosen from the most common English words. This renders ordinary words like "rocket" into "flying space car", or "helium" into "funny voice air" for example.\nSee also 1568: Synonym Movies 2.\n\n
