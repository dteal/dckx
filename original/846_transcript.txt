n\nKe$ha is a pop/rap singer, and this strip refers to her 2009-10 hit single "Tik Tok." The song begins with the following lyrics, of which the title text is a parody:\n\nWake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy\nGrab my glasses, I\'m out the door, I\'m gonna hit this city\nBefore I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack\n\'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain\'t coming back.\n\nA "bottle of Jack" refers to the Jack Daniel\'s brand of whiskey.\nThe strip depicts Megan warning Ke$ha not to neglect dental hygiene by using whiskey instead of toothpaste to freshen her breath, due to the severe pain that could result if she let the nerves in her teeth become infected. The title text displays dental-hygiene-friendly lyrics, with emphasis on certain syllables (as all-caps) to imitate the rhythm of the original song.\n\n
