n\nThis comic purports to finally answer the question, "What does \'xkcd\' mean?" However, instead of giving an answer as to what the letters actually mean (according to Randall, it\'s literally "just a word with no phonetic pronunciation"), he offers five quirky behaviors. This is reminiscent of TV commercials that ask, "What does [brand name] mean? It means [happy activity]!".\nThe first panel shows a driver making a right turn at a red light, a U-turn on the connecting road, and then another right turn, returning them to their original direction presumably faster than waiting for the light. Right turns at red lights and U-turns are legal in some states and at some intersections, but not always, hence this complicated maneuver is "questionably legal".\nThe second panel shows Cueball searching for his mobile phone by having his friend call it to locate the ringtone, only to hear a ring from inside of his dog\'s stomach.\nIn the third panel, Graham\'s number is a (very) large number (once celebrated as the largest number ever used in a proof, although it is no longer the record holder), and the Ackermann function is a (very) fast-growing function, thus the function\'s output must be insanely large. (In fact, A(g64, g64) is actually smaller than g65.)\nThe fourth panel shows somebody walking in a pattern based on the position of black and white tiles on the floor. This is further referenced in 245: Floor Tiles.\nThe title text refer to stigmata, marks corresponding to Jesus\' crucifixion wounds. Devout Catholics have claimed to have spontaneously developed stigmata.\n\n
