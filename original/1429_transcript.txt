n\n"Kirk vs. Picard" is a debate that many Star Trek fans engage in \xe2\x80\x94 specifically which was a better captain of the starship Enterprise on the TV show. Captain James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard each were captains of the ship in different periods (Kirk was captain of USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) in The Original Series, while Picard was captain of USS Enterprise-D (NCC-1701-D) in The Next Generation), but fans argue over who was the "best". Most third-place candidates are pretty distant, resulting in a more multi-faceted debate. Cueball seems to be looking at results of polling for this third most popular character.\nThe humor in this comic stems from the fact that the Latin word data is a plural form of the word datum, and that originally English followed Latin\'s lead and treated data as plural. However, in more recent English, usage of datum has faded to the extent that data is treated as a collective noun. This usage is becoming increasingly (but not universally) accepted as grammatically correct \xe2\x80\x94 the Wall Street Journal, for instance, recently announced that it is moving away from saying "data are," while the New York Times\' manual of style allows for both variants depending on usage scenario; USA Today, however, is consistently using data as a plural ("data are"). Naturally, the purists insist on the form that is correct from the Latin grammar point of view and see "data is" as an example of a subject-verb agreement error. This type of "error" is present in the beginning of the sentence that Cueball is citing ("According to this polling data," while certain traditionalists would hold that the grammatically correct variant would be "According to these polling data").\nThe second error in the same sentence is due to the fact that Data is a character from Star Trek: The Next Generation. Since it is a character\'s name, when used to refer to the character, "Data" should always be treated as singular.\nBy reversing the verb agreement in both cases, Cueball is going out of his way to annoy grammatically obsessed people.\nThe title text suggests the mocking of language pedants/amateur grammar Nazis by hypercorrecting one\'s use of language. The sentence itself is an example of this:\n\nThe general rule is that words starting with a consonant should be preceded by a, while words starting with a vowel should be preceded by an. However,\nThe letter h is a special case, since in words like honor (/\xcb\x88\xc9\x92n\xc9\x99\xc9\xb9/) and hour (/\xcb\x88a\xca\x8a\xc9\x99\xc9\xb9/) the h is silent so the words actually start with a vowel sound, thus leading to the use of an. \nBeyond this, there is a longstanding controversy over whether to use a or an with words that in some accents start with a silent h and in others they don\'t (see Straightdope). The Oxford Learner\'s Dictionary says about historical: Some speakers do not pronounce the \xe2\x80\x98h\xe2\x80\x99 at the beginning of historical and use \xe2\x80\x98an\xe2\x80\x99 instead of \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99 before it. This now sounds old-fashioned.\nIn the title text Randall adds the word hypercorrection to the list that includes historical and history. In this invented accent, the pronunciation would be "ypercorrection".\n\nThis comic complements two of the My Hobbies comics 326: Effect an Effect (which discusses the trolling of amateur grammar Nazis) and 1405: Meteor (which mocks pedantry). This comic could also just as well have been labelled as one of Randall\'s Hobbies.\nThis comic also appears to be an example of self-irony as the author himself has previously exhibited certain inclination to insist on grammatically strict mode of usage of words loaned from Latin. One such example is the fact that xkcd\'s online discussion forums are called fora, which is a correct plural nominative form of forum in Latin.\n\n
