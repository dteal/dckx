n\nHere we have Cueball and Megan discussing geology and the words they use are ripe with puns and double entendres which also have sexual meanings. In the end they just decide to get it on.\nSpecifically, the suggestive terms are "bedding," "spreading," "friction," "cleavage," "deeper in the rift," "orogeny," (perhaps a pun on orgy and erogenous), "huge," and "thrust."\nIn the title text, gneiss (pronounced "nice") is a type of rock, and butte (rhymes with "cute") is a conspicuous isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top. "Gneiss butte" is a play on "nice butt".\n\n
