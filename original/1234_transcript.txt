n\nThe comic describes and references The Mother of All Demos in honor of Douglas Engelbart, who died on July 2, 2013.\nThe demo is renowned for the numerous technologies Douglas\' team introduced, which the comic references before sliding into apocryphal claims. At the first panel he presents various inventions, including the Computer Mouse. The second panel contains the opening lyrics of Leonard Cohen\'s song Hallelujah. The "Secret Chord" is a reference to his "Chord Key Set" he also presented at this demo. This relatively obscure device, essentially a piano with five keys, was meant as an alternative to the well-known keyboard. The third is a reference to contemporary internet memes, specifically cat pictures and YOLO.\nThe title text is a reference to recent revelations about spying by the United States National Security Agency, which was making headlines when this comic was published.\n\n
