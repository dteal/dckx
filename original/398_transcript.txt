n\nThis comic uses verbal irony to exploit the application of double meanings. The phrase "tap that ass" is a colloquialism for "to have intercourse with that person" and is most likely how the reader expects the phrase to be used. However, throughout the comic, this is not the case.\nIn the first panel, it is possible that Cueball is using "tap that ass" sexually. However, it is more likely that he is using "tap" to mean "pick" or "choose", in which case he would be the one choosing the next committee chair. "That ass" refers to one of the individuals in the meeting room to be picked for the position.\nIn the second panel, "tap" is referring to wiretapping. The Cueball character with the headphones on has just unplugged his headphone. This suggests he and his colleague at the phone were just done with the wiretapping. In this scenario it is strange that the colleague is still on the phone instead of hanging up. However, it would be much stranger to wiretap someone in plain eyesight unless that person is blind. "Ass" likely refers to the person they have just wiretapped. Cueball says he\'d tap that ass "without a warrant", suggesting that they had one in this situation.\nIn the third panel, "tap" is referring to extracting sap from trees. A sexual connotation would make no sense in this context. "That ass" refers to the maple tree.\nIn the final panel, Cueball has a chance to now use the phrase "tap that ass" to mean "having intercourse". The punchline is that he does not do so and instead explicitly states he\'d have sex with a tree.\nThe title text features a request from Cueball from the last panel to Cueball from the third panel. He asks Cueball not to plug up the hole left behind from tapping the tree, so he can have sex with it.\n\n
