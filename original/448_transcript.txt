n\nBoth characters have irregular sleeping schedules (possibly because they are programmers). As such, their circadian rhythms have become out of sync with one another, and probably out of sync with everyone else in their own timezone. They therefore experience something similar to the "jet lag" experience by travelers going from one timezone to another.\nThe title text clarifies that they are using "going to sleep at midnight and waking up at 8 AM" as their standard of measurement. If the drowsy man was "in Honolulu" yesterday and has woken up "in Taipei", it means he has gone to sleep 6 hours later than yesterday, and is now also waking up 6 hours later than yesterday (if you don\'t take the International Date Line into consideration).\nThis comic may (like in 320) be a commentary of the 28 hour day where a person shift their sleep patterns to 6 x 28 hours a week instead of the usual 7 x 24 hours.\n\n
