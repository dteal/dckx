n\nThis comic is a take on the common and cliched job interview question here asked by Hairbun: Where do you see yourself in 5 years. The interviewer is attempting to see where the job seeker would like to take their career and also what their hopes and dreams are etc.\nIn the comic, instead of explaining where he would like to be in 5 years, Beret Guy and the interviewer wait around for 5 years without moving to find out. And as Beret Guy expected they stayed exactly where they were. (This could be suggesting that most people do not change much over five years.)\nThe title text is a continuation of their conversation in which Beret Guy turns down the job because he wants to find out what happened the last 5 years while they were both sitting in that room.\nGiven Beret Guy\'s ability to manipulate reality (1099: Tuesdays), it\'s possible he froze himself and the interviewer for 5 years.\nOther job interviews were portrayed in 125: Marketing Interview, 1094: Interview, 1293: Job Interview and 1545: Strengths and Weaknesses.\n\n
