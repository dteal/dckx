n\nListen to the music.\nA member of a marching band, after spending seasons marching in time to their music for their shows, ends up naturally walking with the rhythm of any music they hear around them, like at a shopping mall. Pausing the music for a split second would throw off the rhythm, supposedly enough to cause them to fall. The line of music in the comic is a piano reduction of the beginning of Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley, a reference to the internet phenomenon of Rickrolling, a form of bait-and-switch in which a link that appears to point to something else instead links to Rick Astley\'s song.\nThe title text refers to the fact that almost all marching bands start marching with the left foot, so marching band members tend to naturally start with the left foot.\n\n
