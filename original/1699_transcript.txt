n\nTypical news broadcasts are divided into local, national, and global news segments. The broadcast in this comic presented by Blondie, the news anchor, has been broken into real local, (about city council election) and what the newscaster calls "nonlocal". Rather than focusing on national or global news, the nonlocal segment deals with news of a nonlocality nature; more likely dealing with causal nonlocality.\nA "tachyon" is a theoretical or thought-experiment particle which travels faster than the speed of light. It has many strange properties, including being able to go back in time. This is how the newscaster is able to send a beam back in time to kill her past self. The comic does not explain the paradox of how someone who died in the past could still be alive in the present/future, nor any of the many other paradoxes that arise with time travel is involved, a recurring theme in xkcd.\nThe title text asks if there could ever be a greater physics term than tachyonic antitelephone? It is a theoretical device which would allow messages to be sent to the past. The text then continues to answer the question via a message from the future (presumably sent by antitelephone). The answer is No - there will never be a greater physics term.\n\n
