n\nPandora is a website which automatically plays songs of a certain genre based upon the user\'s previous musical selections. Unlike normal radio, it adapts itself to each individual user\'s preferences, producing playlists that the user will find enjoyable. In other words, Pandora plays music you like.\nOne may not want friends to find out that one enjoys certain songs and/or certain kinds of songs ("embarrassing music"), for fear of looking childish, sentimental, etc. A recent example is the soundtrack to the 2013 film Frozen: although enjoying popularity and critical acclaim, it is considered by many to be embarrassing music, because they do not want others to know that they like a soundtrack to a Disney animated film.\nOne certainly does not want one\'s embarrassing music to be played on Pandora when others are around. The frequency of this depends on individual circumstances, but generally one\'s embarrassing music is a small fraction of all music one likes. However, due to biased memory, people remember cases where embarrassing music is played in others\' presence far better than those where "acceptable music" is played. So it appears that when others are around Pandora only plays embarrassing music.\nThe title text presents an example of this, the music in question being the soundtrack to Enchanted, a fantasy romantic comedy film produced by Walt Disney Pictures.\n\n
