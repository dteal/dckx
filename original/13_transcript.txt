n\nThis is one of the early comics which explores a theme xkcd returns to often: the wonder around us, if we would just look. \nCueball and his friend (who also looks like Cueball), are having a discussion. After the friend asks Cueball what the time is, Cueball simply states that it is now. Then there is a beat panel showing the two standing at the lip of a great canyon drawn in detail and color. \nThe friend claims that now is a boring answer, since it\'s a tautology, a functionally useless answer, and a bad joke all at the same time. Cueball, however, asserts that now is the least boring answer he could give.\nIt is typical for human beings to focus on mundane concerns, like a meeting they might be late for or a bus they have to catch, and take their familiar environment for granted, no matter how fabulous it might have been at first sight.\nThe title text explains that they stand on the lip of the canyon, which may not be clear if you do not look very carefully at the color drawing. There are two tiny stick figures at the top of the canyon, near the center of the panel.  On the other six panels there is just a ragged line, which thus obviously is this lip of the canyon.\n\n
