n\nFor most people, under most circumstances, a flashlight\'s water-resistance is a completely moot point, as most flashlight use occurs on dry land. But, as Randall has shown before, there is a tendency for people to imagine elaborate scenarios in which an extra edge would be useful.\nIn the dream sequence over the first 2 and a half frames, Cueball appears to be diving to find a key underwater, which he spots using his flashlight when he is at 8 meters. His flashlight goes out at 10 meters because he bought the "Hi-Brite" model. The dream sequence also references a "radio shed", which were only really used in the past for amateur radios or some other military style bases/compounds\xe2\x80\x94which would align with his "warn the President" line.\nThe title text takes Cueball\'s thought process to the next level. If he is getting a flashlight that works to 40 meters (worst-case), he should probably be prepared for even deeper waters as well (even worse-case). However, this is seen as ridiculous from his friend, since the more durable model costs $25 more in return. However, he replies that you never know what situation you\'d be in.\n\n
