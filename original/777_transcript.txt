n\nThis comic shows a box of "Deep-cleaning pore strips," which are a skin-care product designed to clean your pores. You stick them on your face, wait a while, and then rip them off. When they come off, a whole lot of disgusting gunk from out of your pores comes off with them. The kind shown in the comic, however, is super-deep cleaning, and rips out not only the user\'s pore gunk, but also his entire skull.\nThe title text indicates that while Randall is aware that pore-cleaning strips are useless and possibly harmful products created to make money by "solving" something that isn\'t actually a problem, they are quite effective at getting things out of the pores on a person\'s nose.\n\n
