n\nCueball is a news anchor reporting on a hurricane.\nFirst some definitions, NHC is the National Hurricane Center and the APA is American Psychological Association.\nThe reference to Piaget Stage 5 in the comic is a reference to Piaget\'s Stages of Development in which stage 5 is where (to quote Wikipedia and Gruber, H.E.; Voneche, J.J.. eds. The essential Piaget.)\n\n"Infants become intrigued by the many properties of objects and by the many things they can make happen to objects; they experiment with new behavior." This stage is associated primarily with the discovery of new means to meet goals. Piaget describes the child at this juncture as the "young scientist," conducting pseudo-experiments to discover new methods of meeting challenges."\n\nWhich is exactly what the comic is describing in sustained interest in objects and their properties and the handy "?"s around the picture behind the newscaster in this comic.\nSo, with all that out of the way, this comic is a pun on the classification of hurricanes which are also classified in categories from 1 to 5. Piaget\'s Stages go from 1-6. The comic is making a joke that if the APA were on hurricane forecast duty instead of the NHC, that the hurricanes would be classified with Piaget\'s stages instead of categories.\n\n
