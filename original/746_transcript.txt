n\nThis comic is a parody of the studies and news stories about the effects of video games, especially Grand Theft Auto (GTA), on children\nIn this comic, we see a scene of a woman giving birth. Instead of the normal birth we would expect, a baby\'s head and a gun emerge. The baby, who can already talk, attempts to rob the doctor saying, "Nobody move-this is a stick-up!" as is typical in movie robberies.\nThe title text explains the comic by explaining that the baby learned this bad behavior because his or her mother played the video game Grand Theft Auto too frequently, as some people believe that if children play too many violent video games they act like the video games in real life. Grand Theft Auto has been criticized and publicly blamed for its potential to encouraging violent behavior in children. This comic hyperbolizes this idea by imagining what effects video games would have on an unborn baby.\nThis is one of the few comics that features Megan\'s name in the text.\n\n
