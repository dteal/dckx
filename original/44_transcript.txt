n\nThis comic expresses the view of a love that is unbalanced and unequal. And how one form of love can be painful when closely examined.\nInstead of continuing Cueball\'s escalation by saying the expected response "I love you more!" Megan stops and agrees with him: he does love her more than she loves him. The final frame shows the couple standing in silence.\nIn the title text, Randall expresses how this comic is shockingly stark in its portrayal of love.\n\n
