n\nGoogle Maps is a web mapping service application. Before smartphones with GPS mapping software were widespread and most people\'s printers hadn\'t yet run out of ink, it was common to print out directions to take with you on a trip. The web version of Google Maps has many features including a route planner. As sophisticated as early versions were, it occasionally gave suboptimal directions. For example, the directions may tell you to take an exit that, in reality, is unmarked. Directions also did not take time of day into account which would help in planning routes to avoid traffic or to make use of services such as a ferry.\nThe title text tells us that Cueball and his brother attempted to drive around the lake since they could not take the ferry and had an unfortunate run-in with the Straw Man (apparently waking him as the directions warned against).\nThough no specific game or movie is referenced, steps 75 to 81 of the directions read like the plot of a horror film, a guide of a video game, or a role playing game. A straw man is another term for scarecrow, a common antagonist in both. Step 80 reads exactly like an old text adventure game\'s description of an area.\nThere are additional small jokes in the distance column of the directions:\n\nStep 75 tells you to travel 1172 feet up, a direction that Google Maps doesn\'t normally take into account.\nNo distance is traveled in step 77, so Google instead tells you to be careful when talking to Charlie.\nPi is a ratio usually used in calculations involving circles, rather than in measuring distances.\nGoogle doesn\'t know how far it is from the Spectral Wolf to your destination, so it gives you question marks as the distance.\n\nThis might be a reference to Google Maps\' many easter eggs.\n\n
