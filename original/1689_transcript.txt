n\nThis is another comic using substitutions to create the joke by replacing words or phrases, in this case "My cat", with a different word or phrase, in this case "My friend Catherine" (hence the title). The choice of the name is probably because "Kat" is a common nickname for "Catherine".\nBy doing so in a list of people discussing things their cat did, it makes it seem like they are discussing things their female human friend did.  What is cute (sitting on keyboards), impressive (doing backflips to eat bugs), or at least normal behavior for a cat (vomiting hairballs) would often be weird, disgusting or disturbing if an adult human were to do it, which is what makes the substitution humorous.\nThe comic depicts a feed on a page for people discussing their cat, similar to Twitter or Facebook, which would be the only kind of place where the substitution is really funny. Apart from known characters like two looking like Cueball, Megan and Ponytail, there is also a person with black hair, not looking particularly like any standard characters, and then a person with a knit cap, which could be the same knit cap wearing user that was also used in 1506: xkcloud (see the  pictures of the users).\nIn the title text there is another cat related status update regarding a cat sitting on a keyboard. Given the fact that one of the earlier substitution comics from before the three Substitution comics, was 1031: s/keyboard/leopard/ that replaced keyboard with leopard, many fans of xkcd were a little disappointed that the title text did not read: I can\'t get any work done because my friend Catherine is sitting on my leopard.\n\n
