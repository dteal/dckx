n\nIn many English speaking countries, including the US, when someone presents the other with bad news, they respond with a sympathetic "I\'m sorry". That is different from the apologetic "I\'m sorry" that a person would give for something that is their fault. Some people, however, choose to be pedantic and refuse to accept the phrase, since the other person isn\'t guilty of anything. This can be annoying to people who view it as a common phrase which should be accepted as a normal idiosyncrasy of the language.\nAs it says below the comic, Cueball switches his sympathetic "I\'m sorry" when Megan, being pedantic, does not accept the "I\'m sorry" because it was not his fault. Instead of agreeing with her, Cueball says "I know what I did...", implying that he DID, in fact, burn down her mother\'s house, an act which she would not expect.\nAt the title text, "You know I\'ve always hated her." is an explanation for burning down the house, albeit an insufficient one. It is unlikely that he actually burned her house down, but rather is simply teaching Megan a lesson not to nitpick so much.\n\n
