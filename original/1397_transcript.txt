n\nThis comic takes place in a scene from the third theatrically-released Star Wars movie, Return of the Jedi, wherein Darth Vader confronts his son, Luke Skywalker, who had recently surrendered to Imperial soldiers. In the movie Vader notes that Luke Skywalker has constructed a new lightsaber following the loss of his original during their duel on Cloud City, Luke Skywalker\'s original lightsaber actually having been Anakin Skywalker\'s second lightsaber, Anakin who later turned into Darth Vader. \nIn this comic, however, Darth Vader has accidentally discovered his son\'s Fleshlight (a male sex toy designed to imitate one of various orifices, most commonly a vagina), which he apparently brought with him on the attack on the Forest Moon of Endor. From a certain angle, a Fleshlight could be mistaken for the handle of a lightsaber, without the blade extended. Like many children, Luke Skywalker is attempting to hide evidence of his sexual activity from a parent. References to Fleshlight is a recurring theme in xkcd.\nThe title text refers to the fact that if Darth Vader turned the Fleshlight on, instead of creating a blade of pure plasma or energy suspended in a force containment field the device would simply vibrate, revealing it for what it really is. Randall is also punning on "being turned on" as slang for being sexually aroused.\nIn 1637: Salt Mine, Ponytail makes a very similar remark to the one that Luke makes here.\n\n
