n\nCarl Sagan was an advocate for science, space and SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence). He wrote the book Contact, which was later made into the movie by the same name. While Sagan did not emit anomalous radiation in his lifetime &#91;citation needed&#93;, he did receive acclaim in the field of radiology, namely for using radiation to synthesize amino acids from simpler chemicals.\nThis comic is parodying Spider-Man, in which Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider to become Spider-Man. In this comic "a radioactive Carl Sagan" turns the person into "Sagan-Man". Apparently, Sagan-Man is able to stop thieves in their tracks by blowing their minds with inspiring scientific facts.\nThe title text implies that Sagan-Man\'s vivid imagery inspires the entire "criminal class" to give up their anti-social ways and turn to space research.\n\n
