n\nRandall points out the Virginia creeper is a plant with 5 green leaves that can be used as a rope. He then points out that poison ivy is another vine like plant with 3 green leaves that also grows near camping areas - but causes skin rashes. His girlfriend is into light bondage (being tied up for erotic purposes) Yet the area around their tent was too dark to differentiate between the two vines when he went looking for some impromptu rope. \nThe implication: Either Randall, his girlfriend, or both spent some time that night wrapped in poison ivy. The resulting painful rashes were likely blamed on Randall for harvesting the wrong plant, and the relationship suffered.\nThe title text refers to the fact that many modern tents are self-supporting and no longer require rope to put up, which would have avoided the need to look for vines.\n\n
