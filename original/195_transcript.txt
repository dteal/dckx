n\nOn the map, all allocated IPv4 address blocks (as of 2006) are shown using a fractal mapping. (The Hilbert curve is used: the pattern is demonstrated at the bottom of the image.) In February 2011, the final remaining IPv4 blocks were allocated to the Regional Internet registries, and so today there would no longer be any green spaces outside of Class E addresses (above 240 through 255, excluding the Broadcast address of 255.255.255.255).\nIn the early 1990s corporations and governments could register an entire class A segment (one 256th of the total space) but later it was divided into smaller parts because lack of space.\nThis leads to the title text, which mentions IPv6. This protocol has so many addresses that only a swarm of nanobots could exhaust them (see 865: Nanobots). The default desktop picture in Windows XP is a green landscape, and the joke is that since barely any of the addresses are allocated yet, the IPv6 map would just be a green landscape.\nLater Randall actually drew some "real" maps of the internet, or at least its online Communities (see 256: Online Communities and 802: Online Communities 2).\n\n
