n\nIn the first panel, Cueball proposes to a woman. While he does this, a narrator (most likely the man\'s inner voice) explains why he wants to marry her. He says that he realizes that there is no choir of trumpeting angels when you meet the right girl. And that he must overcome his fears and doubts to realize that the woman he\'s with is perfect for him, and that she is \'the one\'.\nIn the second panel, they get married. And in the third panel, after they are married, Megan comes in saying \'Hi\'.\nAnd then Cueball has the full \'love at first sight\'-experience. He sees a choir of angels, and they are trumpeting and all. She is definitely the \'one\' he was looking for all the time.\nSo he realizes that his theory he had when he got married, is false. And that his true love is standing in front of him, and is not the one he married. A difficult situation, he doesn\'t know how to react or what to do at all. And this is expressed by him just thinking in his head \'Well, shit.\' (What now?). \nThe title text notes that the last guy who had a similar experience fell in love with one of the angels instead, not realising that it was the girl he just met that was the love of his life. Which is of course much worse, especially because the angels are transient, and the only way to see them again is by meeting the perfect \'girl\' and he has just ignored her!\nThe comic 584: Unsatisfied could be seen as a continuation of this - with the blond girl being depicted as Ponytail.\n\n
