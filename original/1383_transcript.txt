n\nTypically the term "foot fetish" refers to a sexual attraction to people\'s feet. Here, though, Megan is a linguist, so for her the term "foot" refers not to the body part but to the term\'s meaning in prosody. In this context, "foot" means, per Wikipedia, "the basic metrical unit that generates a line of verse in most Western traditions of poetry," and thus "foot fetish" means an attraction to words that follow such a format.\nCommon types of feet (which are all referenced in this comic) include\n\ntrochee \xe2\x80\x93 a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable (demonstrated in the first set of words: "sto-ry", "wa-ter", "pa-per", "door-way") (see also 856: Trochee Fixation).\niamb \xe2\x80\x93 an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable (as seen in the second set: "dis-arm", "A-dele\'s", "gi-raffe", "gre-nade") (perhaps the best-known foot, due to its use by William Shakespeare) (see also 79: Iambic Pentameter).\ndactyl \xe2\x80\x93 a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables (used in the third set: "straw-ber-ry", "scor-pi-on", "po-et-ry").\nanapest \xe2\x80\x93 (referenced in the title text) two unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable; it is thus the reverse of a dactyl (see the discussion section). Note that the word anapest, pronounced "ANN-a-pest,"[1][2][3] is itself a dactyl, not an anapest, because the stress is on the first syllable. So it is an instance of a heterological word.\n\nMegan thus wishes that Cueball first use a trochee during foreplay, then switch to an iamb during her main stimulation phase (intercourse or some other type that still enables Cueball to speak freely), and finally switch to a dactyl as she orgasms. According to the title text, after sex she wishes for him to hold her while he whispers the word "anapest" in her ear. But for a linguist like Megan, this is just four different types of "foot" stimulation - thus she can be called a woman with a foot fetish.\n\n
