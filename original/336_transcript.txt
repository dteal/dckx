n\nIn some schools in the United States, a student\'s grades are determined mainly using letters for quick reference.&#91;citation needed&#93; In this case:\n\nA \xe2\x80\x94 100%\xe2\x80\x9390%\nB \xe2\x80\x94 89%\xe2\x80\x9380%\nC \xe2\x80\x94 79%\xe2\x80\x9370%\nD \xe2\x80\x94 69%\xe2\x80\x9360%\nF \xe2\x80\x94 59%\xe2\x80\x930%\n\n\nTraditionally, these schools send \'report cards\' in which the student\'s current grading of the semester or even the entirety of the class the student is taking is denoted using these letters, for example:\n\nEnglish \xe2\x80\x94 A\nMathematics \xe2\x80\x94 A\nScience \xe2\x80\x94 A\nSocial Studies \xe2\x80\x94 A\nWorld Building \xe2\x80\x94 A\n\n\nThe student may have noted that, if he aims for certain scoring (for example: altering the quality of his homework or even sending out his homework only at the times needed for his grades to reach a certain level), he could make the report card spell every letter grade in alphabetical order. Deriving from the previous example, the student would aim for the following report card:\n\nEnglish \xe2\x80\x94 A\nMathematics \xe2\x80\x94 B\nScience \xe2\x80\x94 C\nSocial Studies \xe2\x80\x94 D\nWorld Building \xe2\x80\x94 F\n\n\nInterestingly, since even a 0% grade would mark the required \'F\' grade, the student does not need to work at all (not even send out a school assignment) to get the required \'F\' grade, this leading to the situation presented in the comic above.\nThe title text references that, not only can the grades in the report card inadvertently spell out certain words (for example: \'CAB\' or \'FAD\'), but also that the letter grade system denoted omits the letter \'E\' in standard letter grading. The reason for the missing "E" is complex and explained at this Slate article\n\n
