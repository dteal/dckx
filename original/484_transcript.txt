n\nDedicated hardcore gamers will often indulge in expensive, top-of-the-line equipment to get the most out of their video games. \nAdobe Flash is a software platform allowing multimedia applications in the browser. Flash became a popular choice for game developers, since playing Flash games only requires a browser and the free cross-platform Flash runtime environment. Randall is right that Flash games are quite addictive, and gamers may find them more engaging than anything that runs on expensive (dedicated) gaming systems.\nNowadays, eight years after the making of this comic, Flash has been mostly phased out by modern browsers in favor of HTML5 + JavaScript. The open-source movement especially prefers the latter, since no proprietary browser plugins are needed to run it. That said, the sheer number of Flash games that have been made over the last decade means that Flash will likely hold a special place in many gamers\' hearts for the foreseeable future, to the point where "Flash game" has become a catch-all term for any Browser game.\nThe comic may also be commenting that some modern games are too focused on graphics and not enough on gameplay.\nThe title-text mentions the Wiimote, the standard controller for the Nintendo Wii video game console. Wii games are usually controlled by tracking the movement and orientation of the handheld Wiimote, but Johnny Lee devised a method to use a Wiimote to track the position of the users head and demonstrated this with a desktop VR display. It should be noted that this is not the same as the body-tracking that is available from Sony and Microsoft with the EyeToy and Kinect respectively, neither of which has earned any real praise as a practical gaming controller.\n\n
