n\nWhen faced with the question "Will you marry me?", Cueball approaches the question in an empirical way. The word empirical denotes information gained by means of direct observation or experiments. In this comic, Cueball completes the "Will you marry me?" experiment, by actually getting married (as opposed to deciding on the spot or taking time to think) and the results are "yes".\nThe word "will" has two meanings: auxiliary verb of the future and disposition to do something. In the first sense Cueball cannot answer this question since he cannot know the future. Of course the question Will you marry me? uses the verb will in the second sense.\nThis comic is likely a reference to Randall\'s marriage around this time.\n\n
