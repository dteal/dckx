n\nSimilar to the "My Hobby" series, this comic depicts one of Randall\'s goals in life: He wants to hire Academy-Award-winning actor Jeremy Irons to deliver all of Randall\'s dialogue in life (while Randall, perhaps, lip syncs it). He is apparently basing this desire on the fact that Irons, a classically trained English actor, portrayed Scar, the main antagonist in the 1994 Disney animated feature The Lion King.\nThe line that is spoken in the comic is from the song "Be Prepared" which Scar sings in the film. Thus, it\'s not entirely clear whether Randall enjoys Irons\'s deep, rumbling British-accented voice, or whether it\'s Scar\'s dialogue in the film that Randall truly would like to be speaking.\nThe title text suggests that Randall knows the dialogue of The Lion King from memory; it also suggests there are others he knows as well. He is around the appropriate age to have been in the target market for the film (he would have been around 10 at the time) and probably saw it many times.\n\n
