n\nIn this comic, White Hat is pointing out to Cueball that his obsession with efficiency is inconsistent, something that is likely true of many people who claim to prize efficiency.\nHere, Cueball raves about his new mobile keyboard which allows him to type 30% faster than his old keyboard. He notes that people (presumably himself particularly) do a lot of mobile typing, and a 30% reduction in the time that takes would allow more time for other activities.\nWhite Hat, on the other hand, mocks Cueball for caring so much about mobile typing speed, suggesting that this may not be the first time Cueball has obsessed over minor improvements in efficiency. White Hat also notes that he\'s just seen Cueball open and close Google News five times without reading anything, providing an example of how Cueball\'s other actions do not embody the same commitment to efficiency that he claims to have.\nCueball defends himself by saying that, since he wastes so much time, it\'s that much more important to improve efficiency in his life to make more time for important matters. The title text (presumably White Hat\'s reply) counters this defense by suggesting that Cueball may be better off using a slower keyboard, so that he will have less time to waste on stupid activities. This type of argument may be an example of a logical fallacy argument which suggests, perhaps incorrectly, that Cueball should spend less time doing stupid things to the extent that he spends longer doing things he already does.\nInterestingly, in this comic, White Hat appears as the voice of reason to Cueball, an inversion of their typical dynamic (see for instance 1386: People are Stupid and 1459: Documents). The role-reversal may be an acknowledgment that while Cueball may often make a fool of White Hat, he\'s far from perfect himself.\nRandall\'s misadventures in time management are a recurring topic (see 874: Time Management and the Time management category).\nMobile keyboard efficiency was previously tangentially referenced in 1068: Swiftkey, and Randall\'s habit of opening news sites only to quickly get bored or distracted was shown in 1411: Loop.\n\n
