n\nWhenever something big happens the news media likes to have at least two things: interviews with people that are the news, and on-the-scene reporters. In this case Blondie as a news anchor is shown to begin with talking about Black Hat and she has even been out at his hose. Even if those reporters are simply standing in front of a building that something happened in, they have to be on-scene. To thwart the media (and probably everyone else), Black Hat has built a moat around his apartment building. The second reporter is on-the-scene from the Internet, or rather, one of its darkest corners: 4chan. In more detail, 4chan is a collection of image boards, which act somewhat like forums, where users go to share images. The different boards are named by their "folder" structure, for lack of a better term. Therefore, the name /b/ comes from its URL: 4chan.org/b/. Pronounced "slash bee" (because the second forward slash is not necessary), /b/ is the "random" board, where anything goes, where anything is the superset of all sets, as in anything. Absolutely. Anything. As in, going more than two seconds without seeing pornographic content or hateful slurs is almost unheard of. /b/ is also the one that gets the most publicity, because it has started most of the memes [1] on the Internet, as well as the birthplace of Anonymous. The chaotic nature of the forums explains why the title text suggests that the reporter isn\'t safe, even though he is wearing a helmet. In fact, a goofy helmet like that is liable to get the trolls on him faster than if he didn\'t have it.\nRon Paul is a man who is currently a U.S. Representative for Texas. At the time the comic was published, he was running, for the second time, for President of the United States.\nA haberdasher is a person who sells small articles of clothing that have been or can be sewed. In modern English a haberdashery (where a haberdasher would work) is a place that sells hats.\nRon Paul\'s 2008 presidential campaign did, in fact, use a blimp which was named the Ron Paul Blimp. However, despite their elegant appearance, blimps are not a very fast way to travel.\nThe images on the board behind the reporter are: The Fonz, /b/, a CD, and Epic Fail Guy, spelling out ABCDEFG.\nThe title text states that the second reporter (Tom)\'s helmet won\'t help him, though from what, it is unclear as he himself stated he wasn\'t sure why he was wearing the helmet.\nAll comics in the Secretary series:\n\n494: Secretary: Part 1\n495: Secretary: Part 2 (this one)\n496: Secretary: Part 3\n497: Secretary: Part 4\n498: Secretary: Part 5\n\nThis series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.\n\n
