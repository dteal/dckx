n\nHere, Cueball is commenting in a comment thread that he authored about the negative traits of DRM, or again, Digital Rights Management (also known under \'Digital Restrictions Management\'). Cueball has a point: DRM, while meant to fight those who download media through \'dungeon sketchy\' maneuvers, risks locking out legitimate owners. In turn, this turns off legitimate buyers from buying the songs, thus hurting artists.\nOf course, this would be true if the major stores sell music with DRM. Megan, wanting Cueball to make peace and enjoy his goal, makes the following choice quote: \'Close the comment thread, get out the debit card, buy us some music, and let\'s rock the fuck out\', while she shows the sign of the horns.\nThe problem is that fighting feels good, something that does not usually require money from the participants.\nThe title text references 132: Music Knowledge while implying that Randall is not really a music fan, since he would only be interested in music that appears in the games that he plays.\n\n
