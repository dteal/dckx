n\nIn the Book of Exodus in the Bible, God announces his presence to Moses by way of a burning bush. The quotation in this comic is a combination of Exodus 3:14- "I am that I am", and Exodus 3:16-- "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob."\nThe punchline comes when God introduces "His counterpart, R2-D2"; theoretically, in the mind of the reader, God\'s voice would go from booming and sepulchral to snooty and British, much like the voice of C-3PO in Star Wars. C-3PO\'s programming forbids him to "impersonate a deity", according to his character in Return of the Jedi.\nThe joke is that "I AM", the name of God in the Bible, is represented in the Hebrew by the Tetragrammaton, YHWH. This abbreviation coincidentally&#91;citation needed&#93; follows the 4-character naming convention of Star Wars droid characters such as C-3PO and R2-D2 and, like the latter, contains identical characters in the 2nd and 4th positions. (In English translations of the text, this is the part rendered as "LORD" in capitals.)\nThe reference to Bocce in the title text refers to a language that Owen Lars wanted his protocol droid purchase to be able to speak. C-3PO claimed that it was "like a second language to me." LO-M is a model of droid in the Star Wars universe that was made to compete commercially with 3PO droid like C-3PO (and sounds like "Elohim", a Hebrew word for "God".)\n\n
