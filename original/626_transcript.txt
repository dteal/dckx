n\nIsaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz both developed calculus independently of each other about eight years apart, as it says in the comic. However, although Newton had begun working on calculus before Leibniz, he didn\'t publish it, and Leibniz was the first to publish it (see the Leibniz\xe2\x80\x93Newton calculus controversy).\nIn calculus a derivative is the result of mathematical differentiation: the instantaneous rate of change of a function relative to its argument, and denoted df(x)/dx. Another way to think of the derivative is as a plot of all the slopes of lines tangent to the graph of a function. However, the literary word derivative means developed from something older or copied/adapted from others, as Newton claims is the case here.\nThe pun is that Newton is claiming that Leibniz\'s mathematical derivative is a derivative, or descendant, from his earlier development of this calculus.\nThe comic as a whole is mocking the pattern of corny one-liners that David Caruso often spurts out during the opening scenes of CSI: Miami. The one liner is followed by him dramatically pulling off or putting on his sunglasses and then the show breaks into the title sequence which starts with the word "YEEEEAAAAAAAH" (as noted in the title text). This has become a popular Internet meme and was used frequently with Michael Jackson\'s death. The sunglasses joke was also used in the title text of 977: Map Projections.\n\n
