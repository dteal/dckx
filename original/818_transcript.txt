n\nThis is the first comic about Randall\'s fianc\xc3\xa9e\'s (now wife) cancer.\nIt is self-explanatory, although vague on specifics.\nMore details and related comics are on the Category:Cancer page.\nIn the comic Randall mentions that he might not be able (or interested) in sticking to the normal schedule. But he did manage to do that anyway. However, this comic was posted on a Friday, and already the week after the next, xkcd was overtaken by guest during the Guest Week. Maybe this was his on-line comic colleagues who gave him a helping hand?\n\n
