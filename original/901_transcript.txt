n\nThis is a play on the fact that many digital thermometers look similar to pregnancy tests. Cueball, perhaps feeling ill, thinks he is using a thermometer to measure his body temperature and determine if he has a fever. As a male, he is presumably doubly surprised when the thermometer tells him instead that he is pregnant.\nThe two bars on the thermometer are similar to lines that appear on a traditional pregnancy tests. One bar is the control line; it will become visible given any normal urine sample. If it doesn\'t appear, the test is invalid. The other bar, the test line, reacts to human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone that\'s released during pregnancy. If both lines become visible, the test result is positive; if only the control line becomes visible, the test result is negative. Other results are invalid, since the control line didn\'t appear.\nThermometers are typically used to measure temperature, and the title text notes that this clever thermometer has also detected a fever in the baby.\n\n
