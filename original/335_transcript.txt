n\nA commonly cited problem with cuddling is that whatever arms you and your partner are lying on tend to fall asleep from your and/or your partner\'s weight, and are in any case not very comfortable to be lying upon. Here Cueball and Megan have invented a mattress with a slot in it to solve that problem. To provide an activity for their lower arms when they are comfortably placed in that slot, they have installed a game of "Rock \'em Sock \'em Robots" underneath the bed.\nThe humour arises from the juxtaposition of a sedate activity like cuddling with a boisterous activity like "Rock \'em Sock \'em Robots" with the implication that Megan and Cueball are doing both at once.\nThe title text refers to a series of commercials for Tempur-Pedic mattresses where the presenter would place a wine glass on the mattress and then jump up and down somewhere else on the mattress. The fact that the wine did not spill was meant to indicate that one partner\'s motions would not disturb the other. It is implied that he did that test on this mattress and fell into the slot, hurting himself.\n\n
