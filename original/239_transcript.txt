n\nFacts become distorted as time moves forward. What do we know about the Elizabethan times? They spoke strange English. What will 400 years from now think of the first twenty years of the Internet? Crazy people said crazy things online. Will we even say "online" 400 years from now? Won\'t the internet be everywhere, and everyone on it all the time in their retinal implants that being "offline" will seem absurd?\nParticular facts that this reinactor seems to have confused are:\n1) "battling roving bands of trolls".  Trolls in fantasy refer to monstrous creatures that are often antagonists who do battle with heroes.  However, online trolls refer to disruptive members of discussion boards.\n2) "The generation\'s finest minds meeting on comment threads, ... and holding the great dialogues of the age!"  As Randall has pointed out in other comics (202: YouTube, 301: Limerick, and 481: Listen to Yourself), the discussions that take place online are often very poor examples of intellectual discourse.\n"Ren Faire" is short for "Renaissance Faire", described as "an outdoor weekend gathering, usually held in the United States, open to the public and typically commercial in nature, which emulates a historic period for the amusement of its guests." \nWhile Cory Doctorow is not in this comic, the character is cosplaying him. This comic inspired several xkcd readers to give Cory Doctorow a red cape and goggles when he won the 2007 EFF Pioneer Award. Cory Doctrow\'s balloon is featured in 482.\nThe title Blagofaire might be an amalgamation between Blogosphere, Medieval Faire, and Blag; Randall\'s way of referencing his blog.\nThe title text is probably the future cosplayer referring to the state of the future internet, indicating some organizational structure that constrains and stratifies it, and his preference for what he perceives as the wild and unfettered internet of the past.\n\n
