n\nThis comic refers to the fact that many keyboards, especially desktop keyboards, gather large amounts of crumbs and are rarely cleaned. In the comic, a person (probably Black Hat) tricks an unassuming character into lifting his keyboard up so that all the crumbs fall down onto his face. By tricking the victim into de-focusing, the prankster ensures the victim will not notice the crumbs coming out of the keyboard until it is too late, perfecting a quality online prank.\nThe title text references the toy Etch A Sketch in which you would draw lines using two knobs and shake the Etch A Sketch to clear the screen. If you shook a gross keyboard, you would get filth on you as well.\nThe cleanliness (or lack thereof) of keyboards are mentioned in the title text of 1395: Power Cord.\n\n
