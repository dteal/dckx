n\nCueball starts reading a book off the shelf as he considers buying it, but gets so engrossed in it that he accidentally reads the entire thing, eliminating his reason for buying it in the first place. Quietly putting it back, he turns to leave the store, only to have the book (which exists in his brain as information) set off the store\'s anti-theft sensor. This is a satire of copyright as it pertains to digital copies, because when you download a game or music file (or read a book, in this case), you are merely making an identical copy of the source material.\nThe title text suggests that if the security guard wants to do a brain search, he might want to skip over all the, probably sexual, encounters Cueball has had with the security guard\'s mom, thus inducing a maternal insult (or commonly referred to as a "yo mama" joke.)\n\n
