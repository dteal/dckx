n\nThis comic is one of a series of My Hobby comics. Here Randall describes a "hobby" of confusing self-righteous hybrid car drivers by creating situational irony.\nThere are many anecdotal instances of drivers of "green" vehicles both criticizing owners of less fuel-efficient vehicles (such as SUVs) and for taunting them about how much more they are paying for fuel. Randall is reversing this by taunting/criticizing the owner of a Prius hybrid vehicle as though their roles were reversed. The owner of the hybrid car is irritated and does not understand what is being said.\nThe title text, rather than being a joke or additional punchline, seems to be a serious opinion about how much more efficient electric vehicles are compared to gas-powered vehicles; they would be a far superior form of transportation if only they weren\'t so expensive. But an electric skateboard can only move a fraction of mass comparing to an SUV.\n\n
