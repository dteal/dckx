n\nThe Blogosphere is a blanket term for all the blogs on the internet, that link together and share information to the extent that the term "blogosphere" arose to describe the collective of blogs. This comic proposes a new structure for defining all blogs by: a fractal of blogs.\nEdward Tufte is a statistician who worked on data visualization and wrote books on the subject, including "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information", as mentioned in the title text.\n\n\n\n Meme \n Explanation\n\n\nTripMaster Monkey says \n Tripmaster Monkey is a book by Maxine Hong Kingston about Wittman Ah Sing, an American graduate of Chinese heritage. \'Monkey says\' may be based on the saying \'Monkey See, Monkey Do\'.\n\n\n118th Post!! \n A riff on the "first post" phenomenon.\n\n\nWikiconstitution! \n The Onion wrote a 2005 article about putting the Constitution on a Wiki to allow public editing.\n\n\nOMG \n Common acronym for "Oh My God", often used in messaging.\n\n\nDeCSS \n DeCSS was a piece of code for decrypting DVDs.

Cory Doctorow is a strong activist in this area.\n\n\nHey guys what if Google is evil?!? \n Don\'t be evil is the corporate motto of Google, however the sheer quantity of data held by Google is a somewhat scary thought. A number of conspiracy theories exist that Google is evil, bent on world domination, run by the government/CIA/FBI/illuminati/aliens.\n\n\nI\'ll sleep with you for a FreeIpods deal. \n This is a parody on how desperate people are in getting either iPhones (extremely popular yet expensive smartphones from Apple) or getting laid.

Clearly this person is tired of those jokes.

In this post, the poster linked the September 11 incident to Trent Lott (a former US Senator).\n\n\nWeb 7.1 \n This is a parody of Web 2.0, a concept in which content from the Internet is provided beyond the webpage. Despite its name, Web 2.0 does not really involve making an entirely new series of tubes or updating the existing ones, a point that the post parodies.\n\n\nKryptonite\xe2\x84\xa2 locks vulnerable to "keys!" \n In about 2004, it was demonstrated that some tubular pin tumbler locks of the diameter used on Kryptonite locks could easily be opened with the shaft of an inexpensive Bic ballpoint pen of matching diameter, and this was widely reported.\n\n\nInteresting post!

(One example: an exploit in video-game consoles would permit someone to play homebrew applications or pirated games among other things.) In this case, the exploit went beyond the technological, permitting the exploiter to meet girls.\n\n\nInternets! \n "Internets" is a memetic version of saying "Internet".\n\n\nHoward Dean? \n Howard Dean was Chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009, among other important positions.\n\n\nSo I hear there\'s a hurricane. \n Blogging shut-ins can be hilariously out of touch with the outside world.

"Da" is a common intentional misspelling of "the".\n\n\nModeration: +1 Sassy \n A joke on Slashdot\'s moderating mechanism.  Each post can get a moderation that consists of a score (+1/-1) and a reason (Insightful/Funny/Troll/etc.)  "Sassy" is not one of the standard reasons.\n\n\nRSS! \n RSS again.\n\n\nA-list \n the most popular bloggers in the blogosphere are referred to as A-list, following a similar designation for actors.

The second half turns it around, because people often say "I did X, watch it on YouTube".\n\n\nHEY LOOK ROBOTS! \n Both real-world experiments with robotics and science fiction stories involving robots are popular on the internet.\n\n\nNet Neutrality! \n Net neutrality is a hot topic.  It is the principle that ISPs and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally. There is great debate as to what level this should be enforced or not, and whether it should be regulated.\n\n\nFriends Only. \n Personal blogging and social media websites typically have privacy settings that allow you to control who can see the posts. The "Friends Only" setting would prevent anyone that the user has not granted the "Friend" status to from seeing the content.\n\n\nDupe! \n A common note if the same thing gets posted twice on some forum (Short for "duplicate".). There are two instances of this in the comic, therefore one of them is a dupe itself.\n\n\nAJAX? \n AJAX is a generic brand found in Mickey Mouse Works cartoons. It is also a JavaScript-based web technology enabling complex user interfaces and a brand of cleaning powder.\n\n\nCOMPLY \n This is likely a reference to science fiction stories where a race of cyborgs or collection of robots try to assimilate, force compliance upon, or otherwise enslave all life in the universe.\n\n\nCowboy Neal \n one of the original Slashdot editors\n\n\nBlogodrome \n This is a parody on the word "blogosphere."\n\n\nHey look I got Linux running on my tonsils! \n People would often brag about getting linux to run on strange hardware, from toasters to esoteric computers.  This is taken to the ridiculous extreme of tonsils.\n\n\nLook alive, blogonauts! \n Possibly a comment from a moderator of a dying blog attempting to motivate their users into generating more content.\n\n\nCafepress cockrings \n Cafepress is a website which allows users to put pictures/logos on just about anything (T-shirts, mugs, etc.). Currently, however, cockrings are not available.\n\n\nBOOBIES!! \n Another reference to the "First Post" phenomenon.  The popular news site FARK automatically changes entries of "First post" to "BOOBIES" and modifies the timestamp to be many hours in the future.\n\n\nMIA \n "Missing in Action", a term applied to people who fought in wars yet were never found.\n\n\nA Beowulf Cluster... of BLOGS!! \n A Beowulf cluster is a computer cluster of computers networked together resulting in a high-performance parallel computing cluster.  For a while, it was a fad to get one running on various strange platforms.  This is a facetious example.\n\n\nSPOILER ALERT \n Often stated on the top of a post that contained spoilers. (See Spoiler (media).)\n\n\nYou have been eaten by a Grue. \n This is a reference to the first of the Zork games. When the protagonist enters a house, the protagonist would quickly enter a dark corridor. Attempting to travel without some form of light would lead to the message "You have been eaten by a Grue," ending the game. Said message became a meme.\n\n\nRuby on a monorail \n A riff on the name Ruby on Rails, a common platform for web applications.\n\n\nLesbians! \n Homosexual eroticism is rather popular on the internet, doubly so with the opposite gender (i.e. lesbians with straight men).\n\n\nDNF Released! \n "Duke Nukem Forever", a memetically long overdue sequel to the popular first person shooter video game "Duke Nukem", was still unreleased at the time this comic was published; the blog is either a hoax of some kind or yet another jab at the long development cycle.\n\n\nSteampunk \n Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that involves the blending of futuristic technology with Victorian Era aesthetics and materials.\n\n\nBLAG \n "Blag" is a memetic form of "blog".\n\n\nPONIES! \n A pony is a short horse. This could also refer to the Hasbro line of "My Little Pony" toys, popular with young girls.\n\n\nXeni found some porn! \n In some roleplaying games, whenever a character finds something, the message "[name] found [item]" appears. In this case, Xeni found pornography. Xeni probably refers to Xeni Jardin, a BoingBoing editor\n\n\nIRONY \n This could be a reference to criticisms that the Internet doesn\'t know what "irony" means.\n\n\nLIARS! \n This could be a reference to a recurring comment indicating that the original post is fabricated.\n\n\nLinux on Rails! \n Another riff on the name Ruby on Rails.\n\n\nBlogocube \n This is just a parody of the name "blogosphere".\n\n\ndel.icio.us! \n Del.icio.us (this post making a pun on the word "delicious!", obviously) is a bookmark-sharing service. After complaints that Yahoo ate and killed the service, it was sold traded around for a while; it still exists, but under new software and management.\n\n\n404 \n "Web page not found", probably the most common error gotten in a web browser: HTTP 404.\n\n\no.O \n An emoticon indicating confusion.\n\n\nDon\'t slam the source when you close it. \n The original phrase (generally spoken from parents to children) is "Don\'t slam the door when you close it." This twists it around to refer to Closed source software.\n\n
