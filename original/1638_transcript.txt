n\nMost programming languages use the concept of a string literal, which is just a text between some delimiters, usually quotes. For example, "Hello, world" is a string literal. The text being represented is Hello, world without the quotes. However, the quotes are also written to mark the beginning and end of the string. This is a problem when the text itself contains a quote, as in "This is a "quoted" string". The quotes around the word "quoted" are intended to be part of the text, but the language processor will likely confuse it for the end of the string, which would thus be two strings with quoted outside these strings (probably resulting in a syntax error).\nTo avoid this problem, an escape character (usually a backslash) is prepended to non-string-terminating quotes. So, the previous text would be written as "This is a \\"quoted\\" string". The language processor will substitute every occurrence of \\" with only the quote character, and the string terminates at the quote character which does not immediately follow a backslash. In this case the resulting text string would be This is a "quoted" string as intended.\nHowever, the problem now is that the intended text might contain a backslash itself. For example, the text "C:\\" will now be interpreted as an unterminated string containing a quote character. To avoid this, literal backslashes also are escaped with a second backslash, i.e. instead of "C:\\" we write "C:\\\\", where the language processor interprets \\\\ as one single backslash and the quote terminates the string to give C:\\ as the output.\nThis doubling of backslashes happens in most programming and scripting languages, but also in other syntactic constructs such as regular expressions. So, when several of these languages are used in conjunction, backslashes pile up exponentially (each layer has to double the number of slashes). See example of a backslash explosion and alternatives to avoid this below.\nThis kind of backslash explosion is known as Leaning toothpick syndrome, and can happen in many situations. Below is an explanation of all the entries in the comic.\nThe backslash explosion in the title text is about a bash command (which uses the backslash to escape arguments) invoking the grep utility which searches for text following a pattern specified by means of a regular expression (which also uses the backslash to escape special characters). This leads to 3 backslashes in a row in the command, which could easily become 7 backslashes in a row if the text being searched for also contains a backslash.\nEven advanced users who completely understand the concept often have a hard time figuring out exactly how many backslashes are required in a given situation. It is hopelessly frustrating to carefully calculate exactly the number of backslashes and then noticing that there\'s a mistake so the whole thing doesn\'t work. At a point, it becomes easier to just keep throwing backslashes in until things work than trying to reason what the correct number is.\nIt\'s unclear whether the regular expression in the title text is valid or not. A long discussion about the validity of the expression has occurred here on this explanation\'s talk page. The fact that many editors of the site, often themselves extremely technically qualified&#91;citation needed&#93;, can\'t determine whether the expression is valid or not, adds a meta layer to the joke of the comic. This is an example of nerd sniping (oh, the irony\\!\\!\\!\\).\n\n
