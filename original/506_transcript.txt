n\nThis comic is a satirical play on O Henry\'s short story The Gift of the Magi. In O Henry\'s story, a couple with very little money go to great lengths to purchase gifts for one another. The wife sells her prized possession, her hair, to purchase a fancy chain for her husband\'s prize possession, a watch; while the husband sells his watch to purchase some fancy hair accessories (clips/combs) for his wife. The story is about selflessness, as each party sold their prize possession to purchase something to enhance the other\'s prize possession.\nIn this comic however, the opposite occurs: Black Hat stole Danish\'s Roomba (an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner) and sold it to buy a new game for his Xbox, while Danish stole Black Hat\'s Xbox and sold it to buy a "dueling harness" for her Roomba, highlighting their mutually destructive selfishness. Although these actions reflect their sociopathic personalities and are at each other\'s detriment, both are apparently touched by the simultaneity of their selfish actions and the symmetry of the consequences. This is a play on the reaction that readers typically have upon reading the O Henry story: although neither of the characters can actually use their gift, the gifts are touching nevertheless because they are literal symbols of the self-sacrificing love the characters have for each other.\nThe "dueling harness", also mentioned in the title text, is an invention by Randall, which would apparently pit the Roombas against each other like the robots in Robot Wars.\n\n
