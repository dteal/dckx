n\nIt must be part of the human condition that causes us to think that odd statements are sometimes more humorous than those supposed to be funny. Cueball makes a true statement, that his statement is not very funny. However, because he invoked irony and thus makes it self-referential, the sentence is now funny! The other guy (also a Cueball like character), producing a fake laugh, is probably not so sure that it is actually funny.\nNow going meta: In 20,000 years, there might be no more humans on earth to find the irony funny any more. How ironic! Alternatively, the barren landscape would have occurred regardless of whether someone made the joke, so ironically the cautionary tale is completely meaningless, although still funny.  \nThis is the first xkcd comic showing stick figure people, which eventually becomes a defining characteristic of the future comic series. It is thus also the first comic with Cueball (and the first with Multiple Cueballs). \nThe "too much perspective" idea may reference the Total Perspective Vortex in The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy.  \nSelf-references was already used again in 33: Self-reference, and again and again, but never more famously than in 688: Self-Description.\n\n
