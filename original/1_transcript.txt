n\nThe comic shows a young boy floating in a barrel in a seemingly endless ocean. It comments on the unlikely optimism, and perhaps na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9, people sometimes display. The boy is completely lost, it would seem hopelessly alone, without any plan or control of the situation. Yet, rather than afraid or worried, he is instead quietly curious: "I wonder where I\'ll float next?"\nThe title text expands on the philosophical content, with the boy representing the average human being: wandering through life, with no real plan, quietly optimistic, always opportunistic, and clueless as to what the future may hold.\nThe isolation of the boy may also represent the way in which we often feel lost through life, never knowing quite where we are, believing that there is no one to whom to turn.\nThis is the first in a six-part series of comics whose parts were randomly published during the first several dozen strips. The series features a character that is not consistent with what would quickly become the xkcd stick figure style. The character is in a barrel.\nIn 1110: Click and Drag there is a reference to this comic at 1 North, 48 East.\nAfter Randall released the full The Boy and his Barrel story on xkcd it has been clear that the original Ferret story should also be included as part of the barrel series.\nThe full series can be found here. But below they are listed in the order Randall has put them in his collection linked to above:\n\n 1: Barrel - Part 1\n 20: Ferret\n 11: Barrel - Part 2\n 22: Barrel - Part 3\n 25: Barrel - Part 4\n 31: Barrel - Part 5\n\n
