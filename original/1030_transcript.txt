n\nThis comic is a take on one of the typical revenge tactics in dating and in life, which is one person "keying" the car of another. To "key" a car is to drag a key across the side of the car, sometimes multiple times, ruining the paint job. Instead, our friend Beret Guy painted a really detailed key on the side of Ponytail\'s car in his version of "keying" a car. She broke up with him the day before, as she explains to Cueball, but Beret Guy is so strange that she now can\'t tell if it was revenge or even if he remembers that she broke up with him.\nThe title text is a reference to the song "Before He Cheats" by Carrie Underwood; a revenge song in which Carrie Underwood imagines her boyfriend cheating and takes revenge on his prized car. This explains why Beret Guy might also paint a key on Carrie Underwood\'s car specifically, but it just confuses the situation since it brings into doubt the theory of him "keying" her car out of revenge (there is no known reason or reference to a reason for Beret Guy to want revenge on Carrie Underwood in the XKCD continuity).  The second part of the title text in which Beret Guy sent Ponytail a scone further confuses the situation, causing Ponytail to completely give up on dating.\nBeret guy and scones are also referenced in 452: Mission and in the title text of 677: Asshole. His love for bakeries was first mentioned in 434: xkcd Goes to the Airport.\n\n
