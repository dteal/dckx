n\nDaft Punk is a French electronic music group. The beat used in electronic music can be vocalized or spelled as "unn-tss". \'The Tell-Tale Heart\' is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, in which the narrator tries to appear sane while describing how he killed a man and hid his body in the floorboards. Eventually, he imagines he hears the dead man\'s heartbeat through the floorboards.\nCueball narrates that he killed Daft Punk and hid their bodies under the floorboards, as the narrator of \'The Tell-Tale Heart\' did. (Having to outsmart a band named Daft Punk is quite ironic.) He says he has been haunted by the sound of the band\'s beats.\nIn the title text, the narrator continues trying to assert his sanity. He then insinuates that he will kill Roderick Usher\'s band; however, Roderick Usher was only a character in \'Fall of the House of Usher\', another story by Edgar Allan Poe, making a pun on \'house\', a genre of electronic music.\n\n
