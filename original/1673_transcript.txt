n\nRandall created what is supposedly a 200 year history for bicycles with 13 designs ranging from 1810 to 2016. However, a cursory glance at each one shows that they are almost all fictitious, heavily flawed, and most don\'t even fit the definition of "bicycle". The main point of the comic is to show off these silly joke designs.\nThe only model that both looks like a real model and fits the year is the 1875 model, which resembles the Penny-farthing. The Penny-farthing was popular in the 1870s until the Safety bicycle took over around 1880. The 1875 model appears to be missing handlebars, but it\'s worth noting that on the real bicycle, the handlebars were very small and close to the saddle, and may be too small to appear in the drawing.\nThe 1860 model looks like the American Star Bicycle, but that bicycle was first invented in the 1880s.\nThe 1900 model looks like one of Paul Scheerbart \'s perpetual motion machines.\nSome of the other examples of "bikes" could, however, look like those in the image at the top of the Velocipede Wikipedia page.\nSeveral of the "bikes" are shown with a human \xe2\x80\x94 Ponytail is "riding" the pole-vaulting bike, Cueball appears in four designs, and Megan appears in three. These humans provide a sense of scale and, in some cases, a demonstration of how the bike might be operated. Cueball\'s appearance in the 1900 design shows how huge that bike is, appearing to dwarf the previous two models while continuing the short trend of ever-increasing size.\nOnly two of the bikes have pedals (1875 and 2016) and another two have a sprocket with a chain (1900 and 1980). Seven designs include a seat for the rider &#8212; eight if you count the device holding Megan in the 1980 model.\nThe 1925 model is reminiscent of a fractal; Benoit Mandelbrot was born in October 1924.\nThe 1880 model could be the result of an evolutionary algorithm trying to produce a bicycle. Some sub-optimal algorithms that have been given the task of creating a vehicle have been shown to misplace parts in ways that makes them completely useless and/or inaccessible &#8212; for example, placing a small wheel inside a much larger wheel.\nThis comic (especially the 2016 bicycle) is possibly also a reference to The Science of Cycology, a cognitive psychology project run by Rebecca Lawson at the University of Liverpool, which asked study participants to draw a bicycle from memory. The error rate was high, supporting a hypothesis that humans over-estimate their ability to explain how things work. Gianluca Gimini ran a similar project, Velocipedia, in which he asked people to draw free-hand sketches of bicycles from memory, then later rendered some of the results as if they were real bikes.\nAlso, the designs given for the years from 1825 to 1925 distinctly resemble designs that tend to evolve in the various challenge environments in the genetic evolution games BoxCar2D (Flash Player) or Genetic Cars 2 (HTML5).\nThe 1980 design looks strikingly similar to the southpark "wild whacky action bike".\nThe title text refers to the scene labeled "1955" which depicts Cueball being chased by 3 bicycle wheels. Whatever caused the wheels to chase Cueball down a hill is left to the reader\'s imagination. It could be that the wheels have become sentient and are actively chasing Cueball, or it could be that the bicycle failed horribly and Cueball is running from the wreckage. The era this "bike design" is from (1955, which is in the 50s) would be hard to ride a bike in if it was the only available design.\n\n
