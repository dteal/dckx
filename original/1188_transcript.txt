n\nThis is source code written in the Java programming language, which models a parent and a child playing a game of catch, in which the parent throws a ball to their child, who catches it and throws it back, which repeats. The comic title "Bonding" refers to the building of relationship between the parent and the child. But the computer program representation of this game is funny, using a play on the keywords throw and catch (and Throwable), which, in Java, do not correspond to throwing and catching a ball, but to a so-called exception handling, a method of signaling error conditions and responding to them.\nThe program, as written, will recursively call the aim method alternately on the parent and the child indefinitely, until the program crashes with a stack overflow.\nAlso, the terms "parent" and "child" are usually interpreted more abstractly in programming, as a generic terms used in hierarchical data structures.\nThe title text refers to Eclipse, which is a tool commonly used to develop software in Java. "Building character" is something that you would expect a parent to do, in order to instill in his child positive traits, such as athleticism. This is possibly a reference to Calvin and Hobbes, where Calvin\'s dad often encourages him to build character in a number of ways, including playing baseball. This is made more likely by other references combining technology and C+H, such as xkcd comics 409, 702, and 1002. However, here, "build" might also be a play on the term of "building" a program, while "character" refers to a data type. It may also refer to the common notion that programming in C++ or Java builds character due to their powerful but sometimes finicky libraries.\n\n
