n\nAIM (short for AOL Instant Messenger) offered its users profile pages to share info about themselves or their friends. Randall notes that these pages fall into one of three categories:\n\nPeople without friends or significant others linked to their LiveJournal;\nPeople with friends and significant others would celebrate it all over their page;\nSometimes people with friends would fill their profile with inside jokes only their friends could understand.\n\nBoth AIM and LiveJournal were known for their teenage user base, as shown by the title text\'s fictional AIM screen name.\nA complete list of flowchart comics can be found here.\n\n
