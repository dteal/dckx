n\nThis is another example of Randall\'s propensity towards "your mom" jokes. The second panel contains an eloquent prosaic description of an idyllic sunrise over an unfamiliar landscape analogizing the uncertainty and excitement of the life that lies ahead. This is designed to put the reader off-guard for the "your mom" stinger in the third panel.\nCueball wants to settle down on his own, but every time when he tries, he still ends up at the reader\'s Mom\'s place (as is customary in such jokes). \nIn photography the term Golden Hour is used to describe to the hour after sunrise (and also the hour before sunset), due to the good lighting conditions at those times. In the title text you could initially believe that Cueball is using these early morning trips to capture beatutiful photographs of the scenery, until it turns out that in fact the photos were of the reader\'s Mom (and likely risque in nature).\n\n
