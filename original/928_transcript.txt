n\nThis comic is a parody of fish and sea-life identification charts, referencing the mimic octopus which, as the name implies, is able to mimic other animals, so all animals and objects found in the sea could actually just be such an animal. \nThe identification chart for South East Asian sea life shows 13 creatures mimicked including eight individual fish (two of which are not yet recognized) and other objects and animals. Those that can be distinguished are: A Moorish idol (Gill, from Finding Nemo) A tuna (3rd), a clownfish (4th), a lionfish (6th, and from here the rest can be named), a shark, a sea lilies, an angler fish, an anchor, a submarine, a scuba diver and school of 11 fish. Finally there is an octopus, but where all the other silhouettes are labeled Mimic octopus the single octopus is labeled Two Mimic Octopuses, which is the pun of this comic. \nThe Orson Scott Card novel that the title text refers to is Lost Boys: "A withdrawn eight-year-old in a troubled family invents imaginary friends who bear the names of missing children" (Publisher\'s Weekly). The part of the story that Randall is referring to (Chapter 7, Crickets) involves a situation where the protagonist, Stewie, is given a C grade for an otherwise impeccable diorama featuring underwater animals involving clay sculptures (when only a poster would have sufficed) and a well-written presentation supposedly because the other children had destroyed the diorama before the end of the day. To make matters worse, his teacher, Ms. Jones, had made fun of his project and given the ribbon for first prize to someone else. \nOn inquiring about, his father, Step, found out that the principal, Dr. Mariner, had already made the decision to hand Stewie the blue ribbon for first prize as she had reviewed the project before it had been destroyed, but Ms. Jones had secretly overruled her behind her back by announcing that another child (JJ) would receive the ribbon. So, the next day he met up with Ms Jones after school to have a word on the grading of his project. Needless to say, they ended up arguing about minor issues, with Mrs Jones justifying the reason for her decision on, among other things, the definition of a \'depiction\', whether or not the amount of content was defined by the word count or the number of pages and of the importance of putting the report in a plastic cover. The argument finally comes to a head when Step points out that there was only one red mark on the project report, and that concerned an \'incorrect\' pluralization of the word \'octopus\' \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mrs. Jones, surely you know that the plural of \xe2\x80\x9coctopus\xe2\x80\x9d is either \xe2\x80\x98octopus\xe2\x80\x99, with nothing added, or \xe2\x80\x98octopuses\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jones.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink again, Mrs. Jones.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe must have realized that she was not on firm ground here. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps \xe2\x80\x98octopuses\xe2\x80\x99 is an alternate plural, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that \xe2\x80\x98octopi\xe2\x80\x99 is the preferred.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mrs. Jones. If you had looked it up, you would have discovered that \xe2\x80\x98octopi\xe2\x80\x99 is not the preferred spelling. It is not a spelling at all. The word does not exist, except in the mouths of those who are pretending to be educated but in fact are not. This is because the \xe2\x80\x98us\xe2\x80\x99 ending of \xe2\x80\x98octopus\xe2\x80\x99 is not a Latin nominative singular ending, which would form its plural by changing to the letter \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99. Instead, the syllable \xe2\x80\x98pus\xe2\x80\x99 in \xe2\x80\x98octopus\xe2\x80\x99 is the Greek word for \xe2\x80\x98foot.\xe2\x80\x99 And it forms its plural the Greek way. Therefore \xe2\x80\x98octopoda\xe2\x80\x99, not \xe2\x80\x98octopi\xe2\x80\x99. Never \xe2\x80\x98octopi\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, octopoda. Your son\xe2\x80\x99s paper said octopuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Step. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he asked me the correct plural, I told him octopoda. But then he was still uncertain, because my son doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think he knows something until he knows it, and so he looked it up. And to my surprise, octopoda is only used when referring to more than one species of octopus, rather than when referring to more than one actual octopus. What Stevie put in his paper is in fact the preferred dictionary usage. Which you would have known, too, if you had looked it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter proving his case that his son did indeed deserve an A grade, he then threatened to bring the matter to the attention of the principal. He then warned Mrs Jones that while he wanted the grade to remain unchanged, he wanted her to inform the class that the ribbon would be awarded to Stewie, before revealing that he had been recording the conversation all along. And, after this, after Mrs Jones came crying for forgiveness before leaving, Step realized how vulnerable she was and how she was channeling her frustration at one particular student in each class to find some relief from that.\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, \'octopi\', \'octopuses\', and \'octopodes\' (UK English) are all correct plural versions of "octopus." Supposedly, Randall would very much like the word \'octopi\' to remain unrecognized by major dictionaries as otherwise it would lessen the magnitude of the climactic conclusion of this argument by rendering Step\'s mockery of Ms. Jones\' perceived intellectual superiority factually invalid. This also offers another reason, apart from the pun, why the octopus in the chart is named two mimic octopuses, so Randall can use the correct pluralization of the word in the comic. This is an example of a comic where the title text seems more important to Randall than the actual comic.\nIt should be noted that, at least according to Etymology Dictonary, Octopi is wrong for exactly the reasons that Step lists and first appears over 60 years later.\n\n
