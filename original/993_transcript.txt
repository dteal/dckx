n\nThis comic presents Randall\'s idea for a line of food products all with clear black font on a white background. The products with black block lettering and white background stand out from the other items in this comic. The irony is that even though the branding isn\'t terribly creative, the lack of complexity is what causes the products to stand out. These product packaging styles resemble no-frills products and generic brands.\nThe style of packaging might be a reference to The Prisoner TV series from the \'60s, a dystopia set in a village (actually, "the village") locked out from the outside world. The shops here only sell "village food". See this photo for an example.\nIt might also be a reference to Portal\xe2\x80\x99s bean cans.\nIn the title text, the lack of a listed URL relates to the lack of branding on the package. It is possible that omitting the URL the consumer\'s curiosity will be aroused, and they will spend time on the internet hunting for the actual site.\n\n
