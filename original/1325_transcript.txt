n\nIn popular culture women are sometimes said to not be interested in nice guys, as in common interpretations of the phrase nice guys finish last which originally belongs to baseball. \nThe Cueball-like guy on the left in this picture is presumably frustrated and complaining because he has been rejected by a woman, and thinks it\'s because he\'s the "nice guy" type. Cueball\'s sarcastic interjection implies that saying that women don\'t want nice guys and presuming to know what women "really want" is actually showing a rejection of that woman\'s agency, which might be the real reason she rejected him. It fits with one of the negative connotations of "nice guy": one who does not express his true feelings and/or is passive-aggressive.\nThe title text continues the "conversation", with Cueball implying that he believes that the first guy is bad at taking hints. He offers a "crash course" in hint taking by clarifying outright that he is trying to end the conversation while the first guy continues to follow him.\nThough this guy might indeed be a jerk, there are also many other reasons why a woman might reject a guy who isn\'t a jerk.\nThe concept of the self-identifying "nice guy" who actually may have less than admirable motives is also explored in 513: Friends. See also the concept of "negging" as used in 1027: Pickup Artist: you belittle chicks to undermine their self-confidence so they\'ll be more vulnerable and seek your approval.\n\n
