n\nIt\'s hard to know when you are in a relationship in modern times. In olden days you might fancy a girl, and then ask her father if you might court her, and if he granted his permission you would be a couple. Today, that kind of structure and formality is terrifyingly antiquated; as a result we don\'t have any of the straightforward cues.\nThis comic suggests that "making it Facebook official", which means asserting the existence of a romantic relationship on Facebook by setting one\'s status to "In a relationship", has recently become a way to define when you are a couple. Cueball would like to do it, probably after having sex for the first time with his love interest, to get confidence in his relationship and/or show it off to his friends. Because his love interest isn\'t so sure about that relationship, or doesn\'t like to formalize it and prefers to enjoy without thinking too much about it, he suggests a compromise: using the "It\'s complicated" status instead. And he does so with a phrasing very reminiscent of a formal way to propose to marry someone ("Will you be my wife?").\nThe title text takes it a step further, suggesting that Facebook has become the only reliable way to know about relationships \xe2\x80\x94 even so, without access to Facebook, relationships can\'t evolve.\n\n
