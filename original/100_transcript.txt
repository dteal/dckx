n\nFamily Circus is a comic characterized by single-pane round comics with a caption below the comic. Jeff is a character in Family Circus, and dotted lines representing his wanderings are a frequent theme of Family Circus comics. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental illness that compels the sufferer to perform repetitive actions. Common symptoms include, but are not restricted to, excessive hand washing and repeated opening and closing of a door.\nThe comic depicts the character Jeffy as having Obsessive-compulsive disorder, and traces his movements over a period of time. The dotted line that depicts his movements returns frequently to the kitchen sink, presumably to repeatedly wash his hands.\nIn the title text Randall attributes this idea to the unknown friend David. He did the same in 42: Geico and 51: Malaria.\n\n
