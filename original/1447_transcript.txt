n\nIn the scientific literature, meta-analyses are studies which compare multiple studies on a single topic, with the aim of giving a balanced overview of the known results. Medline, Embase and Cochrane are medical research databases which give access to studies on drug effects or results of other medical procedures.\nThis comic explores the idea of iterating the process, going from meta-analyses to meta-meta-analyses (which actually exist, though not necessarily by that name, see below) and hence to a meta-meta-meta-analysis.\nOf course, the title text adds another level of meta-analysis, since he wants to make a meta-analysis of rejection letters which concern his meta-meta-meta analyses.\nAll of the cited meta-meta-analyses are real: M. Sampson (2003)[1], P. L. Royle (2005)[2], E. Lee (2011)[3] and A.R. Lemeshow (2005)[4].\nThe phrase "Too meta" can be found in the comments of videos, blog posts, and other internet content which are so abstract that they can\'t be easily interpreted.\nComic 93: Jeremy Irons similarly states a slightly absurd "life goal". 917: Hofstadter is "meta"-related.\n\n
