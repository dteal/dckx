n\nThe late Harold Camping, a Christian pastor, wrongly predicted that the world would end in May 21, 2011. After that prediction failed, he moved the date to October 21 of that year, and when that passed uneventfully, he recanted his belief that the end time could be calculated. In the Christian mythos, the end of the world is called "the second coming" (referencing the return of Jesus) or "the Rapture."\nThe first frame is a reference to raptors in Jurassic Park, and certainly not Randall\'s first raptor joke. In this film, the raptor dinosaurs get much more dangerous once they learn how to open doors. Cueball mishears Megan, which is why he thinks she said "raptor" instead of "Rapture".\nIn the second frame, Cueball references the Abrahamic Religions. Christian and church for Christianity, Mosque for Islam and Rabbi for Judaism.\nThe third frame is a math joke in which Megan references error bars which are used on graphs to indicate the uncertainty. So, Megan believes in one God (monotheism), as she says in the comic. But if she is still trying to find the error bars, and from the title text it is "one, plus or minus one", that could be in the range of zero (Atheism) to two (Bitheism).\nThe title text is a supposed excerpt from the holy text of experimental monotheism. First Corinthians is a book of the Christian Bible. Megan refers to chapter 8 verse 6 (\xc2\xb12), which would be verses 4\xe2\x80\x938. In the actual bible text, this section refers to idols and "so called gods", but also states "There is no God but one."\n\n
