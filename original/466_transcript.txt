Thus explaining the title of the comic: Moving.\nA cantenna is an self-made antenna made from a can, in this case a pringles can. Cueball is pointing his cantenna to the neighbors across the road, which, as he says, will allow him to connect to the wifi network there.\nMegan points out that the neighbors themselves don\'t have internet access, to which Cueball answers that he thinks that the neighbors will get hooked up to the internet first.\nThe title text continues this theme of connecting to other people\'s networks, noting that we should have a holiday in honour of those people who don\'t bother reconfiguring their Linksys routers (thus leaving them with the default name of \'linksys\'), which allows other people to connect to those networks very easily, as they aren\'t encrypted by default and don\'t need a password.\n\n
