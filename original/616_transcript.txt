n\nCueball is about to sign a lease to rent a building, but he\'s scared that he\'s not grown-up enough for the responsibility, presenting as evidence that he still plays with Lego building blocks.\nIn reality, as children, we often think that when we\'re adults, we\'ll somehow definitively feel like adults, but this isn\'t the case. We may become more responsible and capable over time, but we\'ll never attain the infallibility we erroneously associated with adults when we were children.\nOf course, Cueball actually isn\'t responsible and capable, since he drifts off to think about the fictional character Batman (who appears in comic books, often considered children\'s material), in the middle of a serious financial transaction.\nThe title text references one of xkcd\'s most famous comics, 150: Grownups, where Megan decides to use the freedom of adulthood to fill her apartment with playpen balls.\nIt is possible that this is a prequel to the events of 150: Grownups. After the events in this strip occur Cueball (as defined in explain xkcd) may have moved into the building where Megan lives, gets to know her and one day when he goes to see her, the events of 150: Grownups take place. From the title text we see the lessor can tell that Cueball would like Megan and from the events of Grownups we see that a romantic relationship of some sort did form.\n\n
