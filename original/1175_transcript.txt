n\nCueball and Megan are getting ready to ride an array of mini-conveyor belts, each going at a speed multiple of the first one\'s. Assuming they both take the one in front of them, each conveyor belt will speed them up a little bit more with little effort on their part, ultimately reaching a point where they are going very fast and are close enough to be able to high-five each other.\nThe average moving walkway speed globally is 3 feet/second (~1m/sec), so Cueball and Megan would only be travelling about 2/3 average human running speed by the time they meet.  Even with the opposing forces added to their high five, it would be very unlikely for them to injure each other (though the slap would more than likely be painful).\nThe title text may be a reference to a music video made by OK Go, "Here It Goes Again", in which the band jumps on and off of various treadmills in a similar fashion.\nA series of parallel accelerating conveyor belts is also a long distance travel mechanism used in Robert A. Heinlein\'s The Roads Must Roll and in Isaac Asimov\'s Robot Detective novels.\n\n
