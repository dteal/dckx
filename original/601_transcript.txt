n\nThe comic and title text is a direct reference to the movie WarGames. In the movie, a rogue AI is asked to play Global Thermonuclear War, a game simulating a nuclear attack scenario. After analyzing all possible strategies, the AI reports: "A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?". Interpreted literally, this means that the computer has figured out that it will lose the game no matter how it plays, so it chooses to play chess instead. A more profound interpretation is that wars always end badly for all parties involved so it\'s better to play nicer games like chess.\nThis comic asks an AI to "play love", which initially could be expected to end happily for everyone involved, as love is the opposite of war and war ends always so badly. Surprisingly, the result from the AI is the same: if you play love, you\'ll end up badly, regardless which moves you play. The title text leaves love as looking actually worse than war, since in war there\'s at least the "winning move" of not playing, however in love even refusing to play means that the player loses the game.\n\n
