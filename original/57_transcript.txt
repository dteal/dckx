n\nThis comic juxtaposes a familiar exchange with a surreal outcome.\nMegan is returning after a short absence. Cueball reacts as if she had been gone for years, and admits to having an affair while waiting. \nIn this comic, a familiar exchange occurs where one person asks the other why they did not wait.  The humor lies in the improbability for him to fall in love and have an affair within 90 seconds, the impossibility for him to have a son in that time, and the ridiculous notion that the son would now be about Megan\'s (and thus also Cueball\'s) current age. This is of course impossible as it would imply that Cueball experienced twenty-ish years of life in what felt like 1.5 minutes for Megan. (He might conceivably have managed to have sex in that time span, which would fit with the experience of Cueball in 1068: Swiftkey).\nScott appears to be a friend of Randall. Comics 57 through 59 all have the title text Opening dialogue by Scott, forming a sort of informal mini-series inspired by him. They are:\n\n57: Wait For Me\n58: Why Do You Love Me?\n59: Graduation\n\nAs there already was a comic released on Monday that week, the first of these three were released already on Tuesday, then Wednesday and Friday. This may be related to the fact that this was the first week were the comics were not also released on LiveJournal.\n\n
