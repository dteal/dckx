n\nTwo Cueball-like guys ponder the unanswerable philosophical question of whether all people observe the universe the same, or whether, for example, what one person sees as "red" might be what another see as "green". They muse that no one really knows how anyone else sees the world.\nThe misdirection and punchline of the comic comes when the pole-guy asks if his friend can help him down from this pole where he\'s been standing the entire comic. The friend\'s reply indicates that he does not see a pole, proving that one person does observe the world differently than another; in this case, in a far more extreme and unexpected way than color differences.\nAnother interpretation of the punchline is that the friend doesn\'t like pole-guy\'s idea of questioning all of human existence, and mocks that philosophy by pretending not to see that he is standing on a pole.\nIn any case it is not possible to indicate which of these two Cueballs that are the protagonist so neither can be designated as "The Cueball" for this comic.\nThe concept on a philosopher on a pole is likely a reference to many "performing monks" of the late antiquity period, most famously Simeon Stylites. Such practitioners were common throughout the Roman Empire, and their goal was to show their devotion as proudly as possible.\nUnlike most other xkcd comics, the "panels" of this comic are not divided and are drawn within a single frame.\nAs noted at the title text, this comic is based on a comic drawn by Randall\'s brother Doug, although Randall apparently redrew and rewrote it.\n\n
