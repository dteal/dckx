n\nThis comic uses a Venn diagram to point out that there is often a significant disparity between what a university displays on the front page of its website and what users \xe2\x80\x94 particularly prospective students \xe2\x80\x94 are primarily interested in finding there.\nThis is often because those who are making the university website instinctively believe, from their perspective, that the website should contain things that the university is proud of, or that they personally find useful, so they are unable to look at it from the perspective of a person who is new on campus and simply wants to know what number to call for campus security. Thus, simple details like contact information and university data are often overlooked.\nThe title text presents a satirical response from the school defending their site design, consisting mostly of PR worthy of an alumni magazine (a publication that is seldom anticipated so eagerly). It also uses sarcasm to make fun of university websites that have wildly out of date site design (web technology was relatively primitive in 2001) and a CS (Computer Science) student built it instead of a professional.\n\n
