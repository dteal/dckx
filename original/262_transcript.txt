n\nThe LOLcat meme genre involves pictures of cats in various poses and facial contortions accompanied by deliberately misspelled captions. Black Hat claims to be from the Internet and is thus creating LOLcat memes by literally gluing captions to Cueball\'s cats.\nThe title text suggests that Black Hat is using glue only because he ran out of staples; fortunately for the cats in the picture, glue is much less painful than a staple. The title is also a reference to the "I\'m in ur base killing ur d00dz" catchphrase from real-time-strategy games.\n\n
