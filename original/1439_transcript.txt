n\nBlack Hat announces to Megan that 19-inch racks for datacenter servers and Langstroth hive frames are both 19 inches wide (482.6&#160;mm), with similar spacing between each slot. Black Hat is motivated by this knowledge to break into a Google datacenter and fill server racks with beehives. When Megan sarcastically consoles Black Hat for the loss of his hives, he declares that he\'ll find other datacenters to install hives in.\nThe pitch (or distance between repeating items) of 19&#160;inch rack server hardware is measured in rack units (U), and is standardized at 1.75" (44.45&#160;mm). Langstroth frames are typically mounted at a pitch of 1.5" (38.1&#160;mm), and as a result would fit relatively well with a server cabinet. In contrast to the horizontal orientation of the modules in a server rack, honeycomb frames are designed to hang vertically, so the cells can hold nectar without it dripping out. How Black Hat was able to re-orient the racks to suit the needs of honey production remains a mystery.\nSome datacenters provide colocation services where customers may install a server at a central location with better bandwidth and power reliability than a customer could provide on their own. Noticing that typical colocation terms of service (TOS) agreements don\'t specifically rule out the installation of beehives, Black Hat suggests he can enter a legal contract allowing him to install beehives at a data center without being kicked out.\nAs with many types of terms of service contracts, such as privacy agreements, a standard boilerplate wording is used amongst many contractors. Megan comments that a term forbidding the installation of beehives will quickly become a standard term in colocation agreements. The comic thus might be making fun of boilerplate legal agreements, which are commonly signed without being read, suggesting that the legal wording is so long and detailed that anything not specifically prohibited must be allowed.\nThe alt-text is a reference to the film Air Bud.
