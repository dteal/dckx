n\nThis comic shows a graph in which several "mysteries" are mentioned and placed on the graph according to how weird they are on the x-axis and the y-axis indicates whether Randall has an explanation or not for the mystery. Each item is listed in the table below.\nItems near the top-right corner (such as the MH 370 disappearance) are both mysterious and strange. Items near the bottom-left corner (such as Randall\'s absent-mindedness regarding ice cream) have a clear explanation and are not really strange either. Items near the top-left corner (such as the meaning of You\'re So Vain) are mysterious but not really strange. Items near the bottom-right corner (such as the Dyatlov Pass incident) have a clear explanation but are quite strange. \nThe title text refers to the mystery of Randall staying up late to read Wikipedia articles, when he was already supposed to be asleep an hour ago. This is apparently not very unusual for him (see for instance 214: The Problem with Wikipedia). And this mystery actually has an obvious explanation: Following up on an idea that eventually led to today\'s cartoon.\nSome of these mysteries have already been explored in xkcd. See 950: Mystery Solved where Randall "solves" Amelia Earhart, Lost Roanoke Colony, Jimmy Hoffa; 593: Voynich Manuscript; and 1400: D.B. Cooper.\nNote that Randall uses similar diagrams in both 388: Fuck Grapefruit and 1242: Scary Names which also different items.\n\n
