n\nThis is a parody of the popular song by The Righteous Brothers, "You\'ve Lost That Lovin\' Feelin\'". The singer is talking about the cooling of his relationship with his significant other, and how the joy of their romance has been missing lately, and asks what they have to do to get it back. The actual first verse and chorus are as follows:\n\nYou never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips\nAnd there\'s no tenderness like before in your fingertips\nYou\'re trying hard not to show it (baby)\nBut baby, baby, I know it:\n\nYou\'ve lost that lovin\' feelin\'\nOhh, that lovin\' feelin\'\nYou\'ve lost that lovin\' feelin\',\nNow it\'s gone, gone, gone, ohh-ohh.\n\nIn this comic\'s parody of the song, Cueball decides that since his relationship with his current girlfriend is cooling, maybe he should try her sister instead. (And as mentioned in the title text, at least she will have sex with him).\n\n
