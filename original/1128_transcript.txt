n\nFifty Shades of Grey is a best-selling novel featuring large quantities of BDSM sex. Wishbone was a children\'s TV show about a dog who draws parallels between literature and real life in his dreams, reenacting many literary classics. The show was especially praised in its time for refusing to censor the more unpleasant aspects of its source work. Many people within Randall\'s age group have experienced more literary classics through Wishbone than by actually reading them; this phenomenon lead to the creation of a Facebook group dedicated to that idea.\nIn the comic, Cueball claims to have learned all that he knows about Fifty Shades of Grey from the Wishbone adaptation of the book. Knowing the faithful nature of Wishbone\'s adaptations, an episode on the book would likely involve age-inappropriate material for children, as the sounds emanating from the TV would suggest.\nIn the title text:\n\nGreat Illustrated Classics is a series of easy to read adaptations of literary classics, including works by Charles Dickens and Stevenson\'s Treasure Island.\nThe Anarchist Cookbook, first published in 1971, is a book that contains instructions for the manufacture of explosives, rudimentary telecommunications phreaking devices, and other items. It was written by William Powell to protest United States involvement in the Vietnam War.\nOur Bodies, Ourselves is a book about women\'s health and sexuality produced by the nonprofit organization Our Bodies Ourselves (originally called the Boston Women\'s Health Book Collective). First published in 1971, it contains information related to many aspects of women\'s health and sexuality, including menopause, birth control, childbirth, sexual health, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental health and general well-being.\n\nPart of the title text joke is that the latter two works would not likely be the subject of Great Illustrated Classics or Wishbone. However, the title text may be actually technically 100% correct, if Randall hasn\'t ever had an in-depth conversation about either of the latter two works.\n\n
