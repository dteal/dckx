n\nCueball and Megan are in a long-distance relationship; in order to overcome the distance which separates them, they\'re keeping in touch with an instant messenger. Because their contact is limited to text, they have to write out the actions they wish to enact. Cueball is frustrated with the limitations of these place-holding phrases and longs for physical contact, going so far as to imagine himself hugging Megan in the messenger window.\nIn the title text, Cueball suggests that, sometimes, the only way to end his frustration is to travel across the country and see her face-to-face.\n\n
