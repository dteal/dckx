n\nThe line "it has come to this" is usually seen on the verge of the climactic confrontation between the villain and his arch rival, or when one character has to unleash their utmost ability etc. Despite its dramatic tone, however, the statement is a content-free tautology, true in all possible scenarios in which time progresses in a forward direction. Accordingly, Cueball is saying it when Megan tells him that they have run out of cat food, a relatively trivial problem, that could be solved with a quick trip to the grocery store.\nThe title text is a follow-up on the comic dialogue. When Megan replies in confusion, "Come to what?" Cueball then uses another instantly-dramatic phrase that keeps his words ambiguous, only leaving her in the dark. The phrase, "You. Me. This moment." is used when brevity is key, and no information should be leaked to anybody listening. Those conversing then continue the important discussion elsewhere, allowing them to speak more openly.\nThe phrase "So it has come to this" is also said in: 225: Open Source.\n\n
