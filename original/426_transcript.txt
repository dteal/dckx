n\nGeocaching is a sport where you have to find things hidden by other people based on geographical coordinates. Randall has had a similar idea before in 201: Christmas GPS.\nGeohashing is a sport created by Randall based on reaching a random location determined by an algorithm that uses a hash function that involves the current date, location and the Dow opening price. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock market index dealt in New York City.\nThe algorithm is built in a way that:\n\nMakes it impossible to plan a meeting in advance - because of the Dow.\nChanges every day.\nGathers people that are nearby - everyone within the same 1\xc2\xb0\xc3\x971\xc2\xb0 grid square gets the same position.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n\n Take the current date in the format yyyy-mm-dd- and append the most recent opening value for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n Pass this string through the MD5 algorithm. \n Divide the hash value into two 16 character halves, and convert each half to a decimal.\n Take the integer portions of your current coordinates and append the decimal hash values.\n\nMD5 is a cryptographic hashing algorithm, and converts plaintext data into a seemingly random 128-bit (32 character) string. A good hashing algorithm should have three main properties: it is non-reversible and you cannot generate any plaintext data back from the hash, a given sample of data will always produce the same hash value, but even a tiny change to the original plaintext should produce an entirely different hash.\nThe example co-ordinates are for the Google headquarters in California, as you can see here: 37.421542 -122.085589.\nWhile geohashing was originally intended as a joke, there are people who geohash regularly.
