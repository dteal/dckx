n\nIn English, letters like X and Z are rarely used in the common vernacular. Marketers have found that names with these infrequently-appearing letters sell more products.\n\nScores\n\nThere are two explanations for scores. Both of them share the fact that Randall must have used a car-name database to calculate letter frequency in car models.\nThere are 19 positive scores and 17 negative scores, which is interpreted differently in each explanation.\n\nScore(x) = Frequency_in_cars(x) - Frequency_in_English(x)\n\nThis formula generates a positive number if a letter is more common in car models than in typical English (as X) which Randall then calls carlike. The formula generates a negative number if a letter\'s relative frequency in car models is lower than in typical English (as O) and Randall calls it English-like (more suitable for readable text). The letters F and B, with scores of 5 and -5, respectively, are about as common in English as in car models. With this nomenclature, the most English-like letter is Y because, while not the most common English letter, it is apparently extremely rare in car models. The most common letter in ordinary English is E, which is (presumably) fairly common in car models.\n\nScore(x) = Frequency_in_cars(x)\n\nIt seems that Randall arbitrarily used positive and negative numbers: if a letter is very common in car models (as X) he calls it carlike. If a letter is very uncommon in car models (as O) he calls it English-like. With this nomenclature the most English-like letter is Y, but actually Y is the least carlike letter. The most common letter in ordinary English is E. Y on the other hand is just in the middle (place 13), which can\'t be called English-like.\n\nAlgorithm for the index\n\nRandall devised an index for car models which is the score average divided by 10.\n\nExample\n\nWe take 2Chainz and add the scores of its different numbers and letters: 6 +27 -44 -14 -21 -46 +83 = -9\nAverage is -9/7 = -1.29 and divided by 10 it\'s -0.129 or -0.13.\n\nNames to avoid\n\nHonda 2Chainz - 2 Chainz is an American rapper\nMitsubishi Fhqwhgads - A reference to a running joke on Homestar Runner. See http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Fhqwhgads\nKia 49andGothy - Gothy or gothic is a member of the goth subculture; most of its members are much younger than 49\nChevrolet Niceguy - A reference to the idiom "nice guys finish last".\nOldsmobile Goodwood - May be a reference to the Goodwood Festival of Speed\nInfiniti Toothy69 - "69" is slang for a sex position where two participants pleasure each other orally; for obvious reasons, many would not want teeth involved.\nBMW Outhouse - Loose standing toilet, or Outhouse.\nVolkswagen Woodpony 7oh7 - Wood ponies are wooden constructions to give kids (and sometimes adults) the feeling of riding a horse, but don\'t actually move. 7oh7 is a way to pronounce 707, which could be a reference to the Boeing 707 passenger jet series.\nChrysler Uh Iono - When pronounced, sounds roughly like someone slurring "Uh, I don\'t know" [1]\nNissan Doody - An incredibly juvenile term meaning feces. May reference the unfortunately named Nissan Moco, which is Spanish for snot\n\nPotential Hits\n\nHonda 3Chainz - A play on 2Chainz in the previous section; according to the table the number 2 has a score of 6 and the number 3 has a higher score of 55; the index will go up by (55-6)/7/10=0.7.\nSubaru Andre3000 - Andr\xc3\xa9 3000 is an American rapper\nSuzuki Sexism - Akihiro Suzuki is a Tokyo city assemblyman who made sexist remarks in June 2014.\nLincoln Marxism - Marxism is a political method of societal analysis which has been used to critique Capitalism. There are various essays noting its founder and Abraham Lincoln exchanged letters during the American civil war. Lincoln is also the marque for the Ford Motor Company\'s luxury vehicles, capitalist status symbols throughout the late 20th century. Its juxtaposition with Marxism is thus particularly ironic.\nHyundai Climax - In this context, an orgasm. The title text finds an excuse to add another "x" with the model SexClimax.\nPorsche Zizek9000 - A portmanteau referencing academic Slavoj \xc5\xbdi\xc5\xbeek and the Saab 9000\nLexus 3&#215;3Cutrix - 3&#215;3 is a play on 4&#215;4; this car presumably has 3 wheels. "Executrix" (in leet "3&#215;3Cutrix") is the female counterpart of "executor", one who administers a will.\nAcura PizzaJazz - The letter Z has a very high score, so using 4 of them in a fairly short name makes this a potential hit.\nFord SixAxle 4&#215;4 - A contradictory name, as the 4&#215;4 refers to a vehicle that has all four wheels connected to the drivetrain, which would only use two axles. May also be a reference to the Sony PlayStation\'s Sixaxis controller.\nToyota Cervixxx - A portmanteau of cervix and XXX rating used by pornographic industry to make titles seem more extreme (see X rating). It being the highest scoring item on the list may be an attempt to show that sex sells.\n\nNote that Randall gives the symbol &#215; the value of 126, which means he equates it with the letter x.\n\nindex(3&#215;3Cutrix) = (+55 + score(&#215;) +55 +27 -68 -18 +8 -21 +126)/9/10 = 3.22. This means that the score of the symbol &#215; is 90&#215;3.22 - 164 = 125.8\n\nTitle text\n\nAs mentioned in the comic, the index for the word "climax" is 2.48. However, applying the index to the phrase "sexclimax" yields a value of 2.72, higher than that for "climax".\n\n
