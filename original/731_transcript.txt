n\nThis comic is making the point that there is a wonderful world waiting to be explored in the ocean. From above it seems so plain, endless, and boring. But underneath the surface lies the most unexplored area on the planet. This comic is a commentary on the need to head below the waves and start exploring.\nCueball sits (maybe writing in a diary?) on a desert island which is really a mountain of which only the sandy tip with a palm tree on it stands above the water. Beneath the surface is:\n\n A kelp forest \n Three sharks \n A stingray\n An eel\n A shipwreck\n A submarine following a small school of fish (it should be noted that if Cueball tried, he could make contact with the submarine and get home)\n Three large jellyfish\n A giant squid fighting a sperm whale\n A crashed plane\n Coral formations\n A thermal vent emitting a plume of smoke surrounded by several annelids\n A snail\n\nThe most important items from the title text are:\n\nA bathyscaphe is a deep sea submersible: a submarine for exploring the ocean floor.\nSome Scottish loch are very deep, especially those in the Great Glen. There may also be a reference to the famous Loch Ness.\nThe Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed when wind blowing over the bridge caused it to oscillate wildly. When the oscillations changed from one mode to another, they grew in amplitude until the bridge failed dramatically.\nCharles Minard did a visualization of the losses incurred by Napoleons army in its attempt to conquer Russia.\n\nThe title text itself is a poem:\n\nTelescopes and bathyscaphes\nand sonar probes of Scottish lakes,\nTacoma Narrows bridge collapse\nexplained with abstract phase-space maps,\nsome x-ray slides, a music score,\nMinard\'s Napoleonic war:\nthe most exciting new frontier\nis charting what\'s already here.\n\n
