n\nIngress is an augmented reality location-based service game in which players have to visit certain real-world places marked by the game as containing in-game objectives called portals. The single guy in the comic owns a home surrounded by an abundance of portals, which makes it an attractive destination for the three friends who contact him via the computer. They are obviously not really friends of the guy, but just wish to come by because of the portals.\nThe portals in the comic are controlled by the green "Enlightened" team (and have links and a field), making them targets for the blue "Resistance" team.\nFoursquare, referenced in the title text, is another service that lets users check into places they visit for discounts in a similar way to how Ingress players visit portals for points. Unlike Foursquare places, which are businesses and public places such as parks, Ingress portals also include historic houses that are still private residences, as well as churches, so Ingress is more likely to reward people visiting a friend\'s house. "Space noises" refers to the ambient sounds when playing Ingress.\n\n
