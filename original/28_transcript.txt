n\nThe basis for this fairly simple xkcd comic is the subject riddle, which is properly answered, as given in the title text: "Hell if I know". When spoken, this "correct" answer sounds like "elefino" \xe2\x80\x93 a portmanteau of "elephant" and "rhino". This makes it again one of the early comics where Randall explains the comic via the title text.\nInstead of giving the punchline of the joke, Randall answers with the unexpected "I haven\'t a goddamn clue", which, while having the same meaning, ruins the joke. This is akin to the way Biff Tannen in the Back to the Future film series says "make like a tree and get out of here" (rather than the proper "make like a tree and leave" [leaf]).\n\n
