n\nThe comic shows Randall\'s mother telling Randall that he can have a snack between meals only when his age is "one less than a multiple of three". This means the child starts getting snacks when he turns 2 years old, then stops getting them when he turns 3. Then he starts again getting snacks when he turns 5 but stops when he turns 6. This cycle repeats every 3 years, so the kid gets snacks when his age is 2, 5, 8, 11, etc. (one every 3 years).\nIt\'s difficult to defend this policy with a reasonable argument; and the first impression is that the mother just made up the rule for some obscure, unknown reason. However, the title text explains that Randall\'s mother actually enforced this rule on him, and his mother claims that, at the time, there was a valid reason for it (though the reason is not explained in the comic). The caption says that Randall has figured out that his nerdiness as an adult comes (at least in part) from his mother\'s strange rules.\n\n
