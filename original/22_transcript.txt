n\nIn the first two comics in the Barrel series, the boy is floating in the ocean in a barrel, making fairly innocent points about life\'s uncertainty. In this comic the view has zoomed out considerably and the boy is seen to be on the edge of a gigantic whirlpool. Thus, there is now a palpably heightened sense of danger, though the boy\'s reaction continues to be innocent wonder. \nThe comic\'s visual composition is reminiscent of a classic 1919 illustration by Harry Clarke, made for Edgar Allan Poe\'s 1841 short story "A Descent into the Maelstr\xc3\xb6m." In the short story, the main character escapes from drowning by using a barrel to escape The Maelstr\xc3\xb6m. \nThis is the third in a six-part series of comics whose parts were randomly published during the first several dozen strips. The series features a character that is not consistent with what would quickly become the xkcd stick figure style. The character is in a barrel.\nAfter Randall released the full The Boy and his Barrel story on xkcd it has been clear that the original Ferret story should also be included as part of the barrel series.\nThe full series can be found here. But below they are listed in the order Randall has put them in his collection linked to above:\n\n 1: Barrel - Part 1\n 20: Ferret\n 11: Barrel - Part 2\n 22: Barrel - Part 3\n 25: Barrel - Part 4\n 31: Barrel - Part 5\n\n
