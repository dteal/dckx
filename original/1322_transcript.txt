n\nBeret Guy and Cueball are walking. Beret Guy is making several remarks about the situation. The sky is blue or the air is cold, there is ice to walk on, and the birds are chirping in the trees. When making these observations, however, he does not use the conventional terms. Instead he uses word compounds, similar to "Up Goer Five". When Cueball brings up Beret Guy\'s odd vocabulary, he retorts by declaring that the name does not matter, as long as the things themselves are what they should be. This is the same concept that is communicated in the line from the Shakespearean play, "Romeo and Juliet": "What\'s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet." The concept is similar to that discussed by Richard Feynman as the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.[1]\nIn the title text Beret Guy continues to use playful language and offers affectionate encouragement: "stay warm, little flappers", demonstrating that his intentions are kind, not obfuscatory. Additionally, it is an indirect salutation from Randall Munroe to the readers, acknowledging the remarkably cold temperatures North America was experiencing at the time.\nDictionary\n\nThe sky is cold: it\'s a clear, cold day\nfloor water: puddle\ntoo hard to drink: frozen\nhandcoats: mittens or gloves\nspacelight: sunlight\nflappy planes: birds\nbeeping: chirping\nstick towers: trees\nlittle flappers: baby birds\nplant eggs: seeds, berries\n\n\n\n
