n\nRoomba is a brand of domestic cleaning robots manufactured by the company iRobot. The robots are designed to automatically vacuum floors. Although these robots are controlled by a quite simple software without any artificial intelligence, some owners tend to humanize them in the same way that others humanize their pets. There are several other comics related to a Roomba.\nMegan presents a pet carrier to Cueball the veterinarian assistant. She says that her "dog" is \xe2\x80\x9ccrawling around eating dirt\xe2\x80\x9d, which sounds like certain types of behavioral problems one encounters in dogs, but is precisely what Roombas are made for. What makes the comic even more hilarious is that when the vet comments that it is a Roomba, Megan responds that the device (which has nothing to do with an animal) is a cross-breed, and agrees that there probably is \xe2\x80\x9csome Roomba\xe2\x80\x9d in it. She thus acknowledges the existence of Roombas, but still treats them as if it were an animal. It\'s common to talk about domestic dogs this way, but cross-breeding dogs with machines is impossible&#91;citation needed&#93;. The vet then goes on to say, with endless patience, that a Roomba is not a pet. This is taken by Megan as if the doctor said that her Roomba-like device is a non-domesticated animal (like a monkey, a fox, or the birds referred to in the title text) that can but should not be kept in captivity. In the last panel she consequently releases the vacuum cleaner and it whirs to its \'freedom\'.\nThe second customer, Hairy, has his dog on a leash, but is also carrying a pet transporter for the dog. Most likely he has arrived with the dog in the transporter (perhaps using public transportation) but has now taken it out so it can walk for itself, making the carrier much lighter.\nThe Migratory Bird Treaty act from the title text contains a list of over 800 bird species that are not allowed to be captured or killed. If the Roomba were to be classified as a native American bird and were added to the list, keeping them as pets would constitute capturing and would be considered illegal. This, of course, shows how confused Megan is. She previously stated the Roomba to be a dog and now apparently believes it is a bird, even though dogs are not birds and the Roomba is neither.\n\n
