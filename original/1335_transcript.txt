n\nThe picture is divided in 24 segments representing the 24 hours of the day. At noon and at midnight the break between segments is indicated by the tip of a brown triangle.\nThe picture rotates by 3.75 degrees every 15 minutes, as does the Earth, so that it is constantly up to date in showing which regions are currently at which times of day. The picture change seems to happen half-way through a 15-minute time increment (that is, at 7\xc2\xbd, 22\xc2\xbd, 37\xc2\xbd, and 52\xc2\xbd minutes after each hour), so that the picture is always correct for the nearest multiple of 15 minutes.\nThe map projection of the earth in the middle of the picture shows an azimuthal equidistant projection with the South Pole in the center. This is unusual, as the projection typically puts the north pole in the center, but necessary in order for it to rotate clockwise. Randall was playing on projections before in 977: Map Projections.\nThe list of cities and countries doesn\'t match the map exactly - notice how the continent of Australia is shifted counterclockwise of the words "most Australian cities". This is because the map is centered relative to the time zones and the local variations therein. The map shows the configuration of time zones with respect to daylight saving time (also known as summer time) at the time of the comic\'s initial release (February 2014); it was being observed in parts of Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and other countries not named in this comic. If the map were to stay accurate through the year, the location of place names would have to move over the next few months as parts of the southern hemisphere went off DST and parts of the northern hemisphere went onto it; however, the map failed to change on the morning of March 9 as it should have (to recognize the start of DST in North America).\nIn many countries "business hours" are considered to be from 9&#160;am to 5&#160;pm. With some exceptions, including emergencies, it is generally considered rude to place a telephone call to someone\'s residence during the hours when most people are asleep; Randall portrays this time period as extending from 10 pm to 8 am.  This may be a reference to the 10 pm "cutoff" time discussed in an episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm."\nOn midnight at UTC we can see this situation:\n\n00:00 UTC Greenwich Mean Time\n\nUK, Portugal\nWest Africa\n\n\n01:00 UTC Central European Time\n\nMost of central Europe\nNigeria, and many more countries belonging to the West Africa Time zone\n\n\n02:00 UTC Eastern European Time\n\nEastern Europe, many countries like Bulgaria, Romania or Greece\nThe Levant\nEgypt\n\n\n03:00 UTC UTC+03:00 (East Africa Time, Eastern Europe Forward Time, and Arabia Standard Time)\n\nEthiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Somalia, and more\nKaliningrad and Belarus\nIraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and more.\nIran is at Iran Standard Time, using an offset of UTC+03:30\n\n\n04:00 UTC UTC+04:00\n\nMoscow Time\nUnited Arab Emirates, Mauritius, and more\nAfghanistan is at Time in Afghanistan, using an offset of UTC+04:30\nIran is at Iran Standard Time, using an offset of UTC+03:30\n\n\n05:00 UTC UTC+05:00\n\nPakistan, Western Australia, Maldives and some France former colonies.\nAfghanistan is at Time in Afghanistan, using an offset of UTC+04:30\nIndia and Sri Lanka using UTC+05:30\nNepal is using a much more odd offset at UTC+05:45\n\n\n06:00 UTC UTC+06:00\n\nBangladesh, Bhutan...\nUK British Indian Ocean Territory\nRussia at Yekaterinburg Time, also Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan\nChina only use one time zone (+08:00) but Xinjiang and Tibet unofficially use +06:00 \nIndia and Sri Lanka using UTC+05:30\nNepal is using a much more odd offset at UTC+05:45\n\n\n07:00 UTC UTC+07:00\n\nSouth-east Asia like Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and more\nChristmas Island belonging to Australia\nRussia is also using the Omsk Time\n\n\n08:00 UTC UTC+08:00\n\nWestern Australia\nChina uses only one time zone while the country spans about five.\nSingapore\nPhilippines\nPerth\n\n\n09:00 UTC UTC+09:00\n\nJapan\nThe Koreas\n\n\n10:00 UTC UTC+10:00\n\nBrisbane and the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria\nUS: Guam and Northern Mariana Islands\n\n\n11:00 UTC UTC+11:00\n\nMicronesia, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu\nRussia Vladivostok Time\n\n\n12:00 UTC UTC+12:00 or UTC\xe2\x88\x9212:00\n\nKamchatka (a Russian peninsula at the east Siberia), Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Tuvalu and more\n\n\n13:00 UTC UTC+13:00 or UTC\xe2\x88\x9211:00\n\nNew Zealand, Kiribati, Tonga\n\n\n14:00 UTC UTC+14:00 or UTC\xe2\x88\x9210:00\n\nHawaii, Samoa\nFrench Polynesia, Cook Islands, and more\nLine Islands, belonging to Kiribati\n\n\n15:00 UTC UTC\xe2\x88\x9209:00\n\nAlaska (some islands of Alaska is at -10:00 and a few city\'s are at -08:00)\nFrench Polynesia \n\n\n16:00 UTC UTC\xe2\x88\x9208:00 or Pacific Time Zone\n\nUS West Coast\nCanada or (British Columbia and Yukon)\nMexico (Baja California)\n\n\n17:00 UTC UTC\xe2\x88\x9207:00 or Mountain Time Zone\n\nUS: Denver, and much more\nCanada: Alberta (Calgary, Edmonton), British Columbia, more\n\n\n18:00 UTC UTC\xe2\x88\x9206:00 or Central Time Zone\n\nMexico, Chile, Ecuador, Nicaragua and more\nUS: Chicago, Texas except of some most westernmost counties, and many more\n\n\n19:00 UTC UTC\xe2\x88\x9205:00 or Eastern Time Zone\n\nEastern Canada like Ontario or Quebec\nUS East Coast including New York and Florida.\nBut also Cuba, Haiti, Panama and much more countries\n\n\n20:00 UTC UTC\xe2\x88\x9204:00 or Atlantic Time Zone\n\nCanadian Maritimes: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia.
