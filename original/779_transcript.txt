n\nSome people are upset about airport security policies that mandate the use of backscatter X-ray machines, since the machines can create an image of the subject naked. Black Hat is selling Viagra for men as means to thumb their noses (so to speak) at the system by forcing the security guard to see them with erections. The problem with this approach is that the time spent in a line of this length will be far too short for the Viagra to have any effect whatsoever. However, judging by the security guard\'s thought bubble, he indeed is not looking forward to the images.\nAt the title text, one of the people in the line explains has a fetish with getting X-ray scanned, and so thus doesn\'t need Viagra to achieve the above effect.\n\n
