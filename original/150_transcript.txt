n\nRandall is playing with the child/grownup setup again. During childhood, adults ("grownups") make most of the decisions and put constraints on what their children do. As children age and eventually become grownups, there are some things that they do not do anymore, as they see them as childish. \nMegan has taken these thoughts seriously, and realizes that with her newfound freedom as a grownup, she gets to define what her adulthood means. Free from constraints, she goes ahead and creates a ball pit in her apartment of colored plastic balls. Cueball admires this spirit and enters the ball pit. It is difficult to decipher Randall\'s true intent behind this somewhat cryptic comic, but it seems from the heart that the two are making love in the balls.\nThe trend with adults participating in children\'s activities is continued in 219: Blanket Fort. And with adults that feel like children while doing adult things as in 616: Lease which references this comic in the title text.\nThe title text reveals that Randall also would like to make his own ball pit, but he finds it expensive to buy and also hard to keep clean. Both of these are true - see links. Most public ball pits can easily become very dirty as many children and toddlers play in them.\n\n
