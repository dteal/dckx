n\nBertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead co-wrote the Principia Mathematica, with the intention of cataloging all of mathematics and ridding it of contradiction and self-reference. Kurt G\xc3\xb6del later showed that such a system is impossible, and that any system of axioms (complex enough to represent arithmetic) is incomplete.\nHere, Russell and Whitehead are perusing a more salacious, but no less comprehensive, task: compiling a list of all sexual fetishes. When G\xc3\xb6del says he likes "anything not on your list," Russel and Whitehead have no way to complete their list. Whatever they leave off should be on the list, as long as it\'s off the list. This paradox is essentially the same as the one that doomed the Principia.\nIn the title text, Georg Cantor is the inventor of set theory. If you have a fetish for doing everything in the book twice, then that belongs in the book, which you then have to do once more, which adds another item to the book ad infinitum. Russel and Whitehead finally acknowledge their defeat.\nThere is a fetish roadmap by Katharine Gates, author of Deviant Desires and DeviantDesires.com.\nAn earlier comic also refers to Kurt G\xc3\xb6del: 24: Godel, Escher, Kurt Halsey.\n\n
