n\nThis comic is a reference to the comic book and movie character Batman, who is actually wealthy playboy Bruce Wayne, as we see on the left being referenced as "Master Wayne" by his butler Alfred. Batman, in contrast to Superman and other comic book heroes, has no superpowers \xe2\x80\x94 he\'s just an ordinary guy in a bat costume, or "a man dressed like a bat." Despite the accuracy of this description, it sounds pretty stupid if you take a serious line and replace "Batman" with "a man dressed like a bat."\nIn the middle is the stick figure representation of Batman and on the right is the Joker, as played by the late Heath Ledger. Each of these is an actual scene from a Batman film - specifically, the Dark Knight Trilogy - with the subject text replaced. In this way, Randall is pointing out that Batman commands a lot of respect and fear considering that all he is is a man in a costume.\nThen in the title text, Randall expresses his fear that Christopher Nolan (the director/producer/writer of the latest Batman trilogy) was going to kill Batman off in the then-upcoming movie Dark Knight Rises. Of course, Randall substitutes for "Batman" as in the comic. This causes a grammatical ambiguity which Randall points out where the "dressed like a bat" could apply to the "man" or to Nolan. A similar ambiguity explicitly discussed in the title text of 1087: Cirith Ungol.\nThere has been several comics using substitutions, but this may have been the first.\n\n
