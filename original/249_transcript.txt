n\nA roller coaster is a kind of thrill ride where a small train carries people through a number of twists, turns, and hills at a high speed to the occupants\' great delight. Such rides are popular at amusement parks where people have to wait in long lines to get on a ride that can last less than two minutes.\nMany amusement parks have a spot where they take souvenir pictures as you are experiencing the ride. After you get off the ride, you can buy one, or a set to commemorate riding the roller coaster. These pictures usually have people with their hands up, yelling and screaming. Wind may be going through their hair as they pass through the air at high speeds. \nCueball is subverting the usual \'souvenir picture pose\' by gluing chess pieces to a board and then staring at the board when the picture is taken. He stands out in the picture as a calm person studiously studying a chess problem while everyone else yelps and whoops with excitement.\nThe title text refers to blindfold chess, which doesn\'t require any actual blindfold, it\'s just called that way because the two players don\'t need a board and just communicate their moves. This would of course be impossible to photograph.\n\n
