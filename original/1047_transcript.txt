n\nThis comic lists some approximations for numbers, most of them mathematical and physical constants, but some of them jokes and cultural references.\nApproximations like these are sometimes used as mnemonics by mathematicians and physicists, though most of Randall\'s approximations are too convoluted to be useful as mnemonics.  Perhaps the best known mnemonic approximation (though not used here by Randall) is that "pi is approximately equal to 22/7".  Randall does mention (and mock) the common mnemonic among physicists that the fine structure constant is approximately 1/137.  Although Randall gives approximations for the number of seconds in a year, he does not mention the common physicist\'s mnemonic that it is "pi times 10^7," though he later added a statement to the top of the comic page addressing this point. \nAt the bottom of the comic are expressions involving transcendental numbers (namely pi and e) that are tantalizingly close to being exactly true but are not (indeed, they cannot be, due to the nature of transcendental numbers).  Such near-equations were previously discussed in 217: e to the pi Minus pi.  One of the entries, though, is a "red herring" that is exactly true.  \nRandall says he compiled this table through "a mix of trial-and-error, Mathematica, and Robert Munafo\'s Ries tool.  "Ries" is a "reverse calculator" that forms equations matching a given number.\nThe first part of the title text notes that "Jenny\'s constant," which is actually a telephone number referenced in Tommy Tutone\'s 1982 song 867-5309/Jenny, is not only prime but a twin prime because 8675311 is also a prime. Twin primes have always been a subject of interest, because they are comparatively rare, and because it is not yet known whether there are infinitely many of them.  Twin primes were also referenced in 1310: Goldbach Conjectures. \nThe second part of the title text makes fun of the unusual mathematical operations contained in the comic.  Pi is a useful number in many contexts, but it doesn\'t usually occur anywhere in an exponent. Even when it does, such as with complex numbers, taking the pi-th root is rarely helpful.  Similarly, e typically appears in the basis of a power (forming the exponential function), not in the exponent. (This is later referenced in Lethal Neutrinos).\n\n\n\n\nThing to be approximated:\n\nFormula proposed:\n\nResulting approximate value:\n\nCorrect value:\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\nOne light year(m)\n\n998\n\n9,227,446,944,279,201\n\n9,460,730,472,580,800 (exact)\n\n998 and 698 are sexual references.\n\n\nEarth Surface(m2)\n\n698\n\n513,798,374,428,641\n\n5.10072*1014\n\n998 and 698 are sexual references.\n\n\nOcean\'s volume(m3)\n\n919\n\n1,350,851,717,672,992,089\n\n1,332*1018\n\n\n\n\nSeconds in a year\n\n754\n\n31,640,625\n\n31,557,600 (Julian calendar) 31,556,952 (Gregorian calendar)\n\nAfter this comic was released Randall got many responses by viewers. So he did add this statement to the top of the comic page:\n"Lots of emails mention the physicist favorite, 1 year = pi x 107 seconds. 754 is a hair more accurate, but it\'s hard to top 3,141,592\'s elegance." Pi x 107 is nearly equal to 31,415,926.536, and 754 is exactly 31,640,625. Randall\'s elegance belongs to the number pi, but it should be multiplied by the factor of ten.\n\nUsing the traditional definitions that a second is 1/60th of a minute, a minute is 1/60th of an hour, and an hour is 1/24th of a day, a 365-day year is exactly 31,536,000 seconds (the "for rent method" approximation). Until the calendar was reformed by Pope Gregory, there was one leap year in every four years, making the average year 365.25 days, or 31,557,600. On the current calendar system, there are only 97 leap years in every 400 years, making the average year 365.2425 days, or 31,556,952 seconds. In technical usage, a "second" is now defined based on physical constants, even though the length of a day varies inversely with the changing angular velocity of the earth.  To keep the official time synchronized with the rotation of the earth, a "leap second" is occasionally added, resulting in a slightly longer year.\n\n\n\nSeconds in a year (rent method)\n\n525,600 x 60\n\n31,536,000\n\n31,557,600 (Julian calendar) 31,556,952 (Gregorian calendar)\n\n"Rent Method" refers to the song "Seasons of Love" from the musical "Rent." The song asks, "How do you measure a year?" One line says "525,600 minutes" while most of the rest of the song suggests the best way to measure a year is moments shared with a loved one.\n\n\nAge of the universe (seconds)\n\n1515\n\n437,893,890,380,859,375\n\n4.354\xc2\xb10.012*1017 (best estimate; exact value unknown)\n\n\n\n\nPlanck\'s constant\n\n1/(30\xcf\x80e)\n\n6.68499014108082*10\xe2\x88\x9234 (rounded)\n\n6.62606957*10\xe2\x88\x9234\n\nInformally, the Planck constant is the smallest action possible in quantum mechanics.\n\n\nFine structure constant\n\n1/140\n\n0.00
