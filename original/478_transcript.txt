n\nOptimistic Beret Guy can never take life seriously. He loves to play with everything, and nothing is more exciting than a tool that sticks things together with an impressive kaCHUNK sound when he pulls the trigger, even on things that (definitely) shouldn\'t be stapled.&#91;citation needed&#93;\nInstalling Debian is a pun on the installation of software, and the installation of real life things by attaching them to things.  \nThis comic may reference an engineering truism describing a similar scenario: "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail". The truism\'s actual meaning refers to the scenario where when a novice has only learned to use one tool (such as one programming language), they may attempt to solve all problems using only that tool, which may end badly.\nFrom just reading the comic by itself, one may presume that in the last panel, Cueball has been stapled to the ceiling (as obvious evidence to Megan that Beret Guy has indeed been abusing her staple gun). According to the comic\'s official transcript, however, it is in fact God who is speaking. \nDuct tape, thanks to its combination of tensile and adhesive strength, is commonly regarded as the ultimate do-it-yourself repair tool. Like a staple gun, it can also be used to stick things together. Although it does make a nice sound when pulling a strip out quickly, it does not make a loud kaCHUNK sound upon fixing two objects together.\nIn 291: Dignified Beret Guy hangs upside down, and says (in the title text) that he has stapled his hat to his head to make it stay on. That may very well have been the inspiration for this comic.\n\n
