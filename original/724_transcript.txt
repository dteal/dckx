n\nTetris is a game where the player has to manipulate falling blocks into forming complete rows, which will then be deleted and give point to the player. This comic is a play on this, presenting the player with a version of the game with a curved bottom that renders forming rows nearly impossible. Hell is a mythological and/or religious concept of a posthumous punishment for wrongdoers, depicted in many religions as eternal torment. Here the Tetris player feels he is in Hell when he tries to play this game.\nThe title text presents similar situations where frustration is likely to occur. \nKatamari Damacy is a video game in which the player controls a sticky sphere which grows by assimilating objects smaller than itself - so extremely frustrating if none of the objects available is smaller than your sphere.\nSuper Mario is a long-running franchise of platforming games; in most of the games which utilize a 3-dimensional engine, levels are completed by collecting large, golden stars - so very frustrating if one is impossible to reach.\nThe last part may also be a suggestion to the Greek depiction of Tantalus in hell; he tried to reach fruit on a tree but every time he grasped for the fruit the branches bent away.\nAlso see comic 888: Heaven, which presents an opposing situation in which the game is trying to help the player win.\nThere is a playable version of this comic at Kongregate, which, unsurprisingly, is frustratingly difficult (but not impossible) to play.\n\n
