n\nThis comic appears to be satirizing art in two different ways. From one perspective, Randall is describing various art forms in unusual ways (e.g., a portrait by Cueball, a video for the unidentified girl with short hair, and perhaps live performance by Ponytail). From another perspective, Randall might be making fun of time-lapse photography movies. YouTube has a robust collection of videos taken from stitching together pictures or short video clips taken every day or every week; in the 2015 Academy Awards, one of the Best Picture nominees, Boyhood, used a similar method, filming short sequences annually over the course of 12 years.\nIn each case, the art described is simpler than it sounds, and some might not consider it art. A picture of oneself "every hundred years" will only happen once (or maybe twice); a "picture every 1/24th of a second" is the traditional frame rate of cinema cameras for film production, and "watching my face age in real time" is just life.\nThen finally Megan pokes fun at all of them by simply watching their attempts at "art" while she eats a burrito. Randall may also be referencing the many perspectives on art by leaving this comic open to several interpretations.\nThe use of a burrito as a punchline representing someone who is grounded in reality instead of engaging in esoteric pursuits has been seen before in 1269: Privacy Opinions.\nThe title text is just more snark, claiming that it\'s Megan\'s most ambitious project ever, if the sole criterion for ambition is the amount of guacamole that one has to eat.\n\n
