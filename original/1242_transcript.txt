n\nThis chart humorously explores how things are often named colloquially and without regard to accuracy in correlating actual scariness with apparent scariness. It is interesting to note how people react to the items near the bottom right of the chart "scary things with not-very-scary names" when compared to how they may react to items in the upper left "not-very-scary things with scary names". Some of the entries on the chart are especially interesting examples considering that portions of the names that are associated with significant historical or cultural events and themes. i.e. Chernobyl Packet, Demon Core. All items are described in the table below including the title text on Helvetica Scenario.\nOn the chart, things toward the right are scary/dangerous/very bad, while things toward the top sound scary without necessarily being scary.\nNote that Randall uses similar diagrams in both 388: Fuck Grapefruit and 1501: Mysteries which also contain different items.\n\n
