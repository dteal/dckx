n\nIn this fourth "My Hobby" strip, the hobby is mixing curse levels. Curse words (aka: swear words/profanities) are disrespectful words that are typically impolite to use in public. As noted in the strip, there are "levels" of curse words ranging from those "mild" words which are more acceptable to use, to those "severe" words which are considered very impolite (the milder curse words can be used on network television in the US, for example, while severe ones can not). One usually uses milder cursing because either they personally don\'t feel comfortable using the more severe words, or because it would not be appropriate in the context (such as on network television, in the presence of children, etc.) Thus, mixing mild and severe curses in one usage does not usually occur, as the effect achieved by keeping the one curse word mild is negated by using another which is severe.\nIn a mild curse "gosh-darned" is typically used as a mild version of "God-damned" when the latter would be inappropriate. This is mixed with "cunt" \xe2\x80\x94 a vulgar term for the female genitalia which is one of the most severe curse words.\n\n
