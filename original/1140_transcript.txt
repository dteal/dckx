n\nThe calendar used in the comic is the standard Gregorian calendar used by most of Western Civilization. The comic looks at the frequencies of which dates appear in English writings indexed in the Google Books Library Project, by using the Google Ngram Viewer (link).\nSome dates are more (or less) frequently mentioned because they have a special significance. Other dates have correlations for which there doesn\'t appear to be any obvious reasons. September 11th, which is noted in the title text for being popular before the 9/11 attack, has also been the date of 2 significant battles in the War of 1812, one where the British landed in what was George Washington\'s large plantation, which likely contributed to its search volume.\nThe date mentioned in the sub-heading (October 17th) is Randall\'s birthday.\nThe title text mystery is explained here. In summary, many occurrences of "11th" in the writings were actually misread by the Google Books Library Project\'s optical character recognition software and/or reCAPTCHA users, becoming one of these: IIth, Ilth, iith, lith, llth, 1lth, 1ith, l1th, or, in texts after 1860, nth.  In addition, the slightly lower frequencies of 2nd, 3rd, 22nd, and 23rd are due to the 19th Century practice of writing these numbers as 2d, 23d, etc.\n\n
