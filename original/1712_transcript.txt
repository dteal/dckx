n\nThe website PolitiFact.com rates political claims based on how true they are. The rulings from the Truth-O-Meter\xe2\x84\xa2 at PolitiFact are:\n\nTrue\nMostly True\nHalf-True\nMostly False\nFalse\nPants on Fire!\n\nThis comic presents a woman wearing a white hat with a press pass in the hat\'s belt. She is calling herself "PolitiFact" -- either pretending to come from PolitiFact.com or she is representing a personification of the website itself. She is obviously annoying Megan and Cueball by rating everything they say on the Truth-O-Meter. (She is using the official logo of PolitiFact as her name, and since they write their name PolitiFact her name should also be written like this, even though Randall has named the comic Politifact with all lower case letters and also uses it like this in the title text.)\nWhen Megan, apparently just having gotten out of bed, says she had trouble sleeping, the PolitiFact.com woman (called PolitiFact from now on) appears at an open window and observes that Megan is telling the truth with the rating of "Mostly True!" (So according to PolitiFact she did not sleep well most of the night, but may have slept OK for some parts of the night...) \nMegan appears distressed, which is not improved when PolitiFact enters their house through the window. Megan give chase to PolitiFact, passing by Cueball, whose comment Not again makes it clear that this is not the first time PolitiFact has annoyed them in this way. Megan swears that she had locked the window, which if true would mean that PolitiFact had illegally opened a locked window. PolitiFact gives that claim the rating of "False!", indicating that the window was unlocked. Entering someone\'s house against their wishes is illegal the state of their windows non-withstanding, and Cueball clearly asks her to leave, apart from the fact that Megan chases her through their house.\nAfter the chase, PolitiFact ends up hiding under the couple\'s bed; Cueball\'s claim that PolitiFact "can\'t stay under there forever" is promptly rated "False". Megan\'s remark, however, that no one likes PolitiFact, is rated "Mostly True!" If interpreted as claim about the person, PolitiFact acknowledges that what she does annoys people, but she keeps on doing it anyway.\nIf Megan is commenting on the popularity of the website, PolitiFact is still correct. People become very defensive when claims they make in political discussions are debunked by PolitiFact.com. There is a phenomenon where the people most influenced by an erroneous claim are the least likely to believe a fact checker. For example, The Washington Post shut down their internet rumor fact checker because, "institutional distrust is so high right now, and cognitive bias so strong always, that the people who fall for hoax news stories are frequently only interested in consuming information that conforms with their views \xe2\x80\x94 even when it\'s demonstrably fake."  Simply put, people like the idea of a fact checker until they disagree with it.  \nPolitiFact.com has been accused of being both liberally biased and conservatively biased at various times and has angered politicians on both sides of the aisle.  The summary statistic "rulings" are especially troublesome; often the critics will agree that the information presented by the fact check is correct, and may agree that all relevant information has been included, but will disagree as to the importance of context omitted by the original speaker or the interpretation of ambiguous language.\nThe title text makes a play on PolitiFact.com\'s most untrue rating, "Pants on Fire!" - a reference to the childhood accusation "Liar, liar, pants on fire!" \nIn the title text either Cueball or Megan says to the other that they have lit the smoke bomb and rolled it under the bed near PolitiFact (seems they have discussed this first). When it goes off it apparently manages to ignite PolitiFact\'s pants - thus, PolitiFact\'s pants are literally on fire and she yells "PANTS ON FIRE!". Cueball has thrown smoke bombs before while in a relation with Megan, see 486: I am Not a Ninja, so it would be likely he had a smoke bomb on his person for immediate use.\nAlternatively, either Cueball or Megan just says this as a threat (they could even roll a non-bomb object under the bed and maybe they have talked out loud about the idea of using such a bomb before) and they could try to make the loud fwooosh sound themselves to simulate that the bomb going off. Then they would be telling an outright lie that would be rated as "Pants on Fire!". The fact that the fwooosh is located outside of the "quotation marks", is no indication as the sound is not part of the quote. Also the fact that "PANTS ON FIRE" is yelled, rather than calmly delivered in the fashion of her other judgments, is not necessarily any indication that this is not the case, since a threat that is so blatantly a lie as to warrant such a rating should be proclaimed out loud.\nIt may be a coincidence, but PolitiFact.com was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 2009 for work done in their first full year of work (after it was started in August 2007), and this comic was released right after 1711: Snapchat, which hinges on the existence of little-known Pulitzer Prize categories.\n\n
