The transcript explanation should thus be moved to the explanation and a real transcript should be made instead.If you can address this issue, please edit the page! Thanks.\n\nThe movies referenced are (links go to Wikipedia):\n\nLord of the Rings Trilogy\nStar Wars (original Trilogy)\nJurassic Park\n12 Angry Men (there are two movies "12 Angry Men" on the same topic)\nPrimer\n\nThe joke in the 12 Angry Men graphic is that in the movie all 12 jurors are all in the same room the entire movie. They never move and they all always interact with each other, hence their lines stay straight and close to each other.\nThe last box is a movie called Primer from 2004, which became a cult classic.  It is about a group of engineers who discover a way to time travel, but only in one direction (backwards) and only at the speed of regular time (i.e. you have to stay in the time machine for one hour to move an hour back in time). Because of this, the story ends up having multiple versions of the same person existing at the same time; the plot and time-travel mechanics are notoriously hard to follow, so that it is almost impossible to figure out where each character is at one time, as the comic illustrates.\nThese charts are a reference to the map by infographic pioneer Charles Joseph Minard that details the movements and losses of Napoleon\'s troops on his failed conquest of Russia.\nThe chart for Primer is referenced in the title text of the fourth image in the what if? Plastic Dinosaurs.\n\n
