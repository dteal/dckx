n\nCrowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially from an online community, rather than from traditional employees or suppliers. Cueball "crowdsources" the process of getting a company and a prospective employee together. Cueball describes it as helping people with ideas find funding, via Kickstarter, but rather than setting up a system to facilitate the process he plans to use social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter). If Cueball\'s company is crowdsourcing this matchmaking then he\'s allowing the people to find a company on their own merit, his company is not involved in the process at all. Cueball seems to be describing this process with buzz-words to impress a group of people who could themselves be businesspeople.\nIn the title text Cueball states that instead of doing any work they play video games, "shooters" refer to first person shooters, for hours on end.\n\n
