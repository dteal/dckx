n\nThis comic refers to the song "Stacy\'s Mom", by Fountains of Wayne (See the music video on YouTube). As the background singers repeatedly say, "Stacy\'s mom has got it goin\' on." \nThe humor in this is that in the song the singer finds Stacy\'s Mom desirable, but in the comic the dad, who walked out, is saying that she is very undesirable and the singer should run away while he still can. "That woman has a lot going on" alludes directly to the first line of the chorus, but refers to the things that are going on in a negative, rather than a positive, light.\nThe title text elaborates on this idea, implying that she manipulated the singer to mow her lawn through rewarding the singer by making an appearance with "just a towel on."\nStacey\'s dad is drawn similarly to other early version of Hairy, making this his first appearance.\nThe song Stacy\'s Mom was again referenced in 575: Tag Combination.\n\n
