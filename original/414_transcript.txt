n\nThe Kama Sutra is a well-known work on human sexual behavior originally written in the language Sanskrit, in India sometime between 400 BC and 200 AD. It\'s not exclusively a "sex manual", as it also contains a guide to virtuous and gracious living, but in the Western world, it\'s primarily thought of as a manual of exotic sex positions.\nGiven that the Kama Sutra was written almost 2,000 years ago, it\'s doubtful that it has any references whatsoever to a skateboard ramp, but Cueball and Megan enjoy their badly-translated version of the Kama Sutra so much that they refuse to change it.\nThe title text is a call-back to 330: Indecision in which two male friends spend an hour or more having no idea what to do, and according to a book of rules, that means that they must default to sexual experimentation. One of them says he\'ll go get the Crisco, which is apparently to be used as a lubricant. Later Crisco was part of a weird dream mentioned in the title text of 557: Students.\n\n
