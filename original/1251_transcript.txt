n\nBlack Hat makes an attachment for eyeglasses which shines a laser light at people using Google Glass. The quote "The best defense is an indiscriminate offense" plays off the adage "The best defense is a good offense". Black Hat\'s goal seems to be to interfere with the Google Glass user potentially recording the person with the laser, and possibly blinding Google Glass users, undermining the project. By mailing one to the children of every Google executive who are likely to be Google Glass users, he\'s clearly aiming to disrupt the entire Google Glass project. Silicon Valley is a place where many technologically up-to-date people live who are more likely to use Google Glass.\nThe "viral marketing campaign" excuse seems to play off how battery-powered LED placards were mistaken for terrorism in the 2007 Boston bomb scare. He pretends that his terrorism is actually a viral marketing campaign, but seems to have not thought this excuse through. He then tries to get them to look into a laser light.\nThe title text shows the irony between Black Hat\'s needlessly complicated technical solution, and his apparent hate of Google Glass, a relatively new technology. In addition, he remarks that he wouldn\'t do something as old-fashioned as shining a laser in peoples\' eyes, as this does not live up to his technical expertise.\nHowever, he could shine a laser through the peephole, which would have the same effect on the police officers.\nIt seems generally that Randall is no fan of Google Glass, which was also shown later in 1304: Glass Trolling. It was the second time they are mentioned in xkcd after 1215: Insight, but this was the first direct mocking of people wearing these glasses. Google Glass has become a recurring theme in xkcd.\n\n
