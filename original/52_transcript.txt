n\nThe quote written in the large white bubbles comes from The Sandman, a comic book series about dreams. Neil Gaiman is a science fiction and fantasy author who came to fame for writing Sandman. \nThe interconnected bubbles represent the secret worlds of different people, and how they are connected, they may have the second meaning of the neurons in our brain.\nThe title text indicates that Randall used the Four color theorem, which states that a graph drawn on a flat plane (like this one) requires at most four colors so that each region differs from all of its neighbors. The comic uses four colors (red, yellow, green, blue). This clearly does not include the white bubbles with text.\n\n
