n\nGeorge Clinton is an American musician most famous for his funk music and wild hair style.\nHis recorded music features themes of space, sci-fi, technology and futurism. An example of his work most appropriate to this comic is the song "Mathematics" from the 1996 album T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M (The awesome power of a fully operational mothership)\n\n"I count the moments we\'re apart. And add them up mathematically \nand multiply them by the kisses supposedly I\'ve been missing. \nDivided by the attention not to mention the affection. \nSubtract that from your gross potential and see I ain\'t missin\' none. \nCause any percentage of you is as good the whole pie. \nAny fractions thereof brings dividends of interest. \nAny percentage of you is as good as the whole pie. \nAny fractions thereof brings dividends of love. \n\nI take the square root and get boxed in every time. \nWhen I know the shortest distance between two points is in a straight line. \nI\'ma go into you, I\'ma come into you two times, and carry the fun over the one to where we equal one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(Chorus 2x)\n\nAs Randall says, he had attempted to spread around an urban legend that George Clinton had a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics. However, the more Randall thought about this rumor, the more he found himself believing it was true. This behavior is related to Pseudologia fantastica, which is more commonly known as pathological or compulsive lying. This comic references the associated behavior that an "individual may be aware they are lying, or may believe they are telling the truth, being unaware that they are relating fantasies." These individuals may eventually stop the lie as demonstrated by the title text, which indicates that at some later time the individual realized that the rumor was not true, but wishes it to be so.\nThe equations on the board are Laplace transforms of functions.\n\n
