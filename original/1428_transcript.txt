n\nCueball appears to be at a job interview, proudly stating his motto to the interviewer Ponytail.\n"Move fast and break things" is a saying common in science and engineering industries. In that context, it means that making mistakes is a natural consequence of innovation in a highly competitive and complex environment. In particular, it was adopted by Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook (who even went as far as to say that \'breaking things\' is a necessary feature of moving \'fast enough\').\nWhile in software development it is unusual for any great harm to result from breaking things, the jobs listed in the comic are ones where there are serious consequences of mistakes. Some would result in dangerous or deadly situations, while others would just end up with broken packages etc. It\'s not clear what job Cueball is interviewing for; one suspects it\'s probably one that belongs in the \'breaking things is bad\' group.\nThe results of moving fast and breaking things for the listed jobs might include:\n\nFedEx driver - Injured/killed pedestrians, collisions with other vehicles, broken &amp; damaged packages\nCrane operator - Damage or destruction of load, dropping loads on people below, damage to crane\nSurgeon - Incorrect operations performed, removing wrong body parts, death of the patient\nAir Traffic Controller - Air collisions, travel disruption, chaos\nPharmacist - Handing out wrong drugs, resulting in illness or death\nMuseum Curator - Damage or destruction of items of historical or artistic significance, damage of the museum\nWaiter - Crockery broken, drinks or food spilled on customers, food tipped over people\nDog Walker - Injuring the pet, or preventing it from fulfilling its bodily functions (the major reason for a walk)\nOil Tanker Captain - Collisions between vessels, or tanker and port, or running aground, leading to oil spills and casualties\nViolinist - Ruining an ensemble\'s performance by playing too fast (with a higher tempo than fellow musicians), breaking the strings or body of the instrument\nMars Rover Driver - Breaking an incredibly important vehicle, preventing further exploration, and ruining an extremely expensive mission\nMassage Therapist - Injuring the client, breaking bones and ligaments.\n\nThe title text posits a morbid scenario where Cueball keeps running over funeral attendees, generating the need for more funerals.\n\n
