n\nThis comic references the dichotomy between the literal meaning of the phrase "I could care less" and its idiomatic meaning in American English as an expression of indifference, synonymous with "I couldn\'t care less." Many people argue that this use is incorrect and the phrase should only be "I couldn\'t care less," which is the original form of the expression and remains the standard form in British English. This is the opinion expressed, for example, by the Weird Al Yankovic song "Word Crimes": Like I could care less \nThat means you do care\nAt least a little\nHowever, linguists point out that the strict application of logic to an idiom is inappropriate: many expressions seem on the surface to mean the opposite of the meaning they are used to convey (e.g. "head over heels"), and they defend "I could care less" on those grounds. The psychologist Steven Pinker argues in The Language Instinct that the phrase is sarcastic (cf. "Big deal!"), while linguist John Lawler explains it as a "Negative Polarity Item," a phrase that is practically only used in negated form, allowing the explicit negation to be omitted (a pattern often found in French).\nIn this comic, Megan feels alone because there is unavoidable difference between her understanding of her own words and the listener\'s interpretation, so while she sees discussion of semantics as being of potentially high social and emotional value, she doesn\'t think it has objective value. However, ironically, at the end of the comic, the meaning of "I could care less" with regards to Ponytail\'s behavior is ambiguous: either Megan is brushing off Ponytail\'s pedantry because she doesn\'t care about it (she couldn\'t care less) or she is hurt by Ponytail\'s focus on the details of her words rather than the emotional cues she should have learned over the course of their relationship (she actually could care less).\nThe title text refers to another word often used in ways some consider incorrect: "literally" (see 725: Literally). The sentence is also ambiguous, as it may mean that \'literally\' or \'figuratively,\' the speaker could or couldn\'t care less. Further, it implies that Randall considers the argument over whether literally may be properly used to mean \'figuratively\' is petty in the same way. Later in 1735: Fashion Police and Grammar Police Ponytail is once again on the side of the grammar police and also in this comic the word literally is used.\nAlternatively, it could mean that Megan cares too much about Ponytail\'s correction, considering her response to it.\nIn a further alternative, the title text could amount to a self-ironical evaluation on Randall\xe2\x80\x99s part to the effect that he himself might be devoting too much of his time and energy to the meaning of the phrase in question, as evidenced by the comic itself.\nThe inverse image of Megan floating through space in the fourth panel, as well as her long introspection, is a reference to the five-part "Choices" series, starting at 264: Choices: Part 1.\n\n
