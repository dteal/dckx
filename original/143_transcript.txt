n\nThis comic is a part of the Parody Week, just joking about other webcomics. This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule and is comprised of the following five parodies:\n\n141: Parody Week: Achewood\n142: Parody Week: Megatokyo\n143: Parody Week: TFD and Natalie Dee\n144: Parody Week: A Softer World\n145: Parody Week: Dinosaur Comics\n\nThis comic parodies two comics in one go \nTFD is an acronym for Toothpaste For Dinner which is a daily one-panel cartoon written and drawn by Drew Fairweather. Each comic features small, simple drawings, paired with short captions or dialogue.\nNatalie Dee is the author of the daily comics Natalie Dee. This webcomic comprises various sketches illustrating amusing or anecdotal situations from every day life.\nDrew and Natalie are husband &amp; wife, and are also the authors of the webcomic Married to the Sea.\nIn similar style to their simple comics we see xkcd\'s Cueball ask the two creators of the two comics what\'s funny. The woman in color represents Natalie who do color drawings that could include animals, and she thinks bees are funny. The man is Drew drawn like his own characters with a weird head shape. He thinks tires are funny. Then Natalie combines those to say that bees with tires are funny, and he is like, whatever. \nThe title text points out that it would be funny to see bees with tires. This is because bees, like other living creatures, have no wheels.\n\n
