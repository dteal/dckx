n\nThis comic uses the starting lines of an innocent children\'s book and creates irony by delivering a dark message.\nIn the book Are You There God? It\'s Me, Margaret. by Judy Blume, the opening lines are "Are you still there, God? It\'s me, Margaret. I know you\'re there, God. I know you wouldn\'t have missed this for anything! Thank you, God. Thanks an awful lot..." These lines describe a prayer, in which Margaret privately speaks to God, expressing gratitude and seeking guidance.\nIn the second and third panels, Margaret asks God "Are you scared, God?", and states "You should be". This is similar to threats delivered in super violent action movies, such as Taken, in which the protagonist or antagonist speaks directly to their opponent, issuing threats and indicating that they are coming after their opponent. The final panel is a shot of Margaret standing imposingly in a dark landscape, and a caption over the top of the image says "Margaret is coming for you", making this comic reminiscent of an action movie trailer. The irony is that "Are You There, God? It\'s Me, Margaret." is a very innocent book, especially when compared to this type of action movie.\nThe title text is a mashup of three of Blume\'s other books: Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great, The Pain and the Great One, and Then Again, Maybe I Won\'t, and likely the inspiration for the dark lines in the comic.\n\nI know you\'re listening" may refer to an earlier xkcd comic, 525: I Know You\'re Listening.\nThe idea of turning an innocent children\'s book into a violent movie was previously touched in 633: Blockbuster Mining.\nAre You There, God? It\'s Me, Margaret was previously referenced in the title text of 1354: Heartbleed Explanation.\n\n
