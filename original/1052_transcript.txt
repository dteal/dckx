n\nRandall has written a song called Every Major\'s Terrible and this comic illustrates the song. In this song the term Major refers to the US version of an academic major. And the point of the song is that it makes no sense to pick any major since they are all terrible!\nThe header notes that the song is written to the tune of the satirical Major-General\'s Song from Gilbert and Sullivan\'s 1879 comic opera The Pirates of Penzance. The song satirizes the idea of the "modern" educated British Army officer of the latter 19th century. Major general is a military rank in Britain and many other countries. (See here a YouTube video of " I Am the Very Model of A Modern Major-General" to get the tune). The meter in the Major-General\'s Song is iambic octameter, which means that in each line there are eight iambs, where an iamb is two syllables in an unstressed-stressed pattern. Therefore, each line contains 16 syllables.\nThe panels show Randall\'s rewritten lyrics to the song. Below each of the three verses are described in detail (go to Verse 1, Verse 2 or Verse 3). Each verse ends with "Just put me down as \'Undecided\' - Every Major\'s Terrible", which gives the song its name \xe2\x80\x94 and "Major\'s Terrible" is similar enough to "Major General", the corresponding lyrics in the original version, to serve as a callback. The last line of the first verse in each song goes as follows:\n\nOriginal: I am the very model of a modern Major-General\nRandall\'s: Just put me down as undecided every major\'s terrible\n\nThe lyrics are commonly rewritten, the most famous rewrite likely being The Elements (song) by Tom Lehrer which is also mentioned below the main header. This song is also available on-line. \nHis last suggestion, "Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious", from Mary Poppins, is another fast-paced patter-song with a somewhat similar tune, though it doesn\'t fit quite so well, and the match falls apart at the end of the fourth line, when the "Um-diddly"s start up \xe2\x80\x94 still, it\'s better than nothing.\nThere are at least two performances of this xkcd song online where the transcription is shown to make it easier to understand the text:\n\nA video with each major acted out by the  SFU Choir - Every Major\'s Terrible.\nA solo with piano: Every Major\'s Terrible\' by Ben Miller.\nSee also this article Xkcd\'s \'Every Major\'s Terrible\' Is Now A Real Song.\n\n\nRegarding the title text: "Undeclared" is sometimes called "General Studies". Most U.S. universities will not let you get a degree in this, let alone an advanced degree such as a Ph.D. Also, it should probably be noted that this song refers to U.S.-like university systems, in other countries, one will study little to nothing outside your major, making it more-or-less impossible to be undecided as to major.\n\n
