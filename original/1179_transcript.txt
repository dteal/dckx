n\nWhen abbreviating the date into numerical form, various areas of the world tend to list the year, month, and day in different orders (as well as with different delimiting symbols), which can cause confusion particularly when the day value is 12 or lower allowing it to be easily interpreted as the month and vice versa. As a public service announcement, this comic states that there is in fact one international standard for writing numeric dates, set by the International Organization for Standardization in its ISO 8601 standard.\nThe comic then proceeds to list several discouraged ways of writing out the date of the comic\'s publication, as they do not match the standard. It begins with several commonly used ones in countries around the world, but then begins to list increasingly uncommon ways, ranging from strange (Roman numerals) to quirky (binary, Unix time) to essentially impossible (painting the numbers onto a black cat).\nThe title text provides a perfect example of the kind of ambiguity that can arise when non-standard formats are used. The ISO standard was in fact published on 1988-06-05 and amended on 2004-12-01. This is mentioned in the title text in mm/dd/yy format; however, there is no way to naturally figure this out, particularly with the second date. With the year truncated to two digits and all three numbers at 12 or lower, the date referring to December 1, 2004 may well be interpreted as 12 January 2004, or as 2012-01-04.\nDate formats was again the subject in 1340: Unique Date.\nThe other mentioned formats are:\n\n\n\n Date \n Explanation\n\n\n 02/27/2013\n\n MM/DD/YYYY, used mostly in the United States.\n\n\n 02/27/13\n\n MM/DD/YY, same as above but with the year shortened to two digits.\n\n\n 27/02/2013\n\n DD/MM/YYYY, used variously in South America, Canada (officially uses ISO 8601), Australia, New Zealand and Europe.\n\n\n 27/02/13\n\n DD/MM/YY, same as above but with the year shortened to two digits.\n\n\n 20130227\n\n YYYYMMDD, same as ISO 8601 without delimiting punctuation. Allowed by the standard. Technically not ambiguous but is hard to read as a date at first glance.\n\n\n 2013.02.27\n\n YYYY.MM.DD, used in Japan. Same as ISO 8601 except with different punctuation.\n\n\n 27.02.13\n\n DD.MM.YY, used in Germany, Russia, etc.\n\n\n 27-02-13\n\n DD-MM-YY, used in Denmark, Netherlands, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, etc.\n\n\n 27.2.13\n\n D.M.YY. It is common in several areas to abbreviate the month or day to a single digit and drop the leading zero when possible.\n\n\n 2013. II. 27.\n\n YYYY. MM. DD., with month as Roman numerals, used in Hungary.\n\n\n 27\xe2\x81\x842-13\n\n D\xe2\x81\x84M-YY, traditional format in Sweden\n\n\n 2013.158904109\n\n Year and decimal fraction of year. 0.158904109 is a decimal approximation of 58/365, with February 27 being the 58th day of the year. Allowed in ISO 8601 as it is not ambiguous; presumably easier to read for computers/programs but difficult for humans.\n\n\n MMXIII-II-XXVII\n\n The ISO 8601 standard but written in Roman numerals. Never used as a traditional standard anywhere as it is hard to read, parse, and interpret for no benefit.\n\n\n MMXIII LVII\xe2\x81\x84CCCLXV\n\n Year followed by its partial fraction 57/365, all in Roman numerals. Equally useless as the above. As a note, apparently this \'standard\' is different from the decimal fraction two rows above, as the decimal fraction notation uses the end of the day (first day of the year is 1/365 while the last is 365/365), while this uses the beginning (first day is 0/365 and last is 364/365).\n\n\n 1330300800\n\n UNIX Timestamp, a standard method of storing absolute time in many computer systems and defined as the number of seconds since 00:00:00 on 1970-01-01 (UTC). The Unix time listed here appears to mistakenly be for 2012-02-27, which is also mentioned by Randall in the original transcript.\n\n\n ((3+3)\xc3\x97(111+1)-1)\xc3\x973/3-1/33\n\n A useless format where the numbers 2013, 2, and 27 written as needlessly long arithmetic expressions using just the digits 1 and 3. For additional confusion, the values are delimited by slashes, enabling confusion with the fraction bar.  (If evaluated literally, the entire expression evaluates to 670.963, or 671 minus 1 divided by 27.)\n\n\n
