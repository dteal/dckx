n\nCueball is making love with Megan but, like many highly introverted people, his attention is split between his inner and outer worlds. Part of his mind is counting her touches, and another part is wondering why his brain does these things, automatically and without his wanting it to. This worries him, and makes him feel guilty because he isn\'t giving her his undivided attention, which he believes she deserves.\nAs he unwillingly counts her touches, he recognized the Fibonacci sequence. This recognition shocks him: it\'s like she knows what is going on in his head, and secretly sent him this signal to tell him that it\'s okay, she understands. Awestruck, he is reassured, and glories in her love.\nThe title text makes this clear, he is able to stop worrying about the counting, and he is able to let it continue just in the background. It doesn\'t stop, but it isn\'t nearly that important or salient as the touching done by Megan.\n\n
