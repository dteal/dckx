n\nIn movie theaters in the US, seats are not reserved. That is, tickets are sold by screening without seat assignment, and therefore an entering patron can take any vacant seat. Therefore, a group of incoming patrons may walk in a column and take a section of consecutive seats in a row, each person taking one next to the person in front of them. The order of these people is thus determined by the order in which they walk into the theater, which is in most cases random.\nCueball is upset at the way he and his friends have sat down at the movie theater. Part of the problem is that two people who are apparently in a relationship do not sit together. He therefore tries to use a social graph to calculate the best way for him and his seven friends to sit in a row, while taking into account all of the social connections among them. In mathematics, this type of problem is called combinatorial optimisation. The most popular example, the travelling salesman problem, is referenced in the title text, as well as in comics 287 and 399.\nThe title text shows that another part of the problem is that Cueball\'s friends who could have helped him calculate a solution are each sitting three seats away from him, and so he cannot ask them for help.\n\n
