n\nThis comic is about the fact that much of the way we see the world is subjective. From space the directions up and down appear subjective, as gravity can not be strongly felt. Also since the vestibular system (the balance glands in the ear) does not strongly impact equilibrioception (the sense of balance) and the sense of balances is often based on vision, which uses subjective clues to determine what is the up and down, up and down can seem arbitrary at times. For example, people can convince them selves (accidentally or deliberately) that up is down and down is up or be confused about their orientation (dizzy). Forcing yourself to think in a different perspective changes a lot of things that are usually thought of as mundanities.\nBeret Guy convinces himself that down is toward the sky. Megan witnesses and asks him why he is clinging to the ground. He responds that he is holding on to the ground so that he does not fall into the sky. Megan at first dismisses this but later looks up, gets scared and is found by Ponytail, clinging to a mailbox afraid of falling up.\nThe title text continues this idea, where  Megan "drops" a bird into the sky, and never hears it hit the "bottom". As birds can fly, and captured birds often fly away when released, its flight appeared to Megan as the bird falling upward. "didn\'t hear it hit bottom" would normally mean that, after you throw a rock into a pit, it takes too long to hit bottom, or the sound couldn\'t even make it to the thrower.\n\n
