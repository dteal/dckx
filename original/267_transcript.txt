n\nThis is the existentialistic climax of the Choices series. It takes up the recurring xkcd-theme how people tend to be blind towards the staggering amount of possibilities that each day holds, with routine and boredom as a result. (See e.g. 137: Dreams and 706: Freedom.)\nThe Megan-clone implies that Megan has been taken to some kind of afterlife or parallel universe outside reality. Its not a dream, but she will not remember this place when she goes back. But the clone hopes that these hints will stay with her. Realizing that she would not remember being here, Megan suddenly realizes that she might already have been here before. And the clone admits that she has taken her to this place once before. Although not for another hint though; actually it was to make out with herself. And then she quickly says bye.\nThe title text makes it clear that the Megan-clone did actually earlier brought her into this place just to make out, and then refers to this being the second time this has been a theme, 105: Parallel Universe being the first.Randall appears to find a little troubling (or it may be that he suspects his readers will).\nThe series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday).
