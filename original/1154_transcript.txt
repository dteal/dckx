n\nThis New Year comic is a little reminder that it\'s the last day of 2012, and it\'s time to make your New Year\'s resolutions!\nCueball wants to break a very common habit of resolving to do something (go on a diet, for example), not doing it, and then trying the same, dysfunctional plan again, thinking it will work "this year." This is another way of stating a common folk definition of insanity: to keep doing what you always do yet expecting different results.\nThe irony is that Cueball resolved the same thing last year, and it is implied it didn\'t work, but he says it\'ll be different "this year."\nThe title text is a parody of the saying "if at first you don\'t succeed: try, try, try again."\n\n
