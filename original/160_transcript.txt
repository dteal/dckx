n\nPenny Arcade is a webcomic, primarily about video-games and the culture surrounding them. It is written by Jerry Holkins and illustrated by Mike Krahulik, though they are better known as their comic alter-egos: Tycho Brahe and Jonathan "Gabe" Gabriel.\nThis strip begins as a parody of the Penny Arcade strip which makes fun of Sony for providing a lack-luster selection of PS3 games available on the console\'s launch date. However, it quickly turns into the narrator\'s fantasy of what might happen if Tycho discovered his spoof.\nThe enormous wall of text in the second and third panels may be a reference to the Penny Arcade strip "I Hope You Like Text".\nThe cardboard tube references one of Gabe\'s alternate characters, Cardboard Tube Samurai.\n\n
