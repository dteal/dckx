n\nA science fair involves schoolchildren doing research on a subject of their choice. The purpose is to give them hands-on experience with scientific techniques. Even so, a project based on cunnilingus, oral stimulation of the female genitalia, would not likely be acceptable in a science fair, a setting that is not only public but also involving children. However adolescents are often very curious about sex and can often misjudge what is appropriate behaviour.\nEspecially cute are the notations for a function, its Fourier transform, and its Laplace transform. The section titled "Challenges in frequency domain analysis" show four graphs which may be representative of amplitude modulation (variation in the depth of licking), frequency modulation (variation of the rate of licking), a small high frequency signal superimposed on a larger, slower one, and a periodic but non-continuous signal. These would have more complex Fourier and Laplace transforms than a simple sinusoidal licking function.  \nThe title text is probably a reference to An Inconvenient Truth, a 94-minute documentary film where former US vice president Al Gore teaches the general public about the dangers of global warming. It has been included in science curricula in schools around the world, to the ire of easily bored students everywhere.\nThis comic was mentioned in FRUIT OPINIONS! on the Blag. Although this comic must have been one of the more controversial, it had nothing on the impact of 388: Fuck Grapefruit which was the cause of the Blag entry as it became the most controversial comic written to that point (i.e. 2008): ...beating out comics about cunnilingus, the Obama endorsement, and my making 4chan tiny on the map of the internet. (See the grapefruit comic for more details).\n\n
