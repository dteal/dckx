n\nThe game of go (also called Weiqi, Baduk or Igo) is usually played on the 19\xc3\x9719 intersections of a grid, but sometimes a faster, simpler version is played on the 9\xc3\x979 intersections of a grid; which thus has 8\xc3\x978 squares, as a chessboard, though they are not colored in an alternating pattern \xe2\x80\x93 introduced to chess in the 13th century. In the comic, white has chess pieces and plays against black, which uses go stones.\nIn chess, particularly in puzzles, the phrasing "White to move" indicates that it\'s the White player\'s turn; "White to play and win" indicates that it\'s White\'s turn and if White plays correctly, the next series of moves will result in an advantageous position or possibly outright win for White. The caption "White to continue insisting this is a chessboard" is a play on this traditional phrasing. The same kind of phrasing is also used in Go puzzles. In Go puzzles the objectives are often of a local or tactical character, such as "White to capture four black stones" or "White to live in the corner".\nTwo versions of the board were posted by Randall: both had white after e3, d4, Nf3, Nc3, but the first with an extra bishop at e4 ([email&#160;protected]/*  */), the second after Bd2.\n[email&#160;protected]/*  */ in the first version of the board was perhaps intended to represent confusion in White\'s mind whether he was playing Go (placing a piece) or Chess (it\'s a chess piece) \xe2\x80\x93 as a \'placement\' this move could have been first, and could explain the pawn at e3, with e4 already being blocked. Like 1230: Polar/Cartesian, this comic thrives on ambiguity; the two boards appear similar but are incompatible in practice, but either side could be seen as right.\nIt is unclear who has gone first. In Go it is traditional for black to go first, while in Chess it has been traditional for white to go first for about a century. Indeed, both players have made five moves, although the caption/"punchline" implies it is the start of white\'s sixth turn; though if black did go first, none of his/her pieces are in the 3-3 handicap positions marked on a 9\xc3\x979 Go board.\nThe title text refers to the upcoming 2013 World Chess Championship between Carlsen and Anand. Magnus Carlsen is a 22 year old Norwegian chess grandmaster, who had the highest peak rating and was the third youngest grandmaster in history. He was the world\'s 2009 blitz champion and is currently ranked #1 in the world by FIDE. Viswanathan Anand is a 43 year old Indian grandmaster, 5 time and current World Champion, who is currently ranked #8 in the world.\nThe game transcript in the title text refers to the ending of the famous Opera Game between Paul Morphy and the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard. That game ends with 16. Qb8+ Nxb8 17. Rd8#. In the title text, Black continues to make moves as if he has not been checkmated, over White\'s protests. After White uses his rook to capture Black\'s king to emphasize the checkmate, Black defiantly writes "0-1" (the notation symbolizing a Black victory) on his scoresheet. When informed that his move cannot be to declare victory, he flips the board. "0-1" may also represent a position on a go board (first down on the top left corner) in certain coordinates systems.\nThe game transcript is written in standard algebraic notation. The destination square is represented by a lowercase letter (a-h, on the x-axis) and a number (1-8, on the y-axis), with the bottom-left square being a1 and the top-right square being h8. The uppercase letters refer to the piece that is moving to that square (e.g., Q = Queen, K = King, N = Knight, R = Rook), so Qa1 would mean moving the Queen to the bottom-left square. The absence of an uppercase letter refers to a pawn\'s move (e.g., "f6" means moving a pawn to f6). If the move captures a piece, an "x" is inserted between the piece and the destination (e.g., Nxb8). Checks are indicated by +, and checkmate by #.\n\n
