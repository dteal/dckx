n\nA basilisk is a legendary creature reputed to have the power to kill with a single glance. In this comic, Cueball learns much to his dismay that the basilisk\'s power is fully compatible with the 21st century, and can kill you just with a smiley emoticon over instant messaging.\nCueball\'s request for A/S/L is a standard question when first meeting someone online; it asks for age, sex (gender) and location.\nThe title text mentions U+FDD0, which in reality is the code for a "non-character" in Unicode.\n\nU+FDD0 did in fact kill at least one chat client at the time. Konversation in particular. (and presumably any other Qt-based chat clients using QTextDocument)\n"basically u+fdd0 (eye of basilisk, the snake) is in a char range that\'s marked for interchange and illegal in utf-8"\n"but qt\'s utf-8 encoder let it through anyway"\n"but it just so happens that qt\'s qtextdocument uses u+fdd0 as text frame delimiter"\n"so when you append it to a qtd, counters run wrong and eventually you crash"\n"d-bus closes the connection and crashes the client when it encounters illegal utf-8, and kde\'s notification system works through d-bus"\nThe problem was fixed after the xkcd "report" and Konversation now handles unicode normally.\n\n
