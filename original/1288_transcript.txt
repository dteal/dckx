n\nThere are now two sequels: 1625: Substitutions 2, and 1679: Substitutions 3. But there have been several comics using substitutions both before and after these ones.\nRandall is playing off of the fact that many readers of modern news articles quickly become bored with the legal and political jargon. He suggests that by substituting certain words for others can make reading the article more interesting, albeit less accurate. Although since Randall doesn\'t think very  highly of the news, he\'s probably suggesting this chart wouldn\'t make them less accurate at all. (See for instance 558: 1000 Times and 932: CIA).\nFor example, a sentence that reads\n\nWitnesses reported that the suspect allegedly escaped unharmed.\n\nwould be changed to\n\nThese dudes I know reported that the suspect kinda probably escaped unharmed.\n\nThis substitution does not change the meaning much, and the original sentence does not lose much of its accuracy. However, for substitutions later in the comic, a sentence may be changed as following\n\nA new study finds that senators and other congressional leaders are increasingly likely to view election results on their smartphone.\n\ninto\n\nA Tumblr post finds that elf-lords and other river spirits are increasingly likely to view eating contest results on their Pok\xc3\xa9dex.\n\nWhich is less meaningful, but more interesting.\nThe final substitution returns from the realm of the ridiculous to replacing "could not be reached for comment" with "is guilty and everyone knows it." If a journalist writes a story about an accused suspect but is unable to contact them or receives no response from them, they will write that the person "could not be reached for comment." Randall\'s whimsical assumption that silence implies guilt is so common that juries are instructed that they should not infer guilt if the defendant fails to testify, particularly in nations which have a right against self-incrimination.\nChrome and Firefox extensions are available for applying the substitutions on webpages.\n\'Spaaace\' could be a reference to the Space Core from Portal 2, or to the way The Muppet Show presented Pigs in Spaaace.\nThe Virtual Boy is a table-top video game console made by Nintendo released in 1995, and discontinued about the same year. It achieved true-3D graphics through the use of a large visor containing a pair of LED screens.\nThe Pok\xc3\xa9dex is a device in the Pok\xc3\xa9mon world that records the data of captured Pok\xc3\xa9mon.\nHomestar Runner is the title character of a Flash-animated web cartoon series, known for being an idiot.\nIt seems generally that Randall is no fan of Google Glass, which was also shown earlier in 1251: Anti-Glass and later in 1304: Glass Trolling. Thus explaining why Google Glass has such a ridiculous substitution as Virtual Boy. Google Glass has become a recurring theme in xkcd.\nIn the title text Elon Musk is mentioned. He is (amongst other things) the CEO of Tesla Motors, which produces electric cars. In the title text the sentence "Electric cars" was replaced by "atomic cats" according to the chart of the comic.\nNews reports about new studies (Tumblr posts) are further lampooned in 1295: New Study, a comic posted two weeks later.\n\n
