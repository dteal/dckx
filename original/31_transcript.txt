n\nThis gives a happy ending to the Barrel series. The flying ferret is from 20: Ferret. The humor is derived from the juxtaposition of two unlike elements - in this case, the contemplative and even dark nature of the Barrel series being resolved through the timely intervention of a comical flying mammal.\nThe series is probably inspired by the novella The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup\xc3\xa9ry. Randall is well known to be a fan of this book.\nSomewhere between the release of the first ferret comic in October 2005 and the re-release of that comic (and all the other from LiveJournal in 2005) on New Year\'s Day 2006 on the new xkcd site, Randall\'s brothers ferret died - as given by the new RIP comment in the title text. The sad comment in the title text of 25: Barrel - Part 4 ":(" implying harm to the boy along with this RIP comment may imply that the boy has died and joined the ferret (in flying to Heaven). However, this line of reasoning only makes sense if the ferret actually died before the release of the Part 4 comic at the end of October and this comic which were released in the middle of November 2005, 1\xc2\xbd month before the new title text were made public.\nThis is the last in a six-part series of comics whose parts were randomly published during the first several dozen strips. The series features a character that is not consistent with what would quickly become the xkcd stick figure style. The character was in a barrel in part 1-3.\nAfter Randall released the full The Boy and his Barrel story on xkcd it has been clear that the original Ferret story should also be included as part of the barrel series.\nThe full series can be found here. But below they are listed in the order Randall has put them in his collection linked to above:\n\n 1: Barrel - Part 1\n 20: Ferret\n 11: Barrel - Part 2\n 22: Barrel - Part 3\n 25: Barrel - Part 4\n 31: Barrel - Part 5\n\n
