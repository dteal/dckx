n\nThe song on the radio is "Welcome to My Life" by Simple Plan (not A Simple Plan), which was released in 2004 as a first single to the band\'s second album "Still Not Getting Any..." The lyrics of the song mainly deal with the frustration of adolescence and the stress of newfound independence. Many, if not all, adolescents go through a phase where the ongoing realization of becoming fully responsible for their body, mind and personality beyond their parents frightens them.\nWhat is ironic about Simple Plan\'s lyrics is that the members of the band are all in their 30s. The absurdity of middle-aged men complaining about teen angst could be interpreted as a spoof or parody, which Cueball mistakenly believes as the truth. In the comic, Cueball comes to the horrifying realization that the members of the band are indeed seriously whining about the typical shallow musings of a spoiled teenager, not parodying them.\nThe title text reaffirms the comic by describing how the lyrics do not make any sense, and are not actually written by teenagers.\n\n
