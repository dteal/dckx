n\nThis is the second in the "My Hobby" series of xkcd comics.\nThis comic humorously compares the rules of light gun cabinet arcade video games with real life.\nRandall suggests that his hobby is going to drug busts with the expressed purpose of getting shot as an innocent bystander, thereby causing the police to lose 100 points.\nDrug busts are events where police attempt to catch drug dealers, suppliers, and financiers in situations with enough evidence to convict them. In the style of arcade video games being examined, drug busts are usually depicted as chaotic events with villains, innocent bystanders, captives, and allies popping up like spring loaded targets at a shooting range in a setting with lots of places to hide.  If you don\'t shoot a hostile target sufficiently quick, you will be shot, so it is common to shoot the wrong targets. To add extra challenge these games often deduct points \xe2\x80\x94 or worse, cause damage to the player character \xe2\x80\x94 if the player shoots the wrong target. This is often frustrating; not only does the player feel they have failed to judge their target properly, but the wasted time can cause them to get shot by the real targets. \nObviously, doing this in real life would be a really bad idea, as the hobbyist would quickly be killed.\nThe title text refers to the game "Area 51" which was a popular shooter arcade game from 1995 (although a console/PC game of the same name was released in 2005). Area 51 was one of many cabinet arcade games which featured a light gun that allowed players to aim at the screen and shoot in a realistic control mechanic. The title text confirms that the comic is referring to these light gun cabinet games specifically.\nThe title text of 188: Reload references this strip.\n\n
