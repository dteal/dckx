n\nThis comic addresses the issue of commitment-phobic partners who get into relationships but get cold feet when it starts to get serious. The girl wants someone who can see every part of who she is, and still love her.\nIn the title text Randall mentions that he is a big fan of Kurt Halsey, a comic artist from Oregon. He was also referenced in 24: Godel, Escher, Kurt Halsey. His style is similar to that in this comic. Many of his comics and paintings depict a couple and convey various emotions they go through as does this comic. \nIn the original Randall quote (see trivia) he gives the above link to the official home page of Kurt Halsey. And then he mentions that if you had not realized he was a big fan already you should reconsider clicking on the link because it\'s depressing how much better at this he is than me.\n\n
