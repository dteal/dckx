n\nThis is a simple scatterplot showing how often the word "sustainable" has been used in English texts in the US each year. As can be seen, the y-axis is given a logarithmic scale, meaning that the apparently linear trend is actually exponential. Randall humorously attempts to extend the graph to the point the frequency exceeds 100% about a century from now, which obviously makes no sense (hence the quip that the word\'s usage is itself "unsustainable").\nThe use of the word "sustainable" has been increasing as people become more aware of the steadily increasing use of nonrenewable resources and need to ensure that the Earth\'s resources do not become totally exhausted, through sustainable development. Sustainable development refers to the practice of using resources that simultaneously aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present time, but also for generations to come.\nAs Randall somewhat depressingly mentions in the title text, the ~100 years that it will supposedly take for the word "sustainable" to become unsustainable is actually a lot longer than most of our nonrenewable resources will last on the Earth. The idea that all of the Earth\'s coal, oil, natural gas, etc. that has built up over the past millions of years may be completely gone within the century is unsettling.\nMore realistically, the actual use of "sustainable" is likely to be logistic rather than exponential growth. A logistic curve describes a trend that at first behaves exponentially, but then tapers off and reaches a cap. This is demonstrated by the Google ngrams graph of word usage for "sustainable". Logistic growth is commonly used to model data that naturally increases exponentially but has a limiting factor, such as population growth.\nExtrapolation of data has also appeared in the following comics 605: Extrapolating, 1204: Detail and 1281: Minifigs.\n\n
