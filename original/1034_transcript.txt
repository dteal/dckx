n\nThis comic is a commentary on what sort of articles work best on different social networking services. From left to right the share buttons are: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google+.\n\nTwitterers are often stereotyped as constantly trying to be funny; hence, the article on stand-up comedy is shared most on Twitter.\n\nConspiracy theory articles play well on Reddit, especially if they are against the Christian Right and for Wikipedia, as there is a loud and large atheist community on Reddit.\n\n"Boycott Facebook" articles are ironically popular on Facebook. Google+, being semantically akin to Facebook, also has a significant anti-Facebook community. One of the punchlines is that Google+ is struggling and not used much.\n\nThe last article gets almost no shares at all \xe2\x80\x94 not many want to admit they are reading an article about a RealDoll, a type of sex doll. (Also mentioned in Game AIs and Flying Cars.) A Custom ROM is an aftermarket distribution of the Android operating system and are often targeted toward enthusiasts. This community exists primarily on Google+ (as Google is the main developer of Android), and is one of the few active communities on that social network. As Android is an operating system primarily aimed at smartphones and tablet computers, installing it on a RealDoll, whilst possible due to Android\'s open source nature, would be a very niche activity, and the low number of shares indicates that it only interests a small portion of the already-small (relative to other social networks) Google+ community.\n\nThe title text humorously combines appealing subjects for all four networks:\n\na hilarious joke \xe2\x80\x93 Twitter, same as above.\nabout Mark Zuckerberg \xe2\x80\x93 founder of Facebook.\nusing a pseudonym \xe2\x80\x93 referencing a controversy about real names on Google+.\nto sneak past the TSA \xe2\x80\x93 Reddit, a conspiracy theory as above.\n\n
