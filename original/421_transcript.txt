n\nCueball is attempting to make hash browns. A hash brown is a way of serving a potato where the potato has been diced or shredded in some way, then pan-fried. Cueball\'s method for making hash browns, though, is rather unique. He is throwing potatoes into the air and striking them with a flaming tennis racket at his friend, who is holding a tray with a dangerously tilting half filled glass balanced on top. He (the friend)is also holding a fork in the other hand. \nThe idea is that the tennis racket would simultaneously dice the potato, fry it, and then launch the completed product towards his friend\'s plate. In reality, this probably wouldn\'t do much. To properly pan-fry food, it must be cooked in a pan with some oil to lubricate the food, with enough time for the heat to transfer through the oil and spread properly through the food. Hitting a potato with a flaming tennis racket would not cook it as it would strike it too quickly, and it probably wouldn\'t dice it either unless the wire of the racket is incredibly sharp. Cueball would probably just end up batting a not even hot, uncooked, unprepared potato at his friend, while simultaneously burning his own hand.\nThe title text comments on how many ways this experiment could go badly (14), and jokes that there are even more potential problems (17) if the fork Cueball\'s friend is holding is a cross-breed (see 419: Forks and Spoons which was published only four days earlier. By reading this comic it should be clear what could go wrong if they were included in the equation - 3 more ways would be a low estimate...)\nIt\'s unclear what Randall may or may not have had on his mind with regards to specific ways the situation in the comic could go wrong. But here are 14 potential ways the activity could go wrong without including Sporks:\n\nCueball could burn himself with the flaming tennis racket.\nThe can of gasoline could leak and then Cueball could drop the racket, causing a fire to spread.\nCueball may fail to hit the potato and it would get dirty from the ground.\nCueball may fail to hit the potato and whack himself with the aforementioned flaming tennis racket.\nCueball may hit the potato and knock the plate out of his friend\'s hand, smashing it.\nCueball may hit the potato and knock the glass out of his friend\'s hand, smashing that instead.\nBoth of the above could happen.\nCueball might instead hit the potato at his friend\'s head.\nCueball could accidentally launch the tennis racket itself (if he has exceptionally poor grip,) at his friend.\nCueball could drop the tennis racket onto the can of gasoline, causing it to explode.\nEven if none of the above happened, Cueball would fail to actually cook the potato,\nLikewise, Cueball would probably not succeed in dicing the potato.\nAnd he could miss hitting his friends plate.\nA velociraptor could appear out of nowhere and eat the potato, then proceed to devour Cueball and his friend. (A possibility which likely plagues Randall\'s mind daily.)\n\n
