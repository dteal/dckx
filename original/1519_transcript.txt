n\nMiss Lenhart is teaching a class on science about the planet Venus.\nIn the first panel we see her teaching the history of Venus. Venus may have had water on its surface billions years ago, but if that\'s true all hydrogen since then was eventually lost due to dissociation. However, there is no evidence that Venus ever had fields of flowers, or Venusians, or any other form of life.\nThe runaway greenhouse effect on the second panel is a play on words. Miss Lenhart uses the term literally and claims the existence of sentient greenhouses that actually ran away. In reality, the effect caused Venus to develop a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, which raised its temperature above to approx. 460&#160;\xc2\xb0C (860&#160;\xc2\xb0F), hotter than daytime on Mercury. This eventually destroyed all evidence of anything that had been on the surface of Venus billions of years ago.\nThe third panel ties the previous distortion of Miss Lenhart into the very real historic reputation of the Netherlands as flower growers and as a further fabrication by Miss Lenhart the Dutch flower industry was in fact started by the Venusians.\nIn the final panel we learn that she is a month away from retirement and doesn\'t care about relaying accurate information anymore. She just wants to have a laugh at the expense of the naive school children. Although it is clear that Science Girl in the front row was not fooled.\nThe title text jokes about the butterfly effect, the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings in Japan can cause a Tornado in the U.S.. In this case the butterflies would just help pollinate the flowers. The butterfly effect is a term coined by Edward Norton Lorenz who had the comic 1350: Lorenz named after him due to its chaotic nature.\nAlthough Miss Lenhart was supposed to retire a month after this comic she seems to return a year later for a math course at university level, in 1724: Proofs, where she continues the trend from this class.\n\n
