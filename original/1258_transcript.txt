n\nCueball is commenting on the urge some people have to be the first to make a comment on any given posting, be it a blog post or a YouTube video or some other commentable content, and to obnoxiously point out that they have made the first comment. This often manifests as the poster simply posting the word "First" without contributing any actual content to the discussion.\nIn the first two panels, Cueball stares at his screen, implying that a long time passes before he finally points this out. He has probably submitted a post and is awaiting for comments that are not coming. Cueball might actually have mixed feelings about the practice slowly dying out. However, someone offscreen is worried he will jinx it, encouraging more people to do so. See also 269: TCMP and 1019: First Post.\nThe title text sarcastically states that no new annoying internet behaviors have emerged since the "first post" trend began which would continue to annoy users: a fact which is clearly wrong to anyone who spends a length of time on the internet. See for instance 493: Actuarial.\n\n
