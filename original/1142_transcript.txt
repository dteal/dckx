n\nA Faraday cage is a cage of conducting material that interferes and blocks out electromagnetic radiation like cell phone signals, provided the material is of the appropriate thickness and the gaps between the "bars" are significantly smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. A cage match is a type of wrestling match in which the participants fight in a ring enclosed by a metal cage. The comic caption is a play on the two terms, putting Cueball into a cage match in the Faraday cage that is blocking his reception.\nThe caption "faraday cagematch" is a portmanteau of "faraday cage" and "cagematch".\nThe title text is a play on a rule in cage matches that states that a participant wins if they are first to escape the cage. Tunneling diodes are capable of fast operation, allowing a device to generate high frequency signals, which are more capable of penetrating the mesh openings in a Faraday cage.\n\n
