n\nAction movies, such as "Kill Bill" by Quentin Tarantino, often feature elaborate fight scenes in mundane environments. \nCueball, here wearing earphones connected to his iPod, is often imagining himself in such a situation, for instance as in this comic, while at the post office. This makes the comic related to the My Hobby series.\nFirst Cueball imagines the old man (an old version of White Hat with a cane) pulls out a crossbow and how he would react to that. But then continues to imagine that Hairbun has a katana samurai sword in the box. So this could be a long fight so he decides to be ready for it by setting his iPod to play the "Kill Bill" fight theme. In Kill Bill there is a long fight scene with samurai swords.\nThe title text refers to two songs: "Battle Without Honor or Humanity" from the soundtrack of "Kill Bill", and "Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner, the latter being associated to fighting scenes because of a famous sequence in the movie "Apocalypse Now" by Francis Ford Coppola. He notes that these two songs will absolutely improve any activity. Not only fight scenes.\n\n
