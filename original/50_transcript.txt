n\nPenny Arcade is a popular web comic that focuses on the video game culture. The character above is Tycho Brahe, one of the two main characters of Penny Arcade (the other being Jonathan "Gabe" Gabriel). Penny Arcade has a reputation for making obscure references to video games without explaining, expecting the reader to be as well-versed in gaming culture as they are.  Hence, the attitude shown in this comic.\n\'Seiken Densetsu\' as mentioned in the strip probably refers to Seiken Densetsu 3, an Action role-playing game (Action-RPG) released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in Japan in 1995. The game was never released in the North American region or officially translated to English. However, many North American game players may recognize Seiken Densetsu 2, the predecessor in the series, by its North American name: Secret of Mana.\nAs the title text admits, they know they behave like this, and have this reputation, but they don\'t care, and even refer to it in their own comic.\n\n
