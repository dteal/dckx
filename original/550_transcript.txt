n\nFirst up, we have a sex scene where Cueball is together with Megan who doesn\'t wish to become pregnant. Unfortunately for both of them, Cueball ends up ejaculating prematurely before "pulling out"... \nRather than apologize or try and salvage the relationship, Cueball responds in perhaps the most absurd possible way and invokes five then-popular Internet meme in one sentence:\n\n Sup dawg, I herd you didn\'t liek forming babby, but I accidentally in your base.\n\nThe sentence can be translated into:\n\n Whats up girl, I heard that you don\'t want to get pregnant but I accidentally came inside you.\n\nBelow the frame the pros and cons of uttering such a sentence is listed. \n\nCons: Cueball\'s life is now thoroughly "ruined" as he now may become a father with a girl who did not wish a baby. Also the incident with the memes would likely put a damper on his relationship with Megan even if she did not get pregnant.\nPros: The sentence set the new density record for memes (most memes referenced in fewest words). This explains the title of the comic. But it will be a very superficial and respectless world record to hold when the return is a ruined life.\n\nThe five memes used are:\n\nYo Dawg\nThis can also be used with Sup Dawg as in this comic.\n\nI herd u liek Mudkips\nMudkip is a Pok\xc3\xa9mon, but here it is about not liking the next memes text.\n\nHow is babby formed?\nFull question in Yahoo Answers was "how is babby formed / how girl get pragnent".\nThis was already referenced in the title text of 481: Listen to Yourself and in 522: Google Trends.\n\nI Accidentally. \nIn this meme the verb is omitted. \nIn this case the omitted verb is came or ejaculated.\nReferenced again in 997: Wait Wait.\n\nin ur base.\nThis is extra funny in the relation to what base your date went, (see 540: Base System).\n\n\nThe title text references 4chan, a site known for its memes, trolls and other assorted internet clutter, and sarcastically implies that any advice they might give would in any way be at all helpful. Due to its population of trolls and other unhelpful sorts, advice given by 4chan would normally be useless at best and actively detrimental at worst; however, the title text implies that Cueball regrets that he did not ask 4chan for advice, and maybe have used them for this earlier. Maybe to ask How is babby formed...\n\n
