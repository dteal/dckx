n\nCueball and Megan are sitting on a hospital bed, reading a piece of paper with the statistics for breast cancer survival. It looks like Megan has just been diagnosed with breast cancer. The thick line represents the survival rate distribution (probability to be alive after X years, unconditioned): 81% are alive at 5 years, while 77% survive to 10 years. The dashed line represents the hazard function (the negative derivative of the thick line divided by the value of the thick line at each point, i.e. how fast the thick line falls with respect to the current value, or the risk of failing/dying at time t+\xce\x94t after having survived until time t as \xce\x94t approaches zero), which is the rate between the density of the failure distribution and the survival function.\nRandall wrote this comic after his fiancee was diagnosed with breast cancer. Two months after posting this strip, he posted this blog post explaining the cancer comics.\nThe title text is a reference to 55: Useless, where his normal approach also fails him regarding love. Cueball\'s (and Randall\'s) normal approach \xe2\x80\x94 math \xe2\x80\x94 isn\'t much help in dealing with these  types of emotional situations. \n\n
