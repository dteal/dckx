n\nSome websites, not long after the page finishes loading, suddenly play a song. It\'s annoying to the person visiting the site and to others that are nearby, so it will attract a lot of unwanted attention, especially if the song is played at a loud volume. Compounding this would be the possible inappropriateness of the song that is suddenly playing.\nThe five seconds to stop the music (finding the "pause"/"stop" button, muting the computer audio...) is too long in such an incident.\nSince MySpace allows wide customization for members pages, many users have embedded music players which auto-run when the page is visited.\nThe title text refers to the fact that old pages, back in the late 1990s, used embedded MIDI files. MIDI files may have terrible sound quality (while lossless, it is limited in the amount of sounds that can be reproduced), but, more importantly, MIDI files that are embedded in the page would not only play automatically, but also have no way to stop playing. The viewer would have to leave the website or externally mute the audio.\n\n
