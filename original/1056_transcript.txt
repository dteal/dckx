n\nThis comic shows a graph with three parts.\nFirst, the names are sorted up by genera (plural of genus, a low-level taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms) from bottom to top of which animals would win in a fight. Secondly, the names within the genus are then sorted by coolness of name from left to right (the degree of "coolness" of the name is apparently determined in subjective manner by the author). Thirdly, in red you can see the direction that Apple has taken with nicknaming the versions of their OS X operating system. They started at v10.0 "Cheetah", and have moved through genera from there in no order that this chart can make out.\n\n\n\nOS X version\n\nCode name\n\nYear released\n\n\n10.0\nCheetah\n2001\n\n\n10.1\nPuma\n2001\n\n\n10.2\nJaguar\n2002\n\n\n10.3\nPanther\n2003\n\n\n10.4\nTiger\n2004\n\n\n10.5\nLeopard\n2006\n\n\n10.6\nSnow Leopard\n2008\n\n\n10.7\nLion\n2010\n\n\n10.8\nMountain Lion\n2012\n\nPlease note that the second words in "Snow Leopard" and "Mountain Lion" are capitalized in the table because they are used as the proper names of the operating system versions. In their normal use, as species vernacular names, they are not capitalized and are written as "snow leopard" and "mountain lion".\nBobcats are a running XKCD joke, so their inclusion is to be expected. The genus Puma here only lists synonyms for the puma (see cougar) instead of the actual genus. Of course, the three OS X versions named by three of these synonyms are not the same.\nSince this comic was published, Apple has stopped naming versions of OS X after big cats. Now, Apple names their OSX versions after Californian landmarks. OSX v10.8 "Mountain Lion" was followed by v10.9 "Mavericks", named after a beach in California, followed by v10.10 "Yosemite", named after the California national park, and v10.11 "El Capitan", named after the rock formation in Yosemite National Park.\nThe title of the chart depicted on the comic ("OS X problem") is perhaps an allusion to the travelling salesman problem, as the directed arrows and graph nodes might appear as a possible path of the salesperson between the cities. The computational difficulty of the travelling salesman problem might echo with the difficulties that the author has with trying to figure out the underlying reason for naming the OS X versions in particular order. The chart thus looks like a parody on the scientific presentation.\nIn the title text, despite being named after "Hogwarts", the magical school from the Harry Potter series of books and movies, Dracorex hogwartsia is real. On the other hand, all of the contestants listed for the Most Badass Latin Name competition have problematic credentials: Smilodon combines two Greek roots for carving knife and tooth, Tyrannosaurus combines two Greek roots for king and lizard, Stygimoloch combines a Greek root with a Semitic root, and Dracorex contains two English roots and a Greek.\n\n
