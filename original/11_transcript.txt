n\nLike in the previous comic in the Barrel series, the boy is floating in the ocean in a barrel. The previous comic made a point about the uncertainty of life; here, the boy\'s lament at not finding a mother is pure sentimentality, as accentuated by the title text.\nAccording the Freud, the first stage of psychosexual development is the Oral Stage which relates to a baby\'s relationship with its mother.  The realisation that mommy cannot be found is the first point at which a person learns to stop trusting the world&#91;citation needed&#93; and realises that the world is not always comforting and safe.\nThis is the second in a six-part series of comics whose parts were randomly published during the first several dozen strips. The series features a character that is not consistent with what would quickly become the xkcd stick figure style. The character is in a barrel.\nAfter Randall released the full The Boy and his Barrel story on xkcd it has been clear that the original Ferret story should also be included as part of the barrel series.\nThe full series can be found here. But below they are listed in the order Randall has put them in his collection linked to above:\n\n 1: Barrel - Part 1\n 20: Ferret\n 11: Barrel - Part 2\n 22: Barrel - Part 3\n 25: Barrel - Part 4\n 31: Barrel - Part 5\n\n
