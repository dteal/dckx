n\nCadbury Eggs are a chocolate egg-shaped candy with a filling. They are supposed to replicate a real egg with a hard exterior and soft interior. However, unlike real eggs, the exterior is edible.\nIn this comic, Cueball is trying to say that sodas have way too much sugar to even be appealing as beverages, because they contain as much sugar as 2 or 3 Cadbury Eggs, and one Cadbury Egg alone makes him feel sick.\nHowever, Megan interprets this in precisely the opposite way to what Cueball intended. Instead of comparing soda to Cadbury Eggs, she compares Cadbury Eggs to soda. If a few Cadbury Eggs have the same amount of sugar as soda, Megan can eat as many as she wants year-round in place of soda, with no additional guilt. Cadbury Eggs are usually consumed around Easter \xe2\x80\x94 which is usually anywhere from late March to late April.\nThe title text mentions the closure of the manufacture in New Zealand in 2009 and the change of the filling from runny to thick as a consequence. The joke here is the comparison to real eggs, who can be cooked scrambled, the new thick filling is not liquid enough to be cooked in a pan, as was the old runny filling.\n\n
