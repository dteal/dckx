n\nThe comic refers to the phenomenon of hearing half a conversation from a stranger on a cell phone and, not noticing the cell phone, imagining that that person is talking to you and responding in kind. The chart gives a plot of the frequency that this occurs (for Randall here represented by the Cueball to the left) against the amount of time that passes before the error is discovered. It also implies that the author\'s second relationship was in reality just a particularly long instance of this occurrence, suggesting that his \'girlfriend\' wasn\'t even aware of the relationship.\nThe title text is the continuation of the phone call, which involves a fictional conspiracy involving the then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, and a crossbow.\n\n
