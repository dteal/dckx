n\nThis comic is a play on the well known Good Cop/Bad Cop police interrogation strategy and the artistic movement Dadaism. \nDadaism is an artistic movement which by its definition is irrational. The movement embraces the free flow of unreasoned thought and prizes nonsense and rejection of established norms. As such, the entire concept of "Good Cop, Dadaist Cop" could be considered a dadaist concept in itself.\n"Good Cop/Bad Cop" is a psychological tactic that may be employed during joint questioning or interrogation. The interrogators isolate the suspect, one of the interrogators acts unreasonable and untrustworthy (bad cop) and the other reasonable and trustworthy in comparison (good cop).  If successful, it deceives the suspect into believing they must choose to trust one of the interrogators and the suspect chooses to co-operate with the good cop, or merely complies out of fear of the bad cop. \nThe comic starts with the "Good Cop", the male police officer, and the "Dadaist Cop", Ponytail, working out their plan to interrogate the suspect, Hairy. After the Good Cop makes a few statements, intended to build trust with Hairy, and leaves to get coffee, Ponytail enters the interrogation and starts asking Hairy absurd questions. Hairy quickly becomes agitated, and questions what is wrong with Ponytail. \nGood Cop/Bad Cop hinges on the suspect\'s fear and distrust of the intentions of the bad cop; thankfully for the police, Ponytail\'s "Dadaist Cop" seems to be a successful Bad Cop too judging by the suspect\'s fear of her irrational, unpredictable, and potential crazy behavior (not to mention loud and aggressive mannerisms).\nThe title text builds on the joke as by asking a suspect to give the whereabouts of the money in a dadaist manner, which would be completely useless in finding it.  Such a statement could be used as a confession though.\n\n
