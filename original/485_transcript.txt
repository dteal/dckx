n\nThe comic is a companion piece to 482: Height, which explored a logarithmic scale from the edge of the observable universe down to the Earth\'s surface. Depth continues the process, viewing logarithmically smaller scales from Earth\'s atmosphere down to the interior of a single proton. This combination is reminiscent of Charles and Ray Eames\' 1977 short film Powers of Ten.\nHere\'s a walk through the entire comic:\n\n At the top we see a cutaway view of a story apartment complex. From left to right are a reference to 150: Grownups, Megan exorcising Windows Vista, Ponytail and Megan playing Guitar Hero or a similar game, Cueball at a desk, and what appear to be some sexytimes.\n The view descends into Cueball\'s tower PC.\n Entering the computer\'s internals, we see a mouse plugged into the PS/2 (6-pin mini-DIN) connector. This is a visual pun, since the mouse is an actual rodent and not a handheld device.\n Next we dive into the CPU. We see a multi-layered pun on the question "how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?" There may be a pun with a chip\'s connector pin, but the more obvious reference is Randall\'s answer of 32,767 = 215 - 1, the largest possible value of a signed 16-bit integer. Adding one rolls back over to -32,768, which is 32,768 devils or "negative angels." (See 571: Can\'t Sleep for a similar joke and a more elaborate explanation.)\n A blood-sucking mosquito appears to be "leeching" a torrent.\n A segfault is a problem with memory access.\n We zoom into a memory unit on the CPU. Cueball is being rickrolled, as indicated by the label "pixel on Rick Astley\'s shoulder."\n A "fork();" command points at one of several unlabeled spermatazoa. Forking and sperm are capable of spawning "child processes."\n Peter Norton is the founder of Norton Antivirus. He is shown fighting a biological virus, rather than informatic malware.\n Showing the relative scale of carbon nanotubes, the suggestion is that these then lead on to a more megastructural Space Elevator, for which carbon nanotubes are often cited as a suitably strong component needed for the cable.\n We soon zoom into a silicon atom in the CPU. In the electron cloud, the squiggles made out of arrows are Feynman diagrams. A Feynman diagram in the shape of a stick figure is saying "Sup?", a pun on the "Sup" particle (supersymmetric partner \'squark\' to the Up quark) and an abbreviation of the greeting "What\'s up?."\n An \'iPod Femto\' is shown, as a pun on the \'iPod Nano\' (both are SI prefixes), both of which refer to units far smaller than any iPod that has ever, or likely will ever, be created.\n Brian Greene is a theoretical physicist and pop scientist who discusses the nature of the universe. The picture of him knitting is a pun on string theory and PBS miniseries, The Fabric of the Cosmos.\n The Planck length (\xe2\x84\x93P) is the smallest theoretically measurable distance, defined by three fundamental constants in physics: the speed of light in a vacuum (c), Planck\'s constant (h), and the gravitational constant (G). The Planck length is vastly smaller than any known particle that isn\'t a point mass, and modern physics is a long way from being able investigate such a scale.\n\n1162: Log Scale and 482: Height are other comics about the use of log scales.\n\n
