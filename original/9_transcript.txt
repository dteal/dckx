n\nThis comic is about the release of the movie Serenity, which was supposed to be the sequel to Joss Whedon\'s TV show, Firefly, which was cancelled by Fox after only one season. Even three episodes were not shown on Fox but debuted on Sci Fi Channel in the UK. The show was followed by a devoted number of fans who were outraged by the cancellation of the show. High DVD sales and strong fan support allowed the follow up film Serenity to be created, which tied up many of the loose ends that Firefly left open, such as the cause of River\'s abilities and the origins of the reavers.\nThe image shows the main characters of Firefly. From left to right:\n\nMalcolm "Mal" Reynolds - the ship\'s captain.\nSimon Tam - a doctor trying to rescue his sister.\nHoban "Wash" Washburne - the ship\'s pilot.\nZoe Washburne - the ship\'s second-in-command.\nRiver Tam - Simon\'s sister, who displays superhuman capabilities, but is crippled by alliance research.\nKaylee Frye - the ship\'s happy-go-lucky mechanic.\nJayne Cobb - the hired muscle.\nInara Serra - a companion, the equivalent of a courtesan, but with a greater deal of respect.\nDerrial Book - a shepherd, which is similar to a priest, with a very unknown backstory.\n\nThis is the first xkcd with adorned stick figures (e.g. hair, coats, etc.) to represent distinct characters, which later becomes a standard motif of the comic.\nNathan Fillion, Summer Glau and Jewel Staite, the actors who play Mal, River and Kaylee respectively, show up later in Randall\'s series The Race.\n\n
