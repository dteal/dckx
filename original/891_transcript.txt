n\nBased on the person you are talking to, take their age on the far left, add "Did you realize that..." add the corresponding movie that is across from their age then "...came out..." add the phrase at the end of row.\nE.g. - If a person is 30, then it would go a little something like this "Did you realize that Home Alone came out more than 20 years ago?"\nThis would make people feel old because certain movies that they felt were close to them are actually aging quickly. In a way, this chart likens the age of the movie to the age of the person, as the person is about 10 years older than the movie, but as movies have shorter "life cycles" and seem to lose glory quickly, it seems that the movie is very old. However, the age at which a movie is accepted to be old is not nearly as large as the age at which a person is accepted to be old, so the person is not actually that old. This makes it seem that the person is far older than they actually are.\nAnd since this chart is designed to make someone feel old, anyone over 35 gets lumped in with "older people," which no one likes.\nThe title text states that if you are 15 or younger it is probably already  too late to be a child prodigy. This may be a reference to 447: Too Old For This Shit, in which Randall believes that anyone over the age of 11 has already missed out on their chance to become famous.\nRandall has covered making people feel old several times in 647: Scary, 973: MTV Generation, 1393: Timeghost and 1477: Star Wars.\n\n
