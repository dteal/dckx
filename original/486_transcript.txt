n\nIn a romantic relationship, some of the most horrifying words are arguably "We need to talk." They often stereotypically signal the beginning of a conversation that the speaker knows will cause the listener to become upset.\nIn this comic, Cueball is so horrified by hearing those words that he tries the ol\' "ninja smoke vanish" technique, only to have it fail miserably when the pellet provides insufficient visual cover to perform the trick, yet still sets off the smoke detector and then he can\'t get the window open to either leave the scene or just clear the less than useful cloud.
