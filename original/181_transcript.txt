n\nThe comic parodies the habit of word coining on the internet, as well as the enthusiasm for modern sounding terms in the IT world in general. Common examples include the shortening of "weblog" to "blog", while the entirety of blogs is referred to as the "blogosphere". The internet itself is sometimes called "The Tubes", a term derived from Senator Ted Stevens infamous statement "Series of Tubes". The suffixes "-net" and "-web" are often used to denote a certain interconnection of information on the internet, as well as to make products and brands sound fit for the 21st century.\nThe matrix shown in the comic spoofs the internet jargon by combining common pre- and suffixes to new and impressive but meaningless words. The culmination of nonsense is, as indicated in the transcript, the term "blagoblag". This is also a sideswipe at comic 148, where "blag" was introduced as a substitute for the usage of "blog". The official weblog of the xkcd webcomic is also called "blag". The prefix "blogo-", meanwhile, was used again in comic 239, titled Blagofaire.\n\n
