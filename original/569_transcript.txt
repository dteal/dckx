n\nCapture the flag (CTF) is a common way of playing games where the objective is to capture the opponent\'s flag while protecting your own team\'s flag. This comic describes a CTF server for an online war game where peace has been established and no one is trying to capture each other\'s flags, therefore making the game unexciting and pointless.\nThe title text refers to the line of flags in front of UN buildings. If such a collection of flags of all the teams were established on a server, one could get a very high score by quickly capturing all of them. \nA kajillion is slang for "an unspecified large number."\nLIATE is an acronym sometimes used when integrating by parts. The preferred part to integrate is "Logarithmic, Inverse-trig, Algebraic, Trig, Exponential." "Yarbis" could be a reference to an acronym in Turkish for "Y\xc4\xb1ld\xc4\xb1z ARastirmaci BIlgi Sistemi" which means "Yildiz Researcher Information System" in English. "Yildiz" refers to Yildiz Technical University in Turkey.\n\n
