n\nThis comic is all about college laundry habits and how as time goes by, you end up just throwing clothes on the floor and then wearing them again.\nIn the first week, the student undertakes a proper laundry routine. However, due to increasing laziness and stress from due assignments, by the second week they have abandoned folding their clothes, and by the third week no longer bother hanging them in the closet. By the second month dirty clothes are no longer stored in a laundry hamper and are just dumped on the floor, and by the end of the semester clothes are not washed at all.\nThe title text seems to indicate that the student has a brainwave sometime later, to wash their clothes in the dishwasher along with the dishes, presumably as a timesaver. The experiment was brief because dishwashers aren\'t actually any good at washing clothes as they wouldn\'t move the clothes about.\n\n
