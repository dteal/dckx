n\nA restraining order is a legal injunction requiring a party to do, or refrain from doing, certain acts, under penalty of fines or imprisonment, designed to safeguard the complainant\'s life. In general, they only set a minimum distance, never a maximum.\nThe joke in this comic is that Ponytail has gotten a restraining order against Cueball that requires him to stay between 500 yards (~457 m) and 600 yards (~549 m) of her at all times, which needless to say, will cause a major disruption to his life.\nThe title text says he\'ll have to get up early on Mondays and follow her jogging course along a parallel street.\nA yard is a unit of length used in the UK and the United States, 1 yard = exactly 0.9144 metre.\n\n
