n\nThis comic is about how it\'s considered implausible to "fly" by positioning an umbrella over a water jet. However, with a powerful enough jet of water, a strong enough umbrella, and a sure grip, such an event is physically plausible, although you\'d risk ripping your arm off.\nThe title text emphasize that Cueball did reach a high altitude.\nThe only mystery here is: A safe landing. On the other hand, if the umbrella is strong enough to haul him into the air, then maybe it can be used as a parachute as well...\n\n
