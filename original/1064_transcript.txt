n\nThis comic is showing in graphical form three different actions/feelings as Randall is approaching his front door at night. His "Fear That There\'s Something Behind Me" rises, so then his "Forward Speed" rises to get to his door faster. And then when he gets in the door and finds that in fact, there is nothing behind him, his "Embarrassment" rises. Note that the y-axis of the chart is not labeled, so it is presumed to indicate amount, as in how embarrassed Randall is.\nThe interesting fact revealed is that Randall gets more concerned that someone is behind him when he walks up the steps to this door, and not while walking in the yard where there might be more hiding places. The worst fear is just before he walks up the steps to lock him self in. This is probably because now that he is almost home and safe, he now has to fumble with the key concentrating on getting the key in the lock, thus not being able to pay attention to what\'s coming up behind him.\nThis is of course a very irrational thought, but it seems to happen to many people, and has certainly been used for suspense in many movies, whether it is "Did I hear a noise upstairs?" or "Is that an axe murderer hiding in that hedge?" or "Velociraptors lurking nearby". (However in all of these cases getting inside would probably not help you anyway just adding to the funny part of how the fear drops once inside. See 87: Velociraptors for why getting inside probably also would not help against them).\nThe title text attempts to alleviate the problem of the following embarrassment by introducing a greater one. Sure, knowing there might actually be a wolf behind you would prevent the embarrassment of realizing there isn\'t, but now that annoyance is replaced by the real threat of death.\n\n
