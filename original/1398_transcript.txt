n\nThe comic lists a few \'factoids\' about snakes, ranging from the mildly informative to the strictly tongue-in-cheek.\nThe first factoid references the hypothesis that snake venom was an evolutionary development of saliva that, over time, gradually became more toxic as snakes with saliva that was able to assist in subduing their prey possessed an evolutionary advantage. It then posits that the evolutionary branch that developed into venomous snakes began with a snake whose mutation gave him a mouth that was \'slightly more gross than usual\'.\nAdditionally, the comic illustration accompanying the second factoid colors in a \'habitat range\' on a map of South America that is snake-shaped, implying that when it states \'The longest snake is found in Brazil, Peru, and Chile\' that this snake is so long that it literally stretches from Brazil, across part of Peru, into Chile, and that the \'habitat\' shaded on the map is, in fact, this mammoth snake\'s silhouette. The age, length and location of the snake are so exaggerated that they are obviously untrue, but may be a reference to the Green Anaconda, one of the world\'s largest snakes, which inhabits this region.\nThe final factoid is entirely tongue-in-cheek. Many factoids come in the form "If you laid all the X end to end, Y would occur" (e.g. "If you laid all the veins and arteries in the human body end-to-end, they would stretch 60,000 miles"). The Y portion of the factoid is supposed to be surprising; therefore, it is ironic that the factoid in the comic, "If you laid all the bones in a snake end to end, you would have a snake.", is obvious and not at all exciting. Clearly, you would not have an entire snake, literally, but you would have a skeleton that was recognizably that of a snake and could reasonably be referred to as \'a snake\'.\nThe title text presents the amusing idea that \'snakes\' as we know them are not, in fact, a suborder of reptiles but are instead human digestive tracts that, rather than being a system of organs, are creatures capable of escaping from their \'host\' human and living independently. The idea seems to follow from the superficial resemblance between snakes and the human digestive tract as long, roughly tubular collections of animal matter, which can process the food entering the top end, and get rid of the waste through the other end.\nRandall had previously posted an incorrect map, that included the snake\'s habitat in Bolivia instead of Peru.\n\n
