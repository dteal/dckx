n\nIn this comic, Black Hat is putting bad reviews on all the hotels he has stayed at and likes and wants to stay in again, in order to lower demand for said hotel. He is simultaneously putting good reviews on bad hotels to steer other people there so there are more vacancies at good hotels. He claims he is not enough influence to put the good hotels out of business.\nThe Tragedy of the commons "is a dilemma arising from the situation in which multiple individuals, acting independently and rationally consulting their own self-interest, will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource, even when it is clear that it is not in anyone\'s long-term interest for this to happen." This situation is not a complete example of this concept as Black Hat is the only one doing it. He understands, however, that if others do it, it would apply.\nIn the last frame, Black Hat references the invisible hand which is the term economists use to describe the self-regulating nature of the marketplace. Black Hat appears to be taking advantage of this invisible hand by cutting it with a knife and eating it.\nThe title text is an example of Black Hat\'s negative review. It seems too extreme to believe, even in the context of the abysmal standards usually seen in such reviews. It is highly unlikely that there is an entire room filled with semen, and that the hotel clerk is filled with bedbugs. This might have the opposite of the intended effect, as the reader of the review might feel sarcasm.\n\n
