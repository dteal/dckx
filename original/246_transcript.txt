n\nThis comic alludes to a famous Knights and Knaves logic puzzle, and specifically to the version featured in the Jim Henson movie Labyrinth, with two doors and two guards. One guard always lies, and the other always tells the truth. One of the doors leads to freedom, and you can only ask one guard one question. The solution to this riddle involves a tricky question indeed. If you want to give the original puzzle a try for yourself, don\'t read the spoiler below.\n\nSolution: Ask one guard (it doesn\'t matter which one) which door the other guard would say leads out. Both guards will indicate the same door, which will be the door that doesn\'t lead out.\n\nBlack Hat added a third guard here who would stab his spear to Cueball on every tricky question. But even if the questions from before are not tricky enough to get stabbed there would be no helpful answer. And if Cueball asks one of the other guards the answers can\'t help to find the correct door. The only saving grace is that Black Hat has seemingly forgotten to impose the limit of a single question, but depending on how stab-happy the third guard is or is not this may not be enough.\nThe title text presents a typical behavior of Black Hat \xe2\x80\x94 no door in fact does lead out of this labyrinth.\n\n
