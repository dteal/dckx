n\nThis comic is a take on the anti-homosexual refrain, used often at those sorts of rallies "It was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve". This refrain is used to support the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman because in the old testament God created a man and a woman to start the human race. Adam and Eve are in the story in the Bible of the creation (Book of Genesis), and are the first pair of humans, created by God.\nAdam walks in on Eve having sexual relations with Abel, who is Adam\'s son, which turns the joke from a homosexual one into an incest one.\nIn the title text, Adam continues that he would have preferred walking in on Abel and Steve because Steve is not his wife.\n\n
