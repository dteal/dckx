n\nHere\'s the spreadsheet which Randall used to calculate the times and dates for the comic. It also has a lot of other percentages and dates, so take a look if you are interested.\nCueball/Randall creates this formula which helps him wait for long stretches of time which goes increasingly faster into the past as more time goes by, which gives him the effect of looking like the time goes by quickly.  Which assists in the waiting process.\nAs far as the actual math is concerned, the formula is an exponential function (i.e. the variable appears in the exponent). The effect that the function grows faster and faster as p grows, is due to T(p) being exponential. More precisely, when you repeatedly add some constant to the exponent, you will repeatedly multiply some (other) constant with the value of the function. Compare how "slow" a value grows by adding even high values (1, 1001, 2001, 3001, 4001, 5001\xe2\x80\xa6) and how fast it grows by multiplying even low values (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000\xe2\x80\xa6)\nNow, the function has to be adjusted so that, as Randall put it, "the time spent in each part of the past is loosely proportional to how well I know it." The most important adjustment is putting p to the power of three. That lowers the amount added to the exponent for low values (0.1\xc2\xb3=0.001, 0.2\xc2\xb3=0.008, i.e. only 7/1000 have been added for 10% workflow) and increases the amount for high values (0.8\xc2\xb3=0.512, 0.9\xc2\xb3=0.729, i.e. more than 1/5 has been added for 10% workflow). That means the recent past will pass even slower and the historic past even faster than it already does by choosing an exponential function.\nThe remaining adjustments are technical. The coefficient in front of p\xc2\xb3 adjusts the constant by which the result will be multiplied while adding some constant to p, while it also roughly ensures that p=1 yields the lifetime of the universe. The 3 added to the product in the exponent further adjusts the actual values of the power without touching the slope (the multiplicative constant). In the parentheses, e\xc2\xb3 is subtracted to put the time to 0 when p=0. Otherwise the function would start approx. 20 yrs and 1 month ago. For bigger p, this offset does not matter much. Imagine subtracting 20 yrs from the lifetime of the universe!\nFinally, the result is subtracted from the current date for aesthetical reasons. The formula could tell you "20 yrs ago", or it could read "February 1992". Randall decided the latter would be better.\n(Also, the workout website, Fitocracy has been mentioned previously in xkcd.)\nNote that as of the time that this page was last cached, the comic was uploaded at 10.157790564005% progress.\n\n
