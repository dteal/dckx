n\nThe solid line represents the theoretical radiation for a blackbody at 2.73 K according to Planck\'s Law (derived as early as 1900 by Max Planck). The formula, almost as written in the graph, can be found here. The only changes are that on Wikipedia, the frequency f is represented by the Greek letter \xce\xbd (nu) and the temperature T is included as an independent variable, so I(f) becomes I(v,T). However, I(v,T) still represents the spectral radiance (similar to energy density). In this formula, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light in a vacuum and k is the Boltzmann constant. The frequency (f or v) along the X-axis is measured in GHz (Giga (or billion) Herz). The curve peaks at 160.4&#160;GHz. There is no scale or unit on the energy density on the Y-axis.\nThe theory is that the blackbody in question was in fact the universe at the point when it had cooled down enough to allow photons to escape, 0.38 billion years into the universe\'s 13.8 billion years history. The photons that reach us today are the ones that have been travelling to us at lightspeed since then. As the light from astronomical objects suffers from redshift due to the expansion of the universe, and this shift becomes more pronounced with distance from the observer, this light displays in the infrared range.\nThe title text praises viewers who can identify where this equation and corresponding graph come from (without consulting this wiki, of course).\n\n
