n\nIn college courses with a very large number of students (picture the huge, tiered, amphitheater-style lecture halls shown in any movie or TV show about college), teaching assistants are employed to help the professors grade student work. In math and science courses, students are expected to solve the problems and show their work as supporting evidence. Due to the high volume of work to grade, whether it\'s being done by the professor or a TA, the grader will get lazy and look for correct answers and the existence of work without checking that the work is accurate.\nThe math switches from \xe2\x88\x9a being square root notation to it being division notation midway. That is an illegal operation. But the correct answer is reached anyway, because 27 is the correct answer to 3 &#215; 9, 3\xe2\x88\x9a81, and 81 &#247; 3.\nMore generally, this pattern holds true for any number and its square; namely, \xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\xf0\x9d\x91\xa6 = \xf0\x9d\x91\xa6&#178; &#247; \xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 whenever \xf0\x9d\x91\xa6 = x&#178; &#160; (... namely, x*y = y^2/x whenever y=x^2) .\n\n
