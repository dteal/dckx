n\nThis comic refers to the Terminator series, in which a super-intelligent machine from the future time travels back in time to kill Sarah Connor.\nHowever, we currently have "robots" (actually vehicles controlled remotely by people) that are able to attack specific locations and targets. Originally, UAV were only used for surveillance and reconnaissance. But, now more than ever, they are used for attacks. One thing that keeps us short of a Terminator scenario is that most of the unmanned aerial vehicles are either pre-programmed or flown remotely by members of the military, and are not left to their own devices.\nThe last panel shows a Predator, heavily used for offensive operations by the USAF and the CIA in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nThe title text depicts that we have entered a new era; Cueball (or Kyle Reese) with his shotgun has no chance to protect Sarah.\nSimilar buildup and Terminator reference are to be found in 1177: Time Robot.\n\n
