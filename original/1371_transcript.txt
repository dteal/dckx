n\nExoplanets are planets outside of our solar system, and exoplanet astronomers are astronomers who attempt to discover and study such planets.\nMegan is using a common exoplanet discovery technique to discover a planet around a nearby star. When a planet passes between an observing astronomer and a star, the planet will block some tiny part of the light coming from that star, causing it to appear dimmer for some amount of time. The Kepler telescope used this technique to find evidence for exoplanets.\nBut here Megan is standing on the surface of the Earth at night, looking at the ground, and therefore presumably looking in the direction of the sun. By observing that it is completely occluded at night, she correctly concludes that the Sun is orbited by at least one planet: the Earth.\nThe title text alludes to using more complicated techniques to observe light reflected by small planets like the Earth, for example by detecting polarized light reflected from the planet\'s atmosphere. In some sense, observing the light that reflects off of the Earth during the day is in fact how we see everything around us. It also implies that astronomers, who because of their career choice are more likely to work at night, might be completely unaware of Earth\'s existence in the daytime and thus surprised to "discover" it from their nighttime work.\nThe title text may also be a reference to 1231: Habitable Zone where an astronomer is messed up by someone who puts a mirror in front of the telescope.\nMore details at: Methods of detecting exoplanets.\n\n
