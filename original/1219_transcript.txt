n\nThe quoted text of the report could (and indeed probably would, given the apparent contents) be stereotypically read out loud by the author, or internally by the reader, in an essentially monotonal manner, as exhibited by any number of popularised film and TV characters such as \'Arthur Pewtey\' from the Monty Python sketch. But this comic asks us to imagine it instead voiced in the voice of an upset (soon-to-be-\'ex-\'?) spouse, presumably berating the project leader on various real or imagined infractions, and it works just as well. The jagged nature of the speech bubble indicates that the report has typed out on the computer\'s screen, but also helps to re-enforce the nagging internal voice.\nThe title text joke relates to an alternative plan, namely to proportionally exaggerate everything you read.  What would have been one serious accident that would have been prevented in the previous month had the speed limit been 25&#160;mph, out of the three that actually occurred under the current limit, now becomes one thousand people saved!  And all those lives would have been saved by reducing the speed limit to a \'mere\' 25,000 miles per hour. Of course, around 2000 accidents would not have been prevented because people still try to mess with vehicles that are moving at hypersonic velocities.\nNote that the title text is inconsistent; if every number were to be multiplied by a thousand, then the speed limit would apply to 2000th Street. Somewhat surprisingly, there do exist streets of this name, mainly in Illinois. Though in this case 2nd St is a proper noun and thus should not be modified.\n\n
