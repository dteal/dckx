n\nOrganizations such as Steam often offer sales where certain games are available for low prices--in order to compel or persuade buyers to make donations to worthwhile charities. Cueball is participating in one of these purchases (to fight malaria), but Megan\'s snide denigration of Cueball\'s act of charity as inadequate and self-serving has dissuaded him from any act of charity at all. People donating to charity are in fact buying a feeling that they are good people doing good things. If you take this feeling away, many people stop donating, which is shown on the third panel.\nHowever, whatever somebody\'s internal motivation was, charity is a good thing. Therefore the proper response, is to neither care what people say about you nor attack other people\'s charitable giving. The action that Randall recommends here is the right one, which is to donate anyway without caring about what others say or do.
