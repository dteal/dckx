n\nFirst off, three references have to be explained:\n\n"Counterstrike" is a reference to the Half-Life mod Counter-Strike, and its subsequent sequel. In the Counter-Strike series, you are either a terrorist or a counter terrorist operative and your goal is to stop the other from completing their objective. On a dark map, players would generally use night vision goggles which don\'t produce light which would give away their position to the enemy.\n"Pwned" is a typical online gaming term meaning beaten, killed or trapped/tricked.\nThe "grue" is a predator in the game franchise Zork. Grues fear light, but love to devour adventurers entering the dark. Therefore, you cannot win the game without owning some light source.\n\nZork is a typical text-adventure, in which you play turn-based (like chess). The computer spits out some textual context, you enter a command (GO &lt;direction&gt;, TAKE &lt;object&gt;, KILL &lt;person&gt;, LOOK AT &lt;object&gt; etc.), and the computer responds by giving the outcome of your command. This scarce context arose from the fact that games in the 1970s and 1980s needed to run on limited memory and microprocessor capacity. During the last 20 years, these barriers were broken down, and games in graphical context, and running in real-time were made possible.\nRandall returns Counterstrike to the text-context of Zork, stating thereby that no player used to the real-time, graphical atmosphere of the former would have any appeal to the turn and text-based dynamics of the latter. And yes, that indeed is an initiation to the discussion mentioned in the image text.\nThe title text mentions adventure games from the early days of personal computers like the IBM-XT, Atari, or C64. That games were based on an interactive story and the player had to solve a puzzle on this by only communicating to the application using a keyboard or later even a mouse. The more modern way of playing games is the genre of Role Playing Games (RPG) where the player controls a character who changes in ability and often involve a combat component.\n\n
