n\nThis comic shows an imagined crossover between the film series The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and video game series Mario Kart. The principle referred to is the drifting effect in most versions of the game: as shown in the cartoon, during a drift the kart could be turned left and right to create a splay of blue sparks and give a small, temporary "mini-boost" to the speed of the kart. The made-up title "The Fast &amp; The Furious Tokyo Dash!!" also refers to one of the games that features the effect, "Mario Kart: Double Dash!!".\nAt the title text Randall jokes about shopping in a supermarket; when he steers his shopping cart around a corner he pretends that he is getting the blue boost sparks.\n\n
