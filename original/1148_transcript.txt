n\nI have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat is a famous phrase in a speech given by Winston Churchill, which would be heard on the radio in the 1940s. The comic then goes on to list numerous other increasingly obscure bodily fluids, including through the title text, ending humorously with gin (which Churchill was partial to).\nThe fluids in order: blood, tears, sweat, spit, bile, vomit, urine, mucus, semen, earwax, lymph, gastric acid, sebum, pus, endolymph, intracellular fluid, blood plasma, vitreous humor, feces, pleural cavity fluid, chyle, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, pericardial fluid, sputum, aqueous humor, perilymph, chyme, hydatid fluid, interstitial fluid, and rheum. The partially obscured ones near the end are taken by process of elimination. CHLY- seems to be a typo for CHYL(E).\n\n
