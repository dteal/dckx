n\nThis comic is a parody of the movie The Social Network, a movie about the founding of the popular social network site Facebook. Here, scenes from the movie are reimagined to feature Zombo.com instead. Zombo.com, also known as Zombocom, is a website that was created in 1999 and using only Flash animations. Randall, like many others more, doesn\'t like this technique at all. The animation consists of a circle of quickly pulsating dots and a friendly&#91;citation needed&#93; deep male voice repeatedly welcoming the visitor to "Zombocom" and explaining that there was no limit to what could be done at the site, or rather, no limit except yourself. The message repeats while, ironically, there is absolutely nothing that can be done at the site. \nTurn on your speakers and check zombo.com for yourself.\nThe title text could also be a reference to the fact that, back in 1999, there weren\'t really that many people on the internet.\n\n
