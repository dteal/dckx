n\nSu Doku (Japanese for "single number", and now usually written as "sudoku") is a type of number puzzle, in which the player must place digits in a matrix field in the correct order. The most common arrangement is a 9&#215;9 grid subdivided into nine 3&#215;3 grids where no digit is allowed to appear twice in a horizontal or vertical row on that full 9&#215;9 matrix. The number and combination of pre-filled squares determines the difficulty of the puzzle. When the puzzle is solved each row and column will contain the numbers 1 to 9 in a particular order.\nRandall presents just a binary sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku uses 9 digits, usually 1 to 9, and so fits conveniently into our normal "decimal" counting system (ten digits). \nThe joke is that the binary system has only two digits (0 and 1), and therefore binary sudoku puzzles would be trivially easy and thus pointless. The puzzle in the comic would be completed by filling 0 in the top-left and 1 in the bottom-left empty box. The only other possible grid would have the 0s and 1s swapped. This fulfills the criteria of having no repeated digits in any row or column.\nThe title text appears to reference a series of published sudoku puzzle books called the "Martial Arts Sudoku". The difficulty of each book is denoted by a martial arts belt color, with each color representing a certain skill level. A red belt is a rather high level, second only to the black belt. When applied to binary sudokus, a sudoku with one number given would be the most difficult one (though still trivial) and thus be a black belt. While this sudoku has two numbers given, hence the medium red belt level.\n\n
