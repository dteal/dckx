n\nSnopes is a popular website for checking the validity of urban legends. Snopes proves or disproves facts, but another urban legend is known that suggests Snopes runs a spam operation to create sources for their own benefit. The joke here is that Snopes disproves its own urban legend, creating a circular, invalid argument.\nThe title text suggests that MythBusters, another group which debunks myths, also participate in the practice of spreading misinformation for the opportunity to test it.\n\n
