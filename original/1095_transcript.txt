n\nA subculture is a small group of people within a culture that share some property in common, such as hackers or hipsters. Some subcultures form based on a geeky obsession over a trivial topic (for instance, a minimally-drawn webcomic). In this case, that topic is crazy straws, which are toy drinking straws designed with unusual twists and loops.  This strip uses this group as an example of the fractal nature of cultures.\nInformally speaking, a fractal is a mathematical shape with an infinite level of detail. Just as fractals can always be divided into smaller patterns, Randall points out that human subcultures can always be divided into smaller subcultures. We have the "people who like crazy straws" subculture, but this is further divided into the professionals and the hobbyists. The hobbyists are themselves broken into those who accept loops in the straws and those who don\'t. A splinter group, as used in the comic, is a subculture that breaks off from a larger one.\nDespite the incredible amount of work fans put into it, the whole concept seems completely inconsequential to an outsider. The irony is the source of humor in this strip. An earlier comic, 915: Connoisseur, covers a similar topic.\nParis Hilton is a celebrity who is essentially famous for being famous.\n\n
