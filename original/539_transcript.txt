n\nIn statistics, statistical significance is used to measure how well a set of data demonstrates a particular hypothesis or statement. In particular, it makes judgment about how likely that the observed effect is real, and not just the result of a sampling anomaly.  The term significant other is used to refer to a person\'s intimate relation, typically a spouse or a long-term boyfriend or girlfriend.  They are the "significant other" person in their life, apart from themselves.\nMegan asserts her claim that Cueball is her boyfriend by presenting the time that he had spend with people in the form of a box plot, (sometimes called a box-and-whisker plot) with her data point lying far ahead of the rest of the chart, which signifies that Cueball has spent more time with Megan than anyone else. Cueball accepts her claim, and she responds with a monumental pun that combines the phrases "statistically significant" and "significant other".\nThe title text illustrates the low esteem in which bad puns are commonly held: even though she proved her point, Cueball takes the only option left to him, which is to break up with her. Also it is typical stereotype of men, that once they realize they have dated someone so long as to be called a boyfriend, then they break up, because they do not wish that any girl makes a claim on them.\n\n
