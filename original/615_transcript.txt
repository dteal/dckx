n\nMegan gave her number to Cueball at a party, but now doesn\'t want to talk to him. Because Megan works with recording voice messages at Verizon, she can with no effort put on the characteristical semi-lifeless tone of professional automated answers, and answer the phone with the "call cannot be completed"-message. Perhaps it was even she who recorded it in the first place.\nThe title text is a reference to Randall\'s Hobby series and can be interpreted as Reverse Turing test with Cueball imitating an Interactive voice response system.\n\n
