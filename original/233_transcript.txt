n\nA CAPTCHA is a verification system to stop automatic submissions to web forms by asking the user to do something which a computer program could not do, such as type a distorted word into a box.\nBut here, the author has a new CAPTCHA, in which it references a sad event in a children\'s movie (The Land Before Time), asks the subject if it felt sad. If the subject is human, then they most likely will have felt sad, so the answer will be \'"yes." If it\'s a computer program, however, it is supposed to answer "no," because computer programs cannot feel.\nThe title text references to the Futurama episode Jurassic Bark. It claims that this episode is so sad that even spambots cry after seeing it.\n\n
