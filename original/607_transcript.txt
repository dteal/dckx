n\nThe 2038 problem is a well-known problem with 32-bit Unix-based operating systems. Unix time is stored as a 32-bit signed integer on these systems, counting the number of seconds since 1970. In 2038, we overflow the highest number we can store in 32-bit integers, leading to unexpected behavior. The switch to 64-bit operating systems will most likely be complete by the year 2038, which is why the speaker is relieved. The reference to Y2K is a throwback to the year 2000 problem, in which people were concerned that computers storing digits as two numbers (e.g.: 99 to represent 1999) would cause problems when the year 2000 began because 00 could have been interpreted as 1900 by error. That Y2K issue was covered widely \xe2\x80\x94 with only some small mishaps \xe2\x80\x94 but calculating dates beyond 2038 is still not solved on many 32-bit UNIX based systems today. The "even WORSE" is a play on the fact that even being "even worse" than the actual results of Y2K doesn\'t necessarily mean it will be particularly bad, Y2K resulting in very few serious problems, especially in light of the hype that preceded it.\nThe title text is a reference to the film "2012" which is about the world ending in December of 2012, at the end of the Mayan calendar. If the designers of the UNIX operating system had used 1944 as their epoch instead of 1970, then the UNIX crash due to a variable overflow would coincide with the end of the Mayan calendar. Thus, the implication is that there could have been a boring scene in the movie where the UNIX time rolls over and nothing happens and no one cares \xe2\x80\x94 because the world doesn\'t exist any more.\n\n
