n\nThis comic references the fantasy novel series "The Chronicles of Narnia" by C. S. Lewis. In the second book (and the first movie), four children discover the fictional world of Narnia which can be accessed through a wardrobe.\nThe comic mocks at the imprudent behaviour shown by the protagonists of the novel, who enter the world of Narnia without knowing anything about its dangers. In the comic, Megan discovers the magical wardrobe while playing hide-and-seek. Unlike the original characters, Megan does not precipitately set foot into Narnia. Instead, she fetches her technical equipment and sends a remote-controlled probe through the wardrobe door in order to sound the situation first.\nThis procedure of sending a probe first can be seen in the early Stargate episodes.  This draws a parallel between the wardrobe in Narnia and the Stargate, both connecting two distant worlds.  The stargate probe can be seen at http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Mobile_Analytic_Laboratory_Probe\nThe probe can be seen in the sixth and eighth panel, encountering Mr. Tumnus the faun with an umbrella at a lamppost in a snowy wood on the last panel. This picture is the first impression of Narnia in the novels and was apparently Lewis\' original idea for the series.\nThe White Witch mentioned in the title text is the main antagonist in the novel. She originally lures one of the protagonists with a hot drink and Turkish delight. In the scenario displayed in the comic, she tries to tempt the probe with a firmware update accordingly.\nMegan takes a scientific approach to Narnia again in a later comic.\n\n
