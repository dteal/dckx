n\nA rotational matrix transformation (i.e. the big brackets with a few "cos" and "sin" in them) is used in computer graphics to rotate an image. In general, to rotate a point [a1, a2] in a 2D space by z\xc2\xb0 clockwise, you can multiply it by the rotation matrix [cos z\xc2\xb0, sin z\xc2\xb0; -sin z\xc2\xb0, cos z\xc2\xb0]. In this case, the left side of the equation is rotating [a1, a2] by 90\xc2\xb0. Simplifying the trigonometry, the 90\xc2\xb0 clockwise rotation matrix is [ 0, 1; -1, 0], so multiplying this by [a1, a2], you should get [a2, -a1]. \nThe joke is that the author performed the rotation transformation on the image of the vector rather than just the vector itself. \nRotational matrix transformations are a special case of the general linear matrix transform, which can do other things to images, including the other two affine transformations of scaling them or translating (moving) them.  On a pedantic note, normally mathematics uses counterclockwise as a default, although computer graphics frequently use a clockwise default, so this may be an intentional reference.\nSo the title text may be referring to the professors going home (translation) and shrinking (scaling) from the joke.\n\n
