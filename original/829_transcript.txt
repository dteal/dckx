n\nThree scientists, are worried that the press conference announcing their bacteria discovery be less exciting to the reporters especially because they are expecting news of life on Saturn\'s largest moon, Titan. The researchers decide to try and make the event more exciting, but they don\'t know how to throw a good party. As a result, they look up advice on the internet, and decide to serve cocktails and hors d\'\xc5\x93uvres to fit the theme of the event. \nThe final panel shows the results, the reporters are dead or dying. It is implied that in order to fit the theme the researchers have laced the food and drinks with arsenic. \nArsenic is a chemical element which is known to be poisonous to humans and most other life forms. In 2010 NASA announced the discovery of bacteria GFAJ-1 and claimed it to be able to sustain itself when starved of phosphorus, by substituting arsenic for a small percentage of its phosphorus. Most scientists did not believe in this and it was disproven in 2012.[1]\nThe comic draws its humor by picking on both scientists and reporters. It is a common theme in xkcd to show scientist who may be extremely clever within their field, but sometimes lack common sense and are inept at social situations. Reporters are often criticized for over sensationalizing discoveries and hunting for exciting stories. \n\n
