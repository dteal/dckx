n\nThis comic seems to be a follow up to 1115: Sky.\nLast panel refers to cloud computing and specifically cloud storage, and looks like a follow up to 1032: Networking. The obvious joke is that, instead of cloud-like storage, Beret Guy\'s business is storage of clouds.\nThe title text is a statement from Randall, that his first words came while looking up at the sky. Randall has a good grasp on what in this universe is awe-inspiring.\nThere are some connections with both 908: The Cloud and the title text of 1444: Cloud.\n\n
