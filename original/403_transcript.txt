n\nA graph is a mathematical object consisting of nodes connected by lines called edges. The nodes could represent for example people, and the edges could represent a connection from having slept together. Now, Megan has such a graph. Arguably, a graph that is symmetric is nicer than a regular one, which is why Megan suggests that they should sleep together.\nThe title text is a small-world joke on the concept of Erd\xc5\x91s number. Paul Erd\xc5\x91s was a Hungarian mathematician renowned for his eccentricity and productivity. He holds the world record for the number of published math papers, as well as for the number of collaborative papers. A person\'s Erd\xc5\x91s number is the "collaborative distance" between the person and Erd\xc5\x91s. Paul Erd\xc5\x91s\'s Erd\xc5\x91s number is 0 by definition. All of his 511 collaborators have the Erd\xc5\x91s number 1; anyone (excluding Erd\xc5\x91s) who has collaborated on a mathematical or scientific paper with any of those collaborators has an Erd\xc5\x91s number of 2, and so on. Thus, if you have written a paper with someone who\'s written a paper with someone who\'s written a paper with Paul Erd\xc5\x91s, your Erd\xc5\x91s number is 3. If you know a mathematician or are a mathematician you can calculate his/her/your Erd\xc5\x91s number here.\nThe Collaboration Graph is the graph where each edge represents two people collaborated on a mathematical paper together, and the people represented are those with an Erd\xc5\x91s number. Some of Erd\xc5\x91s\'s colleagues have published papers about the properties of the Collaboration Graph, treating it as if it were a real mathematical object. One of these papers made the observation that the graph would have a certain very interesting property if two particular points had an edge between them. To make the Collaboration Graph have that property, the two disconnected mathematicians immediately got together, proved something trivial, and wrote up a joint paper. Explained here.\nIn 599: Apocalypse Cueball actually manages to write a paper with zombie Erd\xc5\x91s, thus making his Erd\xc5\x91s numbers one.\n\n
