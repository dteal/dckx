n\nA common theme of xkcd is that one never feels that one has "transitioned to adulthood", in the sense of actually attaining the seriousness and sense of responsibility that children imagine all adults to possess. Here, the author illustrates this by imagining Cueball and Megan taking on the ultimate "adult responsibility" \xe2\x80\x94 having a child, treating it as they would any other engineering project. Disassembling a project to check the parts is an activity that is appropriate for a self-built computer or robot, but disassembling a child would be impractical. It would also kill the child.&#91;citation needed&#93; Megan also shows her lack of child experience by holding the baby upside-down by the foot, which isn\'t a good idea.&#91;citation needed&#93; Her behavior could also indicate that Megan is treating the child as an object rather than a human being.\nThe title text implies the author will have kids someday. It will be surprising if they read this comic, not just because it will give them an unflattering look into their father\'s attitudes on having children, but because he plans to lock them in the cellar where there will be no internet access. This is possibly a reference to Kaspar Hauser, who is a boy that was claimed to have grown up in a dark cell in Germany in the 19th century, or to the incestuous children of Josef Fritzl.\nThis is also the topic of 674: Natural Parenting and 1384: Krypton.\nMuch later, a comic with the singular version of this title was released: 1650: Baby. Here, Cueball refrains from saying something as stupid as he does here about another couple\'s baby. The couple looks similar to the one in this comic, though that may just be due to the basic-looking art style of xkcd.\n\n
