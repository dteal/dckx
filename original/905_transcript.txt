n\nOne common annoyance of renters is the inability to make simple changes to their dwelling &#8212; for example, drilling a hole in a wall to hang a picture &#8212; without having to ask for permission from the property owner.  In many cases, if the renter drills the hole without asking permission, he or she is charged for repairs.  This is one reason that home ownership can be empowering, as it allows the owner to do anything they wish with their property. This can lead to mishaps however, as shown in the comic when Cueball drills holes in the house to prove his ownership, to the point of structural instability.  Cueball\'s last statement expresses the fact that he was actually better off having someone who could dictate what could and could not be done with his residence. \nThe title text references the (fictional) fact that 60% of the toxic assets involved in the United States housing bubble were created by power drills. The implication being that Cueball is not alone in his hole drilling tendencies which created not only structural collapse of the homes, but also the financial collapse of the market as those houses would now be worth far lass then the mortgages placed against them.\n\n
