n\nThis comic is a joke about jumping to conclusions based on a simplistic understanding of probability. The "base rate fallacy" is a mistake where an unlikely explanation is dismissed, even though the alternative is even less likely. In the comic, a device tests for the (highly unlikely) event that the sun has exploded. A degree of random error is introduced, by rolling two dice and lying if the result is double sixes. Double sixes are unlikely (1 in 36, or about 3% likely), so the statistician on the left dismisses it. The statistician on the right has (we assume) correctly reasoned that the sun exploding is far more unlikely, and so is willing to stake money on his interpretation.\nThe labels given to the two statisticians, in their panels and in the comic\'s title, are not particularly fair or accurate, a fact which Randall has acknowledged:[1]\n\nI seem to have stepped on a hornet\xe2\x80\x99s nest, though, by adding \xe2\x80\x9cFrequentist\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBayesian\xe2\x80\x9d titles to the panels. This came as a surprise to me, in part because I actually added them as an afterthought, along with the final punchline. \xe2\x80\xa6 The truth is, I genuinely didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize Frequentists and Bayesians were actual camps of people\xe2\x80\x94all of whom are now emailing me. I thought they were loosely-applied labels\xe2\x80\x94perhaps just labels appropriated by the books I had happened to read recently\xe2\x80\x94for the standard textbook approach we learned in science class versus an approach which more carefully incorporates the ideas of prior probabilities.\nThe "frequentist" statistician is (mis)applying the common standard of "p&lt;0.05". In a scientific study, a result is presumed to provide strong evidence if, given that the null hypothesis, a default position that the observations are unrelated (in this case, that the sun has not gone nova), there is less than a 5% chance that the result was merely random. (The null hypothesis was also referenced in 892: Null Hypothesis.)\nSince the likelihood of rolling double sixes is below this 5% threshold, the "frequentist" decides (by this rule of thumb) to accept the detector\'s output as correct. The "Bayesian" statistician has, instead, applied at least a small measure of probabilistic reasoning (Bayesian inference) to determine that the unlikeliness of the detector lying is greatly outweighed by the unlikeliness of the sun exploding. Therefore, he concludes that the sun has not exploded and the detector is lying.\nThe line, "Bet you $50 it hasn\'t", is a reference to the approach of a leading bayesian scholar, Bruno de Finetti, who made extensive use of bets in his examples and thought experiments. See Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy) for more information on his work. In this case, however, the bet is also a joke because we would all be dead if the sun exploded.  If the Bayesian wins the bet, he gets money, and if he loses, they\'ll both be dead before money can be paid. This underlines the absurdity of the premise and emphasizes the need to consider context when examining probability.\nThe title text refers to a classic series of logic puzzles known as Knights and Knaves, where there are two guards in front of two exit doors, one of which is real and the other leads to death. One guard is a liar and the other tells the truth. The visitor doesn\'t know which is which, and is allowed to ask one question to one guard. The solution is to ask either guard what the other one would say is the real exit, then choose the opposite. Two such guards were featured in the 1986 Jim Henson movie Labyrinth, hence the mention of "A LABYRINTH GUARD" here.\n\n
