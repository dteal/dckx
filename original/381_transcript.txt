n\n  The M\xc3\xb6bius comic strip as an animated GIF.\nA M\xc3\xb6bius strip is an object with only one surface and one edge. It can be created by taking a strip of paper and twisting it 180 degrees before taping both ends together.\nThe idea of the M\xc3\xb6bius strip has been used here to create a comic strip that could potentially loop forever. In it, a man is standing in front of a ball. Then another man runs in and kicks the first man out of the panel. The second man then turns away, retaining the first man\'s original position, only flipped horizontally. Because of the nature of the M\xc3\xb6bius strip, if the comic strip were to be printed out in such a way that the comic could be seen on both sides of the paper, the comic would repeat, so that the second man would become the first man, and someone else, potentially the original first person, would push them out of the comic becoming himself the first man.\nThe comic\'s viability as a M\xc3\xb6bius strip is preserved the use of symmetrical letters in a palindromic word to denote laughing ("HAHAHAH") as well as using symmetrical punctuation for the other character\'s grawlixes.  A similar use of a M\xc3\xb6bius strip in story-telling can be seen in Wind and Mr. Ug by Vi Hart.\nFinally, at the title text, Randall jokes that he would like to see actual films do this solely as a joke on projectionists, who would have a difficult time feeding a Mobius strip film reel properly into a normal projector due to the twist.\n\n
