n\nMost people will eventually develop an intuitive feel for how big certain measurements are (e.g., how long an inch or a foot is, how much a pound weighs). This comic points out that people who were brought up using the United States system of customary units probably don\'t have the same intuitive understanding for metric units and attempts to provide some benchmarks for these people. Most of the benchmarks are common sense, highly-useful ones (e.g., if it\'s 30 degrees Celsius, you\'d be quite comfortable outside dressed for the beach) but some of the benchmarks are humorous and/or completely useless as can be seen below.\nIn the book Thing Explainer a similar chart for metrics is shown in the explanation for How to count things, with four of the five measures from this comic also explained in simple language. Only volume is left out there. Only thing used in both explanations is the weight of a cat, but in the book it weighs 5 kg rather than 4 kg in this comic.\n\n
