n\nThe comment to which Cueball is referring is a tweet by Neil deGrasse Tyson, an American astrophysicist and science communicator. As of this comic, Tyson is the "Frederick P. Rose Director" (a special honorary title) of the Hayden Planetarium. He has appeared on many different shows, ranging from The Discovery Channel to The Big Bang Theory.\nThere are a number of conspiracy theories claiming that the moon landing was a hoax. Tyson offers a pretty compelling argument against them, but Megan presents an even more convincing refutation, snarkily implying that NASA really hasn\'t done anything spectacular since 1969.\nAnd Cueball responds with a pun on the word "burn". Burn can mean a particularly effective insult, or it can mean the consumption of fuel for propulsion. In this case, the "burn" was so effective it pushed the spaceship out of orbit (which usually takes a very large amount of burning, depending on the gravity of the planet or moon).\nIn the title text Randall mentions many successful NASA unmanned missions:\n\nThe Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which landed in 2004. Opportunity has been working for over ten years on the surface of Mars; Spirit got stuck in 2009 and shut down for good in 2010. See this comic: 695: Spirit.\nKepler found many exoplanets\nNew Horizons is a mission to the dwarf planet Pluto and beyond. It did a flyby of Pluto in July 2015 and is on its way out of the solar system.\nCassini is a probe orbiting Saturn since 2004.\nCuriosity is another, larger Mars rover, exploring the Martian surface since August 2012.\nTiME is a proposed mission to explore the oceans of Saturn\'s moon Titan.\nProject M is an idea to send human-like robots to the Moon.\n\nThe final sentence of title text notes that all manned missions since the Moon landings have taken place in low-earth orbit, which is barely far off of the Earth\'s surface. If the Earth were scaled to the size of a regulation basketball, approximately 24&#160;cm (9\xc2\xbc inches) in diameter, those manned missions would have all taken place within 1.25&#160;cm (\xc2\xbd inch) of the ball\'s surface. At this scale the Moon would be at a distance of 7.7&#160;m (25.3&#160;ft). Unmanned missions, such as those named above or the Voyager and Mariner probes of the 1960s and 1970s, have travelled much further.\n\n
