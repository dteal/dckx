n\nMegan and Cueball are teachers at this comic, talking about their students and the political discussions with them. They outline that it\'s not possible to find the real truth. But then Cueball, interrupted by a harrumph of the mathematics teacher Miss Lenhart, states that Mathematics is an exception (because math can actually be proved, conclusively). Randall likes mathematics because their discussions as in politics are not possible.\nThe title text shows a simple valid mathematical equation, the distributive property, and Randall is daring one to politicize it. Though this happened years after the comic was published, people have in fact politicized the distributive property, claiming it promoted socialism.\n\n
