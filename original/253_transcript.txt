n\nSome classical but inaccurate interchanges are shown. In general, these interchanges are designed to allow the traffic to flow without directly crossing any other traffic stream. But here we can see some different approaches:\n\nThe first design resembles a cloverleaf interchange, but has no way to merge back onto the highway once you enter it, making it inescapable.\n\nThe second interchange has off-ramps that you would normally use to change to the other highway, but in this design they simply merge back to the original highway, so you don\'t really have a choice in where to go. This is sometimes seen on real freeways where one lane must go around an obstacle such as a bridge support.\n\nThe rotary has a path that puts cars from opposite sides of the rotary onto a collision course. This is a humorous reference to particle accelerators (such as the Superconducting Super Collider) which are designed to put particles on a collision course.\n\nIn the title text Boston is mentioned, a slightly more complicated prank in itself. A common fiction is that the streets evolved from old cowpaths; but in the 17th century they avoided swamps and marshes and followed shorelines before the original peninsula comprising the city was expanded with landfill in the 19th century. Boston\'s road infrastructure in general lacks a street grid like most other US-cities have. On top of that, roads change names and lose and add lanes seemingly at random. Randall, who lives in Boston, seems to be venting frustration.\nHighway engineers were also the subject of 781: Ahead Stop and 1726: Unicode.\n\n
