n\nAn unidentified narrator, probably Randall, says how he saw a kid with a balloon stand next to a ceiling fan in a restaurant. He explains how for fifteen minutes, he watched the kid\'s balloon, hoping the balloon would get caught in the ceiling fan and make the kid fly up towards it. This looks like it could cause serious injury to the child, hence the title text of how you\'re a bad person if this is what you sit in restaurants and imagine.\n\n
