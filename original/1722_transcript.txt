n\nCueball is telling White Hat about his attempt at debugging, i.e. the process of finding out what is wrong with a given computer problem, which can become increasingly difficult and convoluted. In this case, Cueball had a problem with his browser. His attempts to solve this problem led him to a problem with the device driver for his keyboard. Chasing that issue, he found an unclear error message from a system utility, and so on.\nCueball decides to "make a long story short" by skipping several steps he believes are boring, and he unexpectedly reveals this process has led him to find the \xe2\x80\x9cSword of Martin the Warrior\xe2\x80\x9d, a legendary relic from the children\'s fantasy novel series Redwall. This refers to the fact that a complicated riddled path was devised in the series that would lead to the sword, which is similar to the process of debugging, as it involves following clues to achieve an answer. But apart from that, they are entirely different. This is pointed out by White Hat who states that at some point in the process he switched from the puzzle of debugging to the Redwall puzzle of finding Martin\'s sword... Redwall has been referenced before, most prominently in 370: Redwall; where Martin and the sword can be seen; but also in 1286: Encryptic and more recently in 1688: Map Age Guide.\nGoogling an error message is a common method used during debugging, often leading to useful information. However, when there are no search results for a given message, it means the problem is so obscure that almost nobody had experienced it before. (See also 979: Wisdom of the Ancients about getting only one result.) Or, as the title text hints, it might mean it was a hidden clue to the location of Martin\xe2\x80\x99s sword.\n\n
