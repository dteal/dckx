n\nMacGyver was a 80s and early 90s TV character, famed for improvising complex devices in a matter of minutes in order to escape dangerous situations. In this comic MacGyver suggests an unusually direct plan\xe2\x80\x94shooting the guard in the head. However, he still manages to describe his plan in a rather \'complex\' manner.\nIt is worth noting that in the show, MacGyver was adamantly against the use of guns and never used one (at least, not for its intended purpose) in the entire run of the series.\nThe Wikipedia page referenced by the title text redirects to the main MacGyver entry since September 2012. The Wikipedia page can still be found in history, and the content has been moved to MacGyver wikia and expanded.\n\n
