n\nThis is the second part of five in the "1337" series. The title 1337 is "L-eet", or "elite", using the Leet alphabet.\nAll comics in the series:\n\n341: 1337: Part 1\n342: 1337: Part 2\n343: 1337: Part 3\n344: 1337: Part 4\n345: 1337: Part 5\n\nThis series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.\nThe comic is narrated by Cueball as seen in the previous comic, but that Cueball is not shown here, where the man drawn as Cueball is a real person:\nAdrian Lamo is a hacker known for being a threat analyst and has penetrated many corporate networks. As far as we know, he has not penetrated any government networks, so helping Elaine physically break into the NSA would probably inspire second thoughts. The use of a rug to cross the barbed wire fence is likely a reference to a scene in Fight Club, where the same method is used to break into a liposuction clinic.\nRSA is an encryption algorithm that allows decryption using public keys. No efficient method to break RSA is known. But if the NSA knew any such method, it would be unlikely for them to admit that.\nHowever, the NSA have paid RSA to put a backdoor into one of their encryption schemes.\nLawrence Lessig is a political activist focusing on copyright law and intellectual property, as well as a founding board member of Creative Commons.\nSteve Jobs was the two-time CEO of Apple Inc. In partnership with Steve Wozniak he founded Apple. He oversaw Apple\'s return from near bankruptcy, the introduction of the original Macintosh, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. But in the 90s, most of this had not happened yet. The comic is implying that it was Elaine, in fact, who planted those ideas in Jobs\' mind (while perching on his bedpost, a nearly-impossible physical task for even a relatively small and light human being - such a stance is often depicted for gargoyles or fictional vampires, the latter of which are associated with nocturnal bedroom-invasions like this).\nThe final panel is a pun on the Riot grrrls - from Wikipedia Riot grrrl is an underground feminist punk rock movement. This metamorphosis in the hands of Randall into Riot Prrl - who presumably prefer to code in Perl. The real Riot Prrl are from Northampton and are into guerilla knitting.\nThe title text may refer to the urban legend that leads petty criminals to ask each other "Are you a cop?" the bottom line being that liars can lie about whether they\'re lying.\n\n
