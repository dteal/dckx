n\nIn the second of the original Star Wars film Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back", just before Han Solo, portrayed by Harrison Ford, is frozen in carbonite, the following conversation occurs:\n\nLeia: I love you.\nHan: I know.\n\nThe original script had Han Solo respond with "I love you, too", but Harrison Ford felt that the character would not give such a cliched response, even in the face of likely death and ad-libbed the "I know" line that was actually used in the finished film. The ad-libbed line is generally thought to be better than the original would have been.\nThe comic presents several alternative ad-libs that Ford could have made in that conversation as well as at various points throughout the original trilogy. So in this situation it is the actor Ford and not Han Solo that speaks the lines. \n\n\n\n Row\n\n Col\n\n Ad-Lib\n\n Further Detail\n\n\n 1\n\n 1\n\n Well, duh.\n\n Here, Han ruins the mood [a dramatic confession] with a flippant statement.\n\n\n 1\n\n 2\n\n Seriously? ...Christ.\n\n Another example of an out-of-tone ad-lib. The original line is "never tell me the odds", a nod to Solo\'s daredevil persona. In this ad-lib, however, he is hesitant to try anything dangerous.\n\n\n 1\n\n 3\n\n Oh! Hey, that explains the kissing earlier.\n\n Another absurd, out-of-character answer to a serious remark, this time with Solo acting romantically oblivious [rather than forward, as he is usually].\n\n\n 2\n\n 1\n\n I\'m nailing your brother.\n\n So far Leia doesn\'t know she has a brother (Luke). Also, since to nail means to penetrate, she may be surprised to learn that Han is currently engaged in a same-sex relationship (or at least an ongoing arrangement). This panel is referenced in the title text.\n\n\n 2\n\n 2\n\n Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for scissors, though they do beat paper and rock.\n\n The original line is "Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid", a reference to Luke\'s force training and lightsaber use. In this ad-lib, Han turns a discussion about weapons into a [unusually formal] discussion about the game Rock-paper-scissors.\n\n\n 2\n\n 3\n\n Cool. Listen, this thing is really, REALLY cold.\n\n Han is in a freezing chamber in this scene. This remark indicates that he is not very interested in Leia\'s feeling at this moment since he is so cold.\n\n\n 3\n\n 1\n\n Wowzers\n\n Wowzers is an expression used by Inspector Gadget; another amusingly out-of-character ad-lib.\n\n\n 3\n\n 2\n\n Barely. They\'re pretty drunk.\n\n The original response here is "Uh, my team\'s ready. I don\'t have a command crew for the shuttle." In this ad-lib, Han responds to a serious situation [preparations for an important mission to bring down the Galactic Empire] with an unserious response and an admission that he\'s allowing his crew to drink while on duty.\n\n\n 3\n\n 3\n\n Man, me too but Chewie never seems interested. Maybe I should grow my hair out.\n\n The original response was "I can arrange that!  You could use a good kiss!"  In the original film, Leia\'s remark "I\'d just as soon kiss a wookiee" is meant as an insult to Han, implying that he\'s no more attractive than a great hairy monster. In this ad-lib, though, Han takes her statement literally, and suggests that he is also interested in kissing a wookiee. Chewbacca is Han\'s wookiee copilot and fellow smuggler. Han\'s suggestion that he\'s interested in kissing Chewbacca is unexpected on many levels: firstly, Han\'s shown interest in Leia, secondly, Chewbacca is an entirely different species, and thirdly, Chewbacca is also male, and Han Solo is presumed by Leia to be straight.\n\nNote: although it\'s spelled "wookie" in the comic, the canonical spelling of Chewbacca\'s species is "Wookiee".\nThe title text continues the ad lib in panel four. It refers to the plot twist that Luke Skywalker is princess Leia\'s brother, which would not be revealed until the next film in the series. How Harrison Ford knows this twist at this point in the story is unknown.\n\n
