n\nThis comic references a famous quote made by Archimedes: \xce\xb4\xe1\xbf\xb6\xcf\x82 \xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xce\xb9 \xcf\x80\xe1\xbe\xb6 \xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xe1\xbf\xb6 \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb0\xce\xbd \xce\xb3\xe1\xbe\xb6\xce\xbd \xce\xba\xce\xb9\xce\xbd\xce\xac\xcf\x83\xcf\x89, which could translate as "Give me a long enough lever and a place to rest it, and I will move the Earth". Here, Cueball starts off the quote, but then he turns this into a hostage situation, announcing to kill a hostage every hour until he gets the equipment he is asking for.\nThe title text references another famous proverb, "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." The quote starts out the same, but again ends with a sentence that is more fitting for an action thriller.\n\n
