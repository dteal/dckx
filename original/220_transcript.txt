n\nIn all of philosophy, perhaps the most important question considers the meaning of life, and can be expressed as "Why are we here?" or "What does it all mean?" Many philosophers and theologians have attempted to answer the question over the course of human history and every religion claims to have some sort of answer.\nMegan has been considering that the question is essentially meaningless. However, if that is true, she can\'t understand why it continues to be in her thoughts. This might feel frustrating for Megan. Her friends (both looking like Cueball) notice that she is seemingly stuck in this existential question and have a short-term solution for her. One friend reaches for a Super Soaker 50, a powerful toy squirt gun, which he intends to use to spray water at Megan while she is having her existential crisis. (Megan uses this soaker later against Cueball in 517: Marshmallow Gun and later yet, in 625: Collections, she has another one of her crises.)\nThe title text refers to the operant conditioning technique (a form of behavioral modification) commonly used with house cats. If they start scratching the furniture, many people spray them with a squirt bottle (since they hate water) to discourage that behavior (though it seldom works).  It may also allude to the idea of hitting a break key where a program is stuck in a logical loop.\n\n
