n\nThe early comics sometimes do not present a particular point, but are just pictures drawn by Randall.\nThe Little Prince (in French Le Petit Prince) is a novella written by Antoine de Saint-Exup\xc3\xa9ry in 1943, about the titular Little Prince, who lives on an asteroid and visits other inhabited asteroids and eventually the Earth. The book is filled with drawings of the asteroid, the prince, and the travels they make. It is noted how, on occasion, baobab trees can begin to grow on these asteroids, and should they not be immediately uprooted, the growth of their roots would tear the asteroid apart. In this drawing, the roots are encircling the sphere, rather than piercing it, as Le Petit Prince describes.\nThe Little Prince has later been referenced both in 618: Asteroid and in 1350: Lorenz at the end of the space trip branch.\n\n
