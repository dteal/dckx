n\nMegan is sitting at her computer, not waiting for a particular mail, but still refreshing every few seconds. This is an illustration of boredom and pointlessness in life. But suddenly the wall in front of her is opening. She considers running for the door, but curiosity overtakes her, she enters the hole, and with that she enters a different world. The hole appears as if it is a rip in a sheet of paper, implying that since they are drawings, (which they are), that this would be essentially a hole in space-time from their perspective. Most people would run away from such a thing, but Megan seems to feel that since she is currently bored, (shown by the fact that she is constantly refreshing her E-mail) that this is a break from her normal life, and she may not fully be realizing/acknowledging the inherent dangers of leaving her realm into an unknown universe.\nThis starts out a metaphoric five-part adventure, which celebrates, marvels at, and reminds of human freedom. The series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday).\nAll parts of "Choices":\n\n264: Choices: Part 1\n265: Choices: Part 2\n266: Choices: Part 3\n267: Choices: Part 4\n268: Choices: Part 5\n\n
