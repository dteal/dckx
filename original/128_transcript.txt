n\nAnother one of the math-love relationship comics, a mathematical depiction of pain as a differential equation is shown. It is hoped that dPain/dt, or the rate of pain (in this case, shrinking), decreases quickly so that the pain will vanish quickly. He\'s hoping the value for d will not be larger than a few days or some weeks. Assuming that How much she\'s still in my life is a constant G then solving the differential equation leads to the following solution (with unknown c1):\n\n P(t) = c1*(ek2/d+et/d)-d*k1+G/k1\n\nIf k1 was positive or if k2 was a large value, the value of dPain/dt would approach zero. Ideally, k1 would be "How much she\'s in my life"/Pain (we assume both these values are positive), while k2 would ideally be extremely large. Either of these scenarios approach what would be a situation where the value of dPain/dt is close to zero. But we don\'t know the meaning of k1 or k2, these variables are just unpredictable.\nAt the title text Randall changes the famous "laugh to keep from crying" statement to Math.\n\n
