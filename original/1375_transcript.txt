n\nSigns like this normally show the distance to places on earth\'s surface. This sign also has an arrow pointing away from earth and towards "space", with a distance of 62&#160;miles (100&#160;km), due to "astronaut vandalism".\nWe think of Space as being so very far away. This comic puts into perspective that it\'s really a lot closer to get to Space than to many destinations we\'re used to getting to by car or airplane. We think of 62&#160;miles as being an easy trip on the ground, but that same 62&#160;miles is incredibly hard when going vertically, against the force of gravity. Distance-wise, however, it\'s the same.\nThe title text states that the distance to "space" was changed later from 62&#160;miles (100&#160;km) to 50&#160;miles (80&#160;km) by retired Air Force pilots. This indicates that the pilots wanted to reduce the altitude considered to be "space", so that their own high altitude flights could be considered space flights.\nThe USAF and other military branches will award astronaut wings to rated astronauts who fly higher than 100&#160;kilometers (62&#160;miles). The 100-kilometer barrier known as the K\xc3\xa1rm\xc3\xa1n line was designated as the official boundary between the Earth\'s atmosphere and outer space by the F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration A\xc3\xa9ronautique Internationale (FAI) in the mid-1950s. Notwithstanding this definition, some test pilots in the 1960s received astronaut wings by the USAF for their greater-than-50&#160;mi (80.5&#160;kilometers) flights on the X-15.\nThis comic thus both points out that the limit where space starts is arbitrarily chosen and also that space is often much closer than for instance the two largest cities in some randomly chosen location in the US. One possible location is Grenada, MS, which is about 100&#160;miles from Memphis, TN and about 114&#160;miles from Jackson, MS. Conversely it could mean Jackson, TN in which case Tupelo, MS or Kenneth, MO are both viable cities where the post is located.\n\n
