n\nMegan and two Cueball like guys discuss how irrational society\'s interactions about sex are. They decide to throw out all these silly societal rules to end drama forever and spread this philosophy to everyone they know, which immediately leads to a huge increase in drama as shown in the chart.\nAs one of the Cueballs in the comic states, people are indeed complicated and\xe2\x80\x94crucially\xe2\x80\x94what seems intuitive and rational to one person might seem completely irrational to someone else; so throwing out all the rules one person thinks make no sense isn\'t going to mean the world suddenly makes sense for everyone else. Instead, everyone who understands the old rules, whether they like them or not, will suddenly find themselves in a completely alien world to which they have no idea how to relate.\nFurthermore, any one person\'s sense of what seems rational is based on incomplete information. The three people are trying to change all the sex rules\xe2\x80\x94like the engineers referenced in the title text who think they can "solve" the stock market\xe2\x80\x94can\'t even begin to conceive of all the chaotic factors affecting the system they\'re trying to fix, so they have no way of knowing which rules are truly rational and which aren\'t. (See the title text in comic form in 1570: Engineer Syllogism.)\nGeeks often fall prey to the fallacy that human interactions can be easily simplified if only a group of sufficiently qualified geeks put their minds to it as laid out in The Geek Social Fallacies and The Geek Social Fallacies of Sex.\n\n
