n\nTwo guys are trash-talking each other with homophobic comments and your mom jokes. It goes somewhat astray and becomes awkward when the first guy makes a pass at the second guy and is rejected.\nPart of the element of the humor in this comic stems from the common assertion that the most-homophobic of men are the most likely to be a closeted homosexual. Another element is the incredible awkwardness of the end conversation.\nFag, ass pirate, fudge packer, and cock jockey are all insults for a homosexual man. Cum dumpster can apply to both men and women (usually conveying sluttiness).\nRandall\'s title text, that he mock-held this conversation with a friend in a TGIF restaurant indicates how awkward this would be in real life. Even the waitress, a bystander, is put off by it.\n\n
