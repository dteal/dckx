n\nThis comic is a reference to the six-word short story For sale: baby shoes, never worn, which has been commonly attributed to famous author Ernest Hemingway; however, Randall Munroe explicitly states that this might not be the case at all. Whether Hemingway once wrote this story and called it his best work is a matter of urban legend.\nThe comic plays on the fact that the original story takes the form of a short advertisement that might have been seen in a newspaper, and makes up alternate versions that use various modern \'standards\' that did not exist in Hemingway\'s time. In keeping with the original, each example remains six words long. The title text obeys this rule, too. Many of the drafts poke fun at the tragedy that the original story suggests. With the original ("For Sale: Baby shoes, never worn"), readers could infer that the baby who would have worn the shoes must have died. Randall tries to make the reader infer other, more absurd things instead.\nThe comic also alludes to Hemingway\'s practice of repeatedly re-working drafts of his novels before publication. For example, he is reported to have rewritten the final passage of A Farewell To Arms 39 times. Later editions of his works include these rough drafts, allowing the devoted reader to understand how the work developed.\nThe following are the various drafts offered in the comic.\n\n\n\n\n Draft\n\n Explanation\n\n\n For Sale: This gullible baby\'s shoes\n\n This suggests the seller somehow tricked the baby out of its shoes.\n\n\n Baby shoes for sale by owner\n\n This suggests that a very intelligent baby is somehow selling its own shoes, or that someone is selling an old pair of shoes they had as a baby. This style represents the typical automobile or house sales ads, differentiating the sale by owner from the sale by a professional middleman (a car dealer or a realtor) and thus bypassing the extra expense of middleman\'s fee.\n\n\n Actually, there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence Hemingway wrote\n\n A fragment of a preemptive rebuttal to the comic\xe2\x80\x99s premise (or at least its title). This sentence was stopped at the sixth word, in keeping with the premise. Or it might suggest that Hemingway wasn\'t a writer at all, since the line on its own can express a valid sentence.\n\n\n Free shoes, provided you overpower baby\n\n This suggests the person posting the ad is asking people to forcibly steal shoes from a baby. This alludes to the common expression "like taking candy from a baby", meaning a task is extremely simple and effortless. One doesn\'t necessarily need to overpower a baby to steal its shoes either; there are other methods such as annoying the baby until it throws its shoes or tricking the baby (see the first example above).\n\n\n For Sale: Weird baby\'s toe shoes\n\n Randall once again displays his distaste for weird toe shoes, that is, shoes with individual toes.  Rather than the tragedy implied by the original story, this instead implies that someone bought a pair of shoes for the baby that were entirely unwanted.\n\n\n For Sale: Baby shoes
