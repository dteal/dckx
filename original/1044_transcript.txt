n\nThis comic satirizes "either/or" quizzes seen on websites such as mentalfloss.com. These quizzes normally have an element of challenge by presenting tonally similar quotes, such as "Who Said It: Ted Nugent or Cartman from South Park?". The two people are generally chosen carefully to fulfill a particular role, for example:\n\nPolar opposites - Republican vs Democrat, Pro-Life vs Pro-Choice, Christian vs Atheist\nReal vs fictional\nPolitician/Celebrity vs villain - George Bush vs Hitler, Nigel Farage vs Ku Klux Klan, Obama vs Lucifer\n\nIn each case the idea is usually to surprise the reader with the fact that the quotes are difficult to tell apart, with the implied "conclusion" that person A is essentially indistinguishable from person B. In some cases the quizzes may be used as a tool to portray a particular person or group in a certain way, or alternatively may be light-hearted jest.\nMitt Romney was the Republican candidate for President of the United States (officially declared presumptive nominee on April 25, 2012, one week after this comic) during the 2012 US presidential election and, as it says above, the former Governor of Massachusetts. During the election, Mad Magazine published a popular article which compared quotes from Romney with quotes from the Simpsons villain Montgomery Burns. In this comic, Burns is substituted with Charlie Bucket, the main character of the 1964 Roald Dahl children\'s novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, adapted to film in 1971 as Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory. \nThe joke here is that the two categories of quotes are not at all similar, and thus are very easy to attribute. Where the question "Is there even a difference?" usually implies some kind of political satire, in this case the point of the quiz appears to be lost, leading to a situation of bewilderment for the reader.\nIn 1965, Congress created Medicare under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to people age 65 and older, regardless of income or medical history. So, the quote being used in a movie in 1971 (which is obviously not true) is still feasible.\n\n
