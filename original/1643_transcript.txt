n\nCueball is being asked by a friend for the temperature. While he is checking his smartphone for the weather, he begins pondering what unit he should use when answering the question. (See below for Cueball\'s reasoning).\nIn the US (where Cueball and Randall are from), the temperature scale used in daily life is Fahrenheit.  However, Celsius is commonly used for science, even in the US.  Most of the rest of the world also uses Celsius in daily life.\n\nThe Celsius scale is from the metric system. Though this system has been officially sanctioned for use in the US since 1866, it is not frequently used in daily American life, although it is the preferred system for trade and commerce according to the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. The US remains the only industrialized country that has not adopted the metric system as its official system of measurement. The unit degree Celsius or \xc2\xb0C is an accepted derived unit from the International System of Units (SI units) used in science (which again is the modern form of the metric system). The SI unit of temperature is the Kelvin, but this temperature scale is linearly related to the Celsius scale, which is why Celsius can be derived from it.\nThe Fahrenheit scale is from the US Customary system, also known internationally as the (British) Imperial system. The unit is degree Fahrenheit or \xc2\xb0F, and the relation to the Celsius scale is not easy to find in a mental calculation. The relations are: [\xc2\xb0F] = [\xc2\xb0C]*9\xe2\x81\x845 + 32 or [\xc2\xb0C] = ([\xc2\xb0F] \xe2\x88\x92 32)\xc3\x975\xe2\x81\x849. (For this exact reason Randall has previously made a helpful table for these situations in 526: Converting to Metric).\n\nCueball weighs up the benefits of both scales, but fails to find a solution he can live with, and since he feels he has to give his friend an answer now, he panics and gives the answer 0.173 radians.\n\nRadian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. An angle\'s measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle. It has no units and is denoted with the superscript c, but more commonly rad, lest it be confused with angular degrees.\nAngular degrees is a system used to measure angles in geometry, and although it used the unit \xc2\xb0 it has nothing to do with temperature gradations of whichever scale. \n\nThus, this answer is unhelpful and the joke is that traditionally both geometrical angles and temperature is measured in degrees, but there is not the slightest degree of correlation between the two.\nThe title text indicates that Cueball\'s friend still wants to know whether the answer is in radians Fahrenheit or radians Celsius, which, despite being a silly way to express temperature would actually enable the friend to get some meaning out of the reply. But this just takes Cueball back to the problem he failed to solve in the first place of choosing one scale above the other, so suddenly he has to go, and he runs off without ever clarifying what he meant. This result is probably because he is afraid of being a bad friend according to his very last point regarding Fahrenheit: Valuing unit standardization over being helpful possibly makes me a bad friend.\nThe answer Cueball gives of 0.173 radians corresponds to a geometric angle 9.91\xc2\xb0 (0.173 \xc3\x97 360\xc2\xb0/2\xcf\x80). If this were "radians Celsius" it would be 9.91&#160;\xc2\xb0C corresponding to 49.8&#160;\xc2\xb0F and if it were "radians Fahrenheit" it would be 9.91&#160;\xc2\xb0F corresponding to -12.3&#160;\xc2\xb0C. Given the temperatures in Massachusetts (where Randall lives) when this comic came out, the day after Valentine\'s Day 2016, Cueball was probably giving his answer in radians Fahrenheit.\n\n
