n\nThis is a drawing of flowers that Randall made. It seems the flowers are based on his imagination, rather than being a real species - see the original quote in the trivia section.\nThe title text explains that Randall originally drew the flowers in pencil on normal paper. He thus did not paint them. Instead he used the invert feature of a photo-editing program to reverse it from black-on-white to white-on-black. After that he added color to the flowers.\n\n
