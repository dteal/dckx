n\nIt is very common that online input forms demand that one\'s email address is typed twice, and also quite common that pasting into the second field is disabled, so that there is no escape. If a form asks for some information that is really much more crucial, and this standard routine thoughtlessly isn\'t used for those fields too, it would comically seem that the form-makers consider your email address to be hideously important. In the comic, the impression is that it is less important that the wrong city is not accidentally wiped out, than that the boss  knows who to blame afterwards.\nThe title text suggests a real world parallel to this. Randall has heard about differing priorities of identifying who is purchasing a firearm (the state/locality requires one form of identification) and ensuring the payment (the store requires two forms of ID, to properly document the person, in case the check is fake or is rejected by the bank). The point is that people often care a lot about money, but a gun in the wrong hands is a potential disaster bigger than a few hundred missing dollars.\nThis is the only comic so far to feature Green Hat. It appears that the green hat means that he is part of the military.\n\n
