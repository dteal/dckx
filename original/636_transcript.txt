n\nMegan describes her relationship to Cueball with the simile "our love is like a turtle," a comparison often made when referring to a shy and slowly developing yet steady sort of romance. However, Cueball thinks the Brontosaurus is a better comparison. His explanation refers to the fact that remains of Apatosaurus were by mistake believed to be a different species which the paleontologist O.C. Marsh named Brontosaurus. It was later discovered that the two species should be classified as one, with the older name prevailing according to convention [1]. The term Brontosaurus is therefore a scientific redundancy.\nApplied to the scenario in the comic, Cueball apparently considers the relationship without any emotional foundation and only continues it out of nostalgic motives. This conclusion counteracts the initial romantic tone adopted by the turtle simile, as comparing a romance with a falsely classified fossil is one of the least charming statements imaginable.\nThe title text aims at Randall\'s well-known enthusiasm for Velociraptors. Megan retorts by comparing any future sex between the two of them to be as likely as finding a velociraptor in his house. The insult has a second barb: painting Cueball as being obsessed with pornography.\nRandall has previously mentioned the Brontosaurus name change in 460: Paleontology. The Apatosaurus also appears in 15: Just Alerting You and 650: Nowhere.\n\n
