n\nA guy asks his friend to go with him to view the sunrise over the ocean. The friend refuses by giving a list of excuses including the statement that "rationalizing the familiar is easy." This statement is amusing because the friend is acknowledging the fact that he is making excuses and seems to refuse going out on the basis that rationalizing going to see the sunrise would require much more effort. This criticizes some people\'s tendency of not trying new things or going out with friends even though one would likely get more fulfillment by doing these things.\nThe computer with the egg-shaped profile looks like an iMac G3, sold from 1998 until 2003. It seems that rationalizing the familiar has made this guy resistant to upgrading his computer long beyond its obsolescence date.\nThe title text indicates Randall\'s frustration with this mentality and his hope that when he wants to make plans with someone they are just as eager.\n\n
