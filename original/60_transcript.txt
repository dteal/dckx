n\nThe third in the "My Hobby" series. The Super Bowl is the championship American football game of the National Football League which is usually played each February, and the final game of the 2006 season, Super Bowl XL, was played on the evening of 2006-02-05, the day before this comic was released.\nAs it is one of the most watched television broadcasts in North America, advertising during the game became increasingly expensive (among the most expensive advertising rates of any broadcast) to the point where corporations would produce their best, most expensive advertisements to air during the game to ensure they would get value out of the expensive spots. The Super Bowl has thus become notorious for the "best" commercials, with some viewers purportedly tuning in strictly to see the commercials rather than the actual football game. News reports the next day often highlight the best and worst Super Bowl commercials, as do websites devoted to Super Bowl commercials.\nRealizing that the Super Bowl is viewed by a large percentage of the population, Randall somewhat tongue-in-cheek states that those people would be quite distracted during that time, and therefore it would be possible to steal cars without fear of being caught. The title text takes this even further, suggesting that the entire Super Bowl was invented strictly for the purpose of being a distraction for car thieves. Naturally, the addition of the ads would make this even more effective, as it would attract even more viewers and simultaneously ensure that they stayed in front of the TV during commercial breaks as well as the game.\nRandall may have chosen to use a car as a reference to the obscene amount of car commercials that play during the super bowl.\nIn a distant future (2015), Randall (or Cueball) spend his time differently during the Super Bowl - see 1480: Super Bowl. (This was the second time that two xkcd comics have shared the exact same name). The year after in 2016 there were also a comic to commemorate Super Bowl: 1640: Super Bowl Context. In between this comic and the one nine years later, there was no other Super Bowl related comics coming out in relation to the Super Bowl final.\n\n
