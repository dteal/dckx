n\nA mnemonic is any trick that makes memorization easier. For memorizing a sequence of names, a common type of mnemonic takes the initials of the sequence and invents another phrase to them. For example, the order of operations goes Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and the traditional mnemonic goes Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. To make them more memorable, mnemonics are usually quite silly and often vulgar. In this comic, Randall invents various scientific mnemonics, some of them as suggested replacements for traditional ones.\nThe category is listed at the top of the box, the members are listed below that. Then there is the traditional mnemonic that children are usually taught in school to help them remember. Below the comic is one or two options for new mnemonics suggested by Randall. The top one is illustrated in the frame.\n\nSI Prefixes are the prefixes for the systems of units from large to small and since there are so many, the mnemonic needs two lines.\nKarl Marx, as visible in the comic, was a German philosopher and economist who, among other things, invented the ideas of socialism and communism. Central to his ideas was the dictatorship of the proletariat, or the working class achieved by an uprising of the lower class, which taken literally could be done using zeppelins.\nMicrosoft\'s Zune was a failed mp3 player that Microsoft brought to market. It never caught on.\n\n\nTaxonomy is the science of identifying and naming species. Katy Perry, portrayed in the panel, is an American pop music singer, whose popular songs are ones like "Fireworks" or "I Kissed A Girl".\n\nIn the geologic periods frame, the illustration is of a month\'s worth of "the pill" a common contraceptive.\n\nIn Resistor Color Codes, Glenn Beck is in the illustration.  Beck is a far-right conservative commentator in the US, who used to have a show on the Fox News Network.\nThe sign Glenn Beck is holding is a reference to 966: Jet Fuel.\nThe prevailing mnemonic for resistor color codes is pretty terrible (and memorable), hence Randall\'s comment "none I care for".\nBe Bold is a Wikipedia credo. Respect Others may be a reference to Assume Good Faith, another Wikipedia philosophy.\n\n\nIn the Planets frame, the illustration is of Mary and Joseph, who in the story of the Birth of Jesus in the Bible, were mother and father to Jesus. However, Mary\'s conception of Jesus was from God and Mary was still considered a virgin. This mnemonic shows Joseph not really believing that story. Ironically the upstairs neighbour could have multiple meanings as you can\'t get more upstairs than heaven and thus God. Given the snarky tone of most xkcd comics take, it is likely a corporeal neighbor that is being suspected, but it is curious that a neighbor of the upstairs variety is specifically referenced especially given the lack of urban density in the time of Christ.\nMost traditional Planets mnemonics include Pluto, which was "officially" considered a planet before 2006.\n\n\nThe Great Lakes mentioned by the title text are Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario\nSailor Moon is a manga series.\nPaddle-to-the-Sea is an illustrated children\'s book by Holling C. Holling about a toy boat\'s journey through the Great Lakes.\n\n\n
