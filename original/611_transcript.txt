n\nThe comic is referring to a phenomenon known as gaping or rubbernecking. The terms are applied to people who stand around as spectators at the site of a disaster. Apparently, many people are attracted to terrible scenes out of a sort of morbid curiosity. While fascinated by the spectacle, most people also feel a sense of shame and guilt at the same time, unsure of whether it is morally wrong to be entertained by other\'s misfortunes.\nThis feeling of conscience is expressed in the comic by Megan, who secretly cherishes hope that a hurricane might strike. Black Hat on the other hand regards these feelings as perfectly natural. In the course of the comic, it becomes clear that he actually enjoys it when other people are hit by tragedies. He reveals that he even actively promotes the tragic fates of others. His being a sadist concurs with the characterisation depicted in other comics. Megan understands that the two of them are in fact leading entirely different conversations, as Black Hat is not in the least able to comprehend her scruples.\nThe title text aims at hurricane enthusiasts in internet forums, who are distracted by their scientific curiosity from the danger a hurricane may present to humans.\n\n
