n\nCueball is mispronouncing the name of the British TV show, that is also currently shown in the US, which is Downton Abbey. Mispronouncing the title as DownTOWN Abbey causes Megan to sigh because it is such a common and stupid mistake (to fans of the show at least). Mispronouncing the title changes the meaning from being about the eponymous Yorkshire Country Estate (pronounced doun-tuhn ab-ee /\xcb\x8cda\xca\x8ant\xc9\x99n \xcb\x88\xc3\xa6bi/) to being about a monastery in the midst of a large city (incorrectly pronounced doun-toun ab-ee /\xcb\x88da\xca\x8an\xcb\x8cta\xca\x8an \xcb\x88\xc3\xa6bi/). In the UK the CBD (Central business district, big middly bit) is simply called the "city centre". \nLMFAO is a ubiquitous group in the US on radio, TV and even strange commercials with rodents riding in cars with their song, Party Rock Anthem. However, this comic is a reference to another one of their songs, "Sexy And I Know It." The relevant lyrics go something like this:\n\nsigh\xe2\x80\xa6 girl look at that body\nsigh\xe2\x80\xa6 girl look at that body\nsigh\xe2\x80\xa6 girl look at that body\nah-ah, I work out!\n\nThe title text is pretty self-explanatory, especially if the person already knows the music.\n\n
