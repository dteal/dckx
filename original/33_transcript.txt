n\nSelf-reference is a situation where something (a comic, a drawing, a musical work, a novel, a mathematical theorem) refers to itself in some manner. This can be a powerful technique in art, music, mathematics and computer science (it is the basis of recursion).\nIn this comic, Cueball promises not to use self-reference for humor, and then realizes after a beat panel that, since this comic is referring to the series of comics he is part of, he is using self-reference, thus breaking his promise.\nWithout the last panel, this comic wouldn\'t be funny, and therefore wouldn\'t break the promise about using self-reference for humor. But with it, and his realization that he is breaking his promise, it does break that promise.\nAnd the title text is just another humorous self-reference.\nSelf-references has been used most famously later in 688: Self-Description, but was already used in 6: Irony and also in other comics.\n\n
