n\nThis comic starts with a line from the song "Folsom Prison Blues" by Johnny Cash. Cash is noted as saying "I sat with my pen in my hand, trying to think up the worst reason a person could have for killing another person, and that\'s what came to mind," which fits pretty well with the personality of Black Hat. Rather than react badly Cueball starts a rhyming-game, which they continue until Black Hat refers to the horrifying My Lai Massacre, which is apparently going too far for Cueball.\nThe title text continues the rhyme, but changes the roles: now the speaker is asking someone else if they shot a man in Reno.\nFirefly was a TV series that aired on Fox during 2002. Its cancellation was a source of much annoyance to its fans, a fact frequently referenced in xkcd.\n\n
