n\nBlack Hat launches into a long description about the relativity of gravity and inertia that presumably will eventually lead to a Yo\' Momma joke along the lines of "she\'s fat and not that attractive", but then gets bored or loses momentum and cuts to the chase.\nA well known joke format goes: "Yo\' momma\'s so fat, when she X, she Y." For example: "Yo\' momma\'s so fat, when she sits around the house, she sits around the house!" Variations play with the format, for example: "Yo\' momma\'s so fat, she fell in the grand Canyon and got stuck!"  A "Yo Mama" joke also appears in comic 681: Gravity Wells to the right of Jupiter.\nThe title text is a play on the law of gravitational attraction, which diminishes as the square of the distance. So if the distance between two objects doubles, the attraction is reduced to a quarter. And if the distance is halved, the attraction quadruples. Black Hat is saying that the attraction goes up as the cube, so if the distance is halved, the attraction increases eight-fold, and decreases eight-fold when the distance doubles. This implies that "your momma is so fat, she breaks the laws of physics (And does so in a way that she isn\'t as attractive as physics would dictate given enough distance)". \nPlease note: Contrary to Black Hat\'s explanation and as per Albert Einstein\'s theory of general relativity, the reason that objects have equal gravitational and inertial mass is that anything with mass or energy causes a warping of space-time that causes all other objects (including such objects that classically shouldn\'t be affected, like photons) to experience the same gravitational acceleration.\n\n
