n\nJeb Corliss is a professional BASE jumper and wingsuit flyer, like in the fourth panel. Corliss has jumped from a lot of different buildings and monuments in the world. Hence, the Corliss Resolution.\nThe Fermi paradox is an astronomical problem that states: "The universe is large enough that many planets should have extraterrestrial intelligent life. Why, then, haven\'t we detected any signs of it?" The paradox has numerous hypothetical solutions \xe2\x80\x94 some say that life is much rarer than we think, and others suggest that civilizations will eventually destroy themselves (as mentioned in the comic).\nRandall proposes another solution to the Fermi paradox: before they can develop space travel and the like, civilizations will inevitably invent an "activity more fun than survival." That is, something fun that\'s also very dangerous, such as flying off a cliff in a wingsuit.\nAs said in the title text, a being that can already fly (hence "avian society") would probably prefer flying around outside over developing the tools needed for space colonization.\nSee 384: The Drake Equation for another comic about intelligent life in the universe.\n\n
