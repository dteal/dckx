n\nThis comic refers to a popular form of bumper sticker which follow the template "my other car is a ____". Sometimes the blank is a fancy car like a Porsche or a Ferrari; sometimes it\'s an even more expensive transportation like "yacht" or "private jet".\nThe premise was to jokingly imply that someone driving in a less fancy vehicle was wealthier than they looked, as they could afford a fancy car (they simply chose to drive the clunker that day). The designer of the first stickers might even have intended them for serious use by wealthy drivers. The form of sticker ultimately became so well known that the phrase entered the pop-culture lexicon.\nDue to their popularity, these stickers also have been parodied in various ways, like the one Randall has invented here. Randall\'s sticker is a more "honest" sticker which admits "this IS my other car"; in other words, this is the nicer of the two cars.\nThis sticker could probably be used on an expensive car to mirror the traditional sticker\'s use on a cheaper car. However, the car in the strip is a Mitsubishi, which is not a particularly expensive brand. Thus it appears Randall is using the sticker for contrasting purposes: while others would drive a modest car but joke that they have a really nice car at home, Randall\'s car is modest and, as he noted in the title text, his other car is much worse than this one.\nIt\'s also possible that this is a play on meta-levels; by definition, the car that you\'re driving can\'t be your other car, as it\'s this car.\n\n
