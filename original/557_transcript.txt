n\nStudents often dream they have assessments they have forgotten about that are due in a very short time period, leaving no time to complete the assignment, and thus filling them with the feeling of impending failure. The panic and helplessness of being unable to complete the work in time only subsides when the dreamer wakes from the nightmare, although sometimes they wake to a reality where there actually is a looming deadline. \nThis comic suggests these dreams continue well after graduation, although there may be a nagging feeling that "I thought I completed everything and graduated".\nThe title text refers to the Green Ranger from the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Or, indeed, any of the many Power Rangers/Super Sentai seasons with a green ranger. Crisco is a brand of vegetable shortening, a fat that is solid at room temperature and frequently used in baking. It has already been referenced as a sexual lubricant twice before in 330: Indecision and in the title text of 414: Mistranslations. The joke is that Randall has a very odd recurring dream, and wants reassurance that he is not the only one... but he likely is!\n\n
