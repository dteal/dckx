n\nThis comic features Darth Vader, the main antagonist from the original Star Wars trilogy. \nAutoerotic asphyxiation is a sexual practise in which lack of oxygen is induced to enhance sexual stimulus. The technique is considered extremely dangerous, especially without supervision, as loss of consciousness can result in continued strangling which can quickly be fatal.\nIn the films, Vader possesses the ability to restrict the airway of an opponent without having to touch them, using only the so-called "force". This practise has therefore been called force-choking. The comic assumes that Vader used this technique against himself, with the help of a mirror, in order to become sexually aroused.\nLord Vader has apparently force-choked himself to the point of unconsciousness (or possibly even death) and is being transported from his house on a stretcher by two Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).\nThe title text is a pun on the term "choking the chicken", a colloquial expression referring to male masturbation. "Force-choking the chicken" might mean a technique of self-gratification by use of the "force" without having to apply one\'s hands.\n\n
