n\nAn anthropomorphic black number 70 sees a package, but it is a bomb that explodes when opened. This blows the number 70 into pieces, but what is left is not as could have been expected the number 7 and the number 0! The number 7 is there but instead of the number 0 there are the number 2 and the number 5.\nThe title text explains that the number has been Blown into prime factors, which for 70 are 2, 5 and 7. Prime numbers are numbers which can not be divided by any number other than itself and 1. Factors of a number are numbers which can be multiplied together to produce that number (and 2*5*7 = 70). 70 has other factors, including 1, 10, 14, 35 and 70, but 2, 5 and 7 are the only factors which are prime. All other factors of 70 (other than 1) can be formed by multiplying two (or three for 70 itself) of the prime factors together.\nThe colors of the numbers also seems to have been blown apart. In the subtractive color model the three primary colors are cyan, magenta and yellow, but when they mix two and two they form red, green and blue. Those are the three colors of the prime factors. When all three primary colors (and thus also when all three combination colors) are mixed the result is black as are the original 70 (according to the official transcript, although it looks dark blue in the drawing). \n\n
