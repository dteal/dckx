n\nSUVs are large personal vehicles with big engines and a huge amount of cargo space, and are notorious gas-guzzlers. The stereotype is that SUV owners drive such massive cars because they\'re compensating for failures in other parts of their lives, and as an example of conspicuous consumption. Upon hearing Cueball call him an asshole for driving an SUV, Beret Guy, not wanting to appear to be such, trades his SUV in at the dealership for a hybrid subcompact.\nHybrid cars are vehicles that are powered by both gasoline and electrical motors, and in some ways they can be more efficient than gasoline-only powered vehicles.  The stereotype is that people drive them so that they can feel superior to others, and that\'s exactly what Megan says, this time, when Beret Guy happens to drives past them again.\nQuite annoyed now, Beret Guy trades in his car again, this time to get a massive construction vehicle and smack them with it. After doing this, he actually does appear quite smug and happy.\nIn the title text we hear some crashing sounds and then we hear a report by an eyewitness to a police officer. Beret Guy apparently used that massive vehicle to smash into a bakery and steal scones, one of Beret Guy\'s beloved bakery products - see  452: Mission and the title text of 1030: Keyed.\nSee also 434: xkcd Goes to the Airport where Beret Guys obsession with bakeries was first mentioned.\n\n
