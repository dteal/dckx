n\n"Your mom" jokes could be considered an example of fraternity humor, and are seen by most adults as being a sign of immaturity, especially when overused. They generally involve the speaker making indelicate references to the mother of the person to whom he is speaking. For examples of "your mom" jokes see Your Mom.  They are a distinct variation from the more traditional "yo momma" jokes (as in, "yo mamma is so fat..." or "yo mamma is so stupid..."), which are merely insulting.\n"That\'s what she said" is a supposedly funny retort to an innocent looking statement, the intent being to recast it in a sexual light. It gained its most recent surge of popularity as Michael Scott\'s catchphrase on the television series The Office. xkcd contains only failed attempts at "that\'s what she said" jokes, such as 436: How it Happened. The phrase is a simplified version of the older, British expression "...said the actress to the bishop". \nWe enter in the middle of a conversation between Cueball and Megan about the status of their relationship. Megan has apparently just said that Cueball turns every conversation into a "your mom" joke and it\'s becoming unbearable. Cueball, somewhat self-destructively, immediately turns that sentence into a "your mom" joke. \nWhen Megan makes it clear that she has had enough and that she is leaving, Cueball, in a heroic effort to make things even worse, can only respond with the "that\'s what she said" joke.  Megan agrees with Cueball that it is exactly what she (Megan) said, and is obviously about to depart his life forever.\nThe title text stretches the joke further, Cueball suggesting that many men have been with her mother, but perhaps as a last resort or under duress. This is, if possible, even more offensive than his previous efforts.\n\n
