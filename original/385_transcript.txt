n\nThe comic reveals discriminative jargon against women when doing tasks such as mathematics. When a guy does something wrong, it\'s his own mistake. When a girl does something wrong, it is taken as a confirmation that girls are inferior.\nThe mathematics displayed is neither semantically nor syntactically correct. To begin with, there should (most likely) be a dx after x2. Now we have an indefinite integral on the left hand side.\nThe answer \xcf\x80 is just nonsensical: What we want is a function, whose derivative is x2. Now, x3/3 satisfies this condition. However, since adding a constant to a function does not change its derivative, the full answer is (any function of the form) x3/3 + C, where C is any fixed number. The "plus a constant"-part is very easy to forget, and might even be omitted by a (sloppy) professional mathematician. So if someone really gave the answer \xcf\x80, "you forgot to add a constant" would be a pretty funny remark, because in one way it\'s true, but on the other hand it wouldn\'t quite be the main thing to worry about. It is especially inane as pi itself is a constant, so pi + C would simplify down to just C.\nIt would also be possible to fix the equation by adding bounds of integration, so that \xcf\x80 becomes the area below a section of the curve x2. That is called a definite integral, and there would be no "+ C". The bounds would have to be somewhat awkward though; if 0 was the lower bound, the cube root of 3\xcf\x80 would have to be the upper.\n\n
