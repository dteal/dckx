n\nThe comic largely references Euler\'s identity. This identity states that e^(i*\xcf\x80) + 1 = 0. Therefore, e^(i*\xcf\x80) = -1.\nThe humor from this comic is because of the seemingly arbitrary relationship between e, \xcf\x80, and the identity of i (the square root of -1). e is the mathematical identity of which the derivative of e^x with respect to x is still e^x, while \xcf\x80 is the relationship between the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter. Taking these two values and applying them to the value of i in such a manner makes it seem counter-intuitive  that it would yield -1 from basic analysis. The above linked Wikipedia page goes into good detail of how to derive this identity, as does this YouTube video.\nThe title text refers to how Euler\'s identity is called upon in complex form (separating real and imaginary numbers): e^(i*x) = cos(x) + i*sin(x).\n\n
