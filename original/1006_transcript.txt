n\nThis comic is basically about a terrible person that Cueball is somehow talking to, possibly at a bar or party as Goatee Guy is carrying a drink.\nThe title of this comic is a play on the phrase "Stranger than Fiction", which means that sometimes real life can lead to some unexpected ups and downs that would not even make sense in a fictional representation in a book or a movie. Goatee Guy\'s life, unfortunately for him, is "Sloppier than Fiction".\nIn the title text, Roger Ebert was a famous American movie critic.\nOh and FYI, if anyone ever says "It wasn\'t technically cheating"... it was cheating.\n\n
