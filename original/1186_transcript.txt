n\nThere is an often repeated legend that according to the laws of aerodynamics, bumblebees cannot fly. No theories of aerodynamics or mechanics have ever claimed such a thing, and the legend likely originates from a mathematical error that appeared in a 1934 book, written by a scientist who acknowledged that the conclusion was probably wrong.\nHere, Randall puts a bumblebee on top of a control column inside of an airplane and let it fly the entire plane because the bumblebee now really can fly. But physicists are still confused and don\'t know how the bees do accomplish this.\nThe strip also creates a fallacy that when experts can\'t explain something, they must not be able to understand it. In this particular case, experts are unable to explain why bees can fly airplanes because they can\'t fly airplanes.\nThis strip could be a reference to Bee Movie, in which the main character, Barry B. Benson, enlists the help of other bees to land a plane with the last reserves of pollen on Earth. The opening quote of the movie repeats the Bumblebee legend, followed by saying, "The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don\'t care what humans think is impossible."\nThe title text mentions that sociologists are also unable to explain why many people repeat this obviously wrong urban legend.\n\n
