n\nTwo Cueball-like guys are preparing to fence. But only the left seems ready. He says "en garde!", hence the title, a fencing call literally meaning "be on your guard" (from French). The call is used to order the participants to take their position, in a similar way to the \xe2\x80\x9con your mark\xe2\x80\x9d command in racing. The other two commands are \xe2\x80\x9c[tireurs, \xc3\xaates-vous] pr\xc3\xaats?\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9c[combatants, are you] ready?\xe2\x80\x9d) and \xe2\x80\x9callez\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cgo\xe2\x80\x9d). The right participant takes this to mean being "guarded" emotionally.\n"What are you thinking?" is a common question used to deepen a conversation, typically between close friends or lovers. The person being asked may take a moment to consider what they are thinking and whether or not it would be appropriate to share with the asker. If the person being asked is emotionally comfortable with the asker, they may answer immediately without fear of judgment or ridicule. Such a level of comfort between two people generally takes a long time to develop. \nAfter the right fencer has explained why he is always "en garde", the left fencer asks if could be a little less so. But the answer is no since the right fencer acknowledges that he has been hurt before, and thus makes it even more difficult for him to let down his guards. Obviously the right fencer has had bad experience from previous relationships, maybe one where he was ridiculed after sharing his immediate thoughts.\nThe title text takes this further with the "touch" call, used to indicate to a participant that they have been "touched" by their opponent\'s blade, and therefore the attacker receives a point. The right participant counters this claim by saying his emotions have "priority" (or right-of-way), implying he was blocking out ("parrying") the touching feelings. Fencing right-of-way rules can make a move invalid when another move has priority, but generally refer to physical actions on the participant\'s part.\n\n
