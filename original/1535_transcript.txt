n\nThe comic shows four similar Euler diagrams, one for each of the first four years of living with a pet. The diagrams depict sets of words which have varying efficacy in actually identifying the pet, and each one shows how the words used by Randall to refer to his pet change year by year and becoming less and less specific as time goes on.\nIn the first year it is dominated by the actual name of the pet or words closely related. For example, a dog named Lassie might be called either "Lassie", "dog", "collie" or "boy/girl".\nMoving on to the second year, these related words like "dog" and "collie" get more abundant while the actual name is seldom used. Phrases such as "good dog" or "here, boy" are likely common. Giving a dog the name "Dog" is so common that there is a trope about that.\nIn the third year, the pet\'s name is no longer used at all and the owner probably uses simple phrases like "come" or "come here" to call the pet, omitting the name.\nThe fourth year entails the use of just any sound, not coherent words. This may be referring to something like baby talk or attempted mimicry of the pet\'s vocalizations.\nThis development can be attributed to the fact that some animals don\'t listen to their own name but rather react to the sound of the voice of their owner. It could also refer to the growing bond between owner and the pet, as well as the effect described in 231: Cat Proximity.\nThe title text suggests that the inevitable result of this continuing pattern is that by the seventh year, Randall will be communicating with the pet in its own language. This might refer to the tendency of some pet owners to mimic or imitate their pets\' vocalizations, as if speaking to them. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as a joke that pets don\'t have proper language and the owner has degenerated into lack on language his/herself as time goes on.\nThe title text and the caption makes it a little difficult to be certain if the comic refers to when you talk about your pet to other people ("my dog is always hungry") or when you call at it, which would be the only time it would make sense to use coherent words in the animals own language - "Woof" = come here.\n\n
