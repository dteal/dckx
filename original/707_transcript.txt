n\n"I\'d tell you, but then I\'d have to kill you" is a flippant response to a question that\'s been around at least since the movie Top Gun, and has entered regular use in the English speaking world, even among people who don\'t know its origin.\nThe Cueball uses the line here, but the joke is that he actually is planning to kill the other one, and if he answered the question he\'d have to kill him even sooner. \nAccording to the title text, he\'d go from #49 on his hit list (which apparently includes the entire world population) to #31.\nThe title \'Joshing\' refers to the colloquial American verb \'to josh\', meaning to joke with.\n\n
