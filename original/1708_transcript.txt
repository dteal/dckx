n\nThis comic plays on the idea that there is little to no consensus in the scientific community with regard to the amount of water a person should drink per day. In the first panel White Hat presents Cueball with an innocent and sensible suggestion (although controversial) that people should drink six glasses of water per day. In the second panel, more characters joins the discussion, an off-panel voice claims the most common misconception of eight glasses a day, a number which is not supported by scientific research. Ponytail again goes two higher with ten highlighting the existence of a wide range of so-called \'optimum\' liquid consumption \'rule-of-thumb\'. Implied here is the variety of health-related books, articles, blogs or other literature published that self-proclaims an optimum drinking formula.\nThe first sign of absurdity also arises here in the second panel when Black Hat posits that we need 5 glasses of water every minute. This equates to 7200 glasses of water a day, and using an often cited "standard definition of a glass"[1], [2], [3] being equal to 8 oz (236 ml), Black Hat is suggesting that we should each drink 1.7 cubic meters (1700 liters) of water a day, not only curing dehydration but also causing water intoxication. This is a typical Black Hat kind of statement that he uses to further emphasizes the absurdity of the problem at hand.\nSome time later Megan, despite having read through all studies on dehydration (or low-grade dehydration in particular), still has not come to a solid conclusion. She becomes dizzy, admitting that she\'s been so focused on her work, she has ironically forgotten to eat or drink. Her personal experience with dehydration prompts someone off-panel to get some water, but since she couldn\'t find any consensus in her research, she asks how many glasses they should bring her. Presumably to avoid the question of "how many glasses" entirely, Cueball finally suggests that she should drink straight from the tap, a (tenuously) sincere suggestion seeing her dehydration and following the good advice to drink when you are thirsty until that state has been absolved. In the title text of 1744: Metabolism, released less than 3 months after this one, Cueball mentions how he starts to feel bad if he refrain from drinking, just like Megan here. In that comic it is Cueball that tells White Hat about his "problems".\nThe title text contains a mix-up between two often stated intervals; drinking eight glasses of water per day (which makes no sense, see above) and changing the engine oil every 3000 miles (almost 5000 km) which may be a good rule, but not a necessity. Obviously it\'s impossible to drink 3000 glasses of water, and changing the oil every eight miles (about 13 km) would make driving a car very impractical.\nThe subject of this comic has been graphed in 715: Numbers and mentioned in the what if? Soda Planet:\n\n\nThe question of how much water we should drink per day is the subject of furious debate\xe2\x80\x94the "8 glasses" thing seems to be a myth\xe2\x80\x94but the amount of water we actually drink per day seems to be about a liter.\n\nLater, in the what if? Faucet Power, Randall comments on the preference for even numbers in the graph, and writes:\n\n\nThe only real solid advice I\'ve heard is that if you\'re thirsty, you should drink some water.\n\nHow many glasses is "some water" remains an open question...\nBeret Guy and Megan are participants of a thought experiment concerning glasses of water and vacuum in the what if? Glass Half Empty.\nThis comic is a rare example where a normal few panel comic manages to use five of the seven major characters who actually interact. It is the first comic where Black Hat has spoken (or directly interacted) with White Hat. They have until this comic only appeared together in complicated/large drawings where the two would not need to interact anyway.\n\n
