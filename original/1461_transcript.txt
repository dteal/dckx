n\nThis comic is an infographic representing the launch mass of various spacecraft and artificial satellites, and the low Earth orbit payload capacity of various space launch vehicles. Rather than using standard units of mass such as kilograms or pounds, Randall has assigned values based on the mass of a horse. Based on cross checking researched masses and payloads with the number of horses depicted, it appears that one horse unit is defined as 450&#160;kg (with an average of 432.82&#160;kg), or perhaps 1000&#160;lb. In cases where the mass is less than one horse, an alternative measure of dogs has been used, where one dog appears to be roughly 40&#160;kg (with an average of 48.05&#160;kg, or perhaps 100&#160;lb.). In the case of Vanguard 1, even a dog is too large a measure, so instead the unit squirrel is used to represent its 1.47&#160;kg (3.5&#160;lb.?) mass.\nThe overall comic may be an allusion to horsepower, a similar-sounding but completely different concept. Horsepower is a measurement of power (work per unit time). Another commonly referenced unit for power is the watt. 1&#160;horsepower is meant to be approximately the amount of power a horse can deliver. In contrast, Randall uses the horse to measure mass (of particular spacecraft, and of the maximum payload launch vehicles can carry).\nThe top pane of the comic (black background) shows the mass of various spacecraft, while the bottom (white background) shows the payload capacity (to low Earth orbit) of launch vehicles. Along the bottom of the image is a timeline, relating to the launch date of the entries.\nThere are also several joke insertions:\n\nT-Rex - A dinosaur, but fairly unlikely to be found orbiting Earth.\nPegasus - An actual launch vehicle, but also the name of a mythical flying stallion. The payload is given as "one Pegasus", which comes out to be slightly less than "one horse".\nAtlas-Centaur - Again, an actual launch vehicle, but also a reference to the half-human half-horse creatures of Greek mythology. The payload is given in "centaurs", which come out to be slightly more than "horses".\n1981 Oldsmobile - Not a launch vehicle, but in fact a car. The payload is given as 4 horses, which may relate to the carrying capacity (by weight) of the Oldsmobile, not the ability of an Oldsmobile to launch that payload into low Earth orbit. While there are no known examples of an Oldsmobile reaching low Earth orbit, The Blues Brothers movie shows an Oldsmobile performing a very, very long flight, and this might be the reason why Randall chose this specific car.\n\nThe Pegasus, 1981 Oldsmobile, and Stratolaunch spacecraft are depicted horizontally, because these vehicles launch from a horizontal starting position and use forward momentum to facilitate their launch.\nAn unlabelled launch vehicle is shown below the H-IIA near 2002. From the payload and date it is believed to represent the Delta IV M. Whether its lack of labelling is intended or a mistake is unknown.\nThe title text refers to a favourite subject of Randall\'s - The space elevator. A space elevator is a (currently theoretical) mechanism for travelling into space, consisting of a very long (&gt;35,000&#160;km) cable and counterweight connected to the Earth at the equator. The cable rotates at the same rate as the earth, and thus appears stationary when viewed from earth. It is then possible to climb the cable into space, and even use it as a slingshot to launch vehicles.\nIn the title text, the amount of power required to lift a horse into space has been investigated, with the launch capacity of a backyard solar array and large power station compared. A rudimentary (and possibly incorrect) calculation in the discussion section puts the required power output of the solar array at 315&#160;kW and the power station at 3.3&#160;GW.\n\n
