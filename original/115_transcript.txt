n\nThe situation is a reference to the animal athlete loophole trope, where an animal joins a failing sports team and saves the day. The other team (i.e. the bad guys) does not like it, but since there is not a specific rule against it, it has to be allowed.\nIn this particular situation, Randall uses both an animal (Meerkat) and sport (rugby) that haven\'t been used in an animal sports movie before.\nThe title text mentions an "adorable golden retriever", a direct reference to the most famous animal athlete film Air Bud.\nThis concept was revisited in 1552: Rulebook.\n\n
