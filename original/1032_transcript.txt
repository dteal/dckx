n\nObviously, Beret Guy\'s business plan worked.\nNetworking, in business, is the act of expanding your group of contacts in order to help your career down the line. Here, in this comic, Beret Guy meets Chief Technology Officer (CTO, an executive level position overseeing development of new technologies) Connr Clark (perhaps a typo for "Connor" or perhaps a reference to common "Web 2.0" names like the businesses Flickr, Tumblr, etc.) and Beret Guy is as strange as he usually is: Although he is a business professional he has just photocopied a burrito.  He also has a business card; usually this would contain contact information, but his only says "This is my business card". He calls his briefcase, or suitcase, a "handlebox", and it is full of a quarter of a million dollars in cash. Then Beret Guy proceeds to eat Connr\'s business card. All of these things are not common behavior.&#91;citation needed&#93;\n"Networking" is often an over-hyped, empty affair. There are zillions of networking meetings of every description going on every day everywhere, and mostly people trade cards and continue to not make money. So that\'s the joke \xe2\x80\x93 Beret Guy does the networking schtick, badly, and yet is somehow making huge amounts of money at it.\nThe comic is also likely a joke on the idea that many people are excited about becoming a "business professional" who carries a briefcase, hands out business cards, and makes tons of money, without having an adequate plan for how to make those things happen, or possibly even knowing what their actual job would be. Beret Guy never says what he does, simply introducing himself as a "business professional," and explains his piles of cash with "I am a business grown-up who makes business profits!" In this world \xe2\x80\x94and in people\'s dreams\xe2\x80\x94 when you "grow up" and start a business, money magically appears. Obviously, that\'s not how it works.&#91;citation needed&#93;\nThe title text is a pun on three common business buzzwords: agile, lean and long-tail. An agile business is one that can change course quickly based on customer demands and the business environment. A lean business is one with minimal inventory or assets; nothing is idle or warehoused, so everything in active use or on the move. Long-tail describes the strategy of offering a large number of unique items with relatively small quantities sold of each \xe2\x80\x93 usually in addition to selling fewer popular items in large quantities. Netflix is a popular example of long-tale because they have (almost) every movie imaginable, including rare titles that only a few people would be interested in.\nAnd of course, the pun here is one animal that is agile and lean with a long tail is a polecat.\nFurthermore, although "agile" and "lean" do mean a quick, nimble, and efficient business, they also refer to specific practices, as in agile software development, lean manufacturing and lean Six Sigma. Many people think these terms have devolved to overused jargon. While agile development is supposed to be a highly structured method to get programmers to produce more working code quickly, when someone from the marketing department says "agile" it often means "We don\'t know what we\'re supposed to be producing, so we\'ll just chuck some stuff together, and keep those bits that the customer says he likes. We\'ll then do it all over again until we\'ve got something that he\'ll pay for." "Lean" is supposed to mean that a business keeps its costs as low as possible, employing one person to do marketing and PR, not really having a Human Resources department, etc. But, in practice it often becomes "Keep as little stock as possible so that we don\'t have a lot of money tied up in it, and don\'t need a big warehouse; make stuff just before it is supposed to ship so that we don\'t have to store it either; make frequent prayers and virgin sacrifices to whatever gods we can find to ensure that nothing slips up anywhere along the line that our lawyers can\'t get us out of."\nSee also 1117: My Sky.\n\n
