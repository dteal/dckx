n\nThis comic shows a view that many physics students, upon first encountering a well-known problem, think that it is not a difficult problem, since they think they can fix it using an extremely simplified model. The obvious problem with this is that if it was that simple to solve the problem to a useful degree, there wouldn\'t be an entire department studying the problem. This attitude leads to great annoyance from those who have probably spent years and years working on the problem. This argument is similar to the Spherical cow, an idea that basic models taught in early physics classes only work in friction-less vacuums, as shown in 669: Experiment. The title text takes the dismissive attitude to its logical extreme.\nThe comment "liberal-arts majors can be annoying sometimes" seems to be referencing the stereotype that they\'re all elitist know-it-alls.\n\n
