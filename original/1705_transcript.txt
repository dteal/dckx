n\nPok\xc3\xa9mon GO is an augmented reality (AR) smartphone game, where players walk around the real world trying to find and capture digital first-generation Pok\xc3\xa9mon (i.e. Pok\xc3\xa9mon from the first series of games released), then leveling them up and/or evolving them, and using them in battle, similar to the classic Pok\xc3\xa9mon games for handheld consoles. These Pok\xc3\xa9mon are randomly placed around the world in the AR format so that they can only be seen through the phone. Randall is playing a prank on all players happening upon his real Pok\xc3\xa9mon figures as they are so consumed with this new game that they assume that they are from the game, not realizing that they should not be able to see them before they take out their phones, and then after doing this wondering why their phone is having trouble loading them.\nDue to the popularity of the Pok\xc3\xa9mon franchise, after Pok\xc3\xa9mon GO\'s release in the United States on July 6, 2016, many fans of the series have been walking around with their smartphones out to capture and battle Pok\xc3\xa9mon.  Some players are so eager to capture rare Pok\xc3\xa9mon (for example, Vaporeon) that they will leave their cars amid traffic with the engines running.  [1]\nRandall jokes that he has replicated the AR properties of the Pok\xc3\xa9mon in the app (that is, when you encounter a Pok\xc3\xa9mon, it is a small computer-generated sprite placed over your phone\'s rear camera image that moves about your screen, giving the appearance of a "real" Pok\xc3\xa9mon in front of you). Randall\'s real life plastic models of various Pok\xc3\xa9mon have been constructed so they would seem to fit on a smartphone screen due to perspective, he has embedded a gyroscope in them so they wobble about their base giving them the appearance of basic computer-created movement, and as a final touch he has added a subtle underlighting which is also part of the game, and gives them a slightly computer-generated look compared to the real world around them. These effects combined fool avid Pok\xc3\xa9mon GO players into taking out their smartphone to capture the Pok\xc3\xa9mon for their game, when in fact it is just a toy sitting in front of them, and they should have known this as mentioned above. In this comic Randall displays the Pok\xc3\xa9mon called Squirtle which looks like a little turtle.\nThis comic is part of the My Hobby series. In this case, the hobby is pranking players of Pok\xc3\xa9mon GO by replicating the appearance of the augmented reality mechanic.\nIn the title text, Randall is still waiting for an update that allows capture of strangers\' pets -- besides the obvious, playing by the rules of Pok\xc3\xa9mon only wild (not any with an owner) Pok\xc3\xa9mon can be caught. However, in the Pok\xc3\xa9mon Colosseum games, through the use of a specialized device the player steals from the villains, the player can capture other trainers\' Pok\xc3\xa9mon. This is also a callback to an earlier strip wherein Black Hat wishes for a Pok\xc3\xa9ball that works on strangers\' pets (see last entry in 1086: Eyelash Wish Log).\nIn 1732: Earth Temperature Timeline Pok\xc3\xa9mon are mentioned to be going extinct in 9000 BCE. The phrase is like this: "Last North American Pokemon go extinct", which could be a direct reference to the game and thus this comic. However, Megan stated that this is not a real fact...\n\n
