n\nThe Ring is a horror movie released in 2002 based off the Japanese movie Ringu. In it, there is a video tape that causes everyone who watches it to die after seven days. However, the viewer can prevent their death by making a copy of the tape and giving it to someone else.\nA young boy Cueball watches the tape and prevents his own death by "copying" the tape and uploading it to a video-sharing website, presumably YouTube. Cueball not only got one person to watch it, the requirement for escaping death, but 363,104 people; all of whom are most likely going to die in seven days.\nRickrolling[1] is an Internet meme where someone is lured into clicking on a video link of Rick Astley singing "Never Gonna Give You Up." When someone is Rickrolled, they usually get very upset. Cueball states in the comic that he uploaded the tape to get revenge on everyone who Rickrolled him, though it was obvious that he would likely kill many more people than those who Rickrolled him (or those who\'ve Rickrolled anyone else).\nThe title text refers to the file format used by the YouTube player. Historically, YouTube was famous for having extremely poor quality videos because their Internet connections were slower and server storage space was expensive. So, all videos were transcoded into a very low quality FLV (flash video) format.\nThe girl shown in the video tape \xe2\x80\x94 a major part of The Ring series \xe2\x80\x94 is named Samara. Posting the tape on YouTube would result in heavily compressed videos in the FLV format. This, presumably, would reduce the quality of Samara\'s apparition. The title text also implies that nobody deserves that although Rickrolling is apparently punishable by death.\n\n
