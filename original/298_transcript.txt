n\nCueball diligently creates a Tesla coil, a device that produces high voltage alternating currents. \nAfter that show by Cueball, Black Hat magically shoots electricity from his fingertips. When Cueball asks how he did that, he says that science doesn\'t really work, then hovers in mid-air, further proving his point. There is simply no apparent explanation for Black Hat\'s abilities, which means science is still woefully incomplete or, as Black Hat said, simply doesn\'t work.\nThe title text indicates that this was all actually a dream, explaining Black Hat\'s abilities and pointing out how dreams can be difficult for scientists as they will attempt to analyse and understand everything in the dream according to the laws of science, which wouldn\'t apply in dreams.\n\n
