n\nShootouts were common in many old Western films, most famous on spaghetti Westerns. Commonly, to accentuate the silence and dreariness of the scene before the fight, a tumbleweed would roll past the fighters. In this comic, the two gunmen, as per the cliche, stand quietly. The tumbleweed then rolls past, and pulls a pair of revolvers. It then shoots both of the gunfighters, winning the duel unexpectedly.\nThe title text refers to a common trope in Westerns to have the hero ride (or in this case, the tumbleweed roll) into the sunset at the conclusion of the film. However, given that prevailing winds go from West to East, that means that the tumbleweed would be unable to tumble into the sunset, thus meaning it cannot reenact this trope no matter how hard it tries.\n\n
