n\nSkywriting is using an airplane to write words in the sky with controlled releases of smoke. Unicode is a standard for digitally encoding text which supports a huge variety of characters and modifiers. \nCueball and Megan hired a skywriter to write some text which they provided in Unicode, but now they are dissatisfied with the result and Cueball is using one of their walkie-talkies to tell the pilot about his mistake\xe2\x80\x94with the result that the pilot seems to lose control (presumably control of the plane, not the text).\nAn interrobang (\xe2\x80\xbd) is a combination question mark and exclamation mark. A diacritic is any symbol added to a character (for instance \xc2\xb4, \xcb\x98, \xcb\x87, \xc2\xa8), usually an accent mark added to a letter. In Unicode, combining diacritics are represented as separate characters, but computer programs that render text graphically treat them as modifications to the previous character. The request to modify the interrobang is strange, given that diacritics are supposed to modify letters, not punctuation marks, and given that in interrobang is already conceptually a character combination.\nThe skywriter\'s errors and the phrase "Unicode support" play off the common issue of software rendering Unicode symbols incorrectly. But here the error does not seem to make the text unintelligible: all the skywriter has apparently done is put a diacritic underneath (or perhaps next to) the interrobang instead of above it. If this is the only problem with the text (which is likely, given that an interrobang would probably be at the end), then the comment that the skywriter has "terrible Unicode support" makes Cueball and Megan seem fastidious and unforgiving. The comic points up computer users\' tendency to use hyperbole when describing minor problems, exaggerating their relative seriousness. Here Cueball and Megan seem concerned more about their incorrectly rendered text than about the skywriter\'s safety.\nThe title text refers to the C0 Block, the name for the first 32 character codes in Unicode (and ASCII), traditionally called control characters. Cueball wonders how the plane could possibly have lost "control", when the "control characters" are so clearly in the conventional location.\nComic 1647: Diacritics also references an absurd use of diacritics.\n\n
