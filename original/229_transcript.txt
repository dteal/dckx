n\nThe humor in this comic comes from the irony of a deep philosophical musing on the nature of individuals sharing a private space in a public place, unknown to one another and separated by time. The graffiti text is juxtaposed with more common bathroom stall scrawlings - insults, slurs, and "[Name] was here."\nThis comic makes use of the existential idea of "finding meaning where you look for it", a recurring theme in xkcd. The caption implies that a bathroom stall isn\'t a place where Randall would like to find meaning in life, so he shouldn\'t look for it there.\nThe title text parodies one of the archetypical pieces of graffiti: "For a good time, call [phone number]", which indicates that the person reachable at that number is available for prostitution, casual sex, and/or phone sex. However, \'good\' has been replaced with \'intriguing\' time, implying that instead of sex the writer is offering witty and insightful conversation.\n\n
