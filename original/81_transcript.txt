n\nA stereotypical loudspeaker announcement (often referenced in TV and film) is one in which a store employee (or anyone else in charge somewhere where people gather, like church or a school) announces that a certain colour and model of car has its lights on, or is blocking another car, or is about to be towed. A licence plate is sometimes included for greater clarity.\nThe Dodge Viper SRT-10 was a version of the Dodge Viper available on the third and fourth generations of Viper from 2003-2010. It was a very expensive sports car.\nIn this case, Black Hat is up to his old ways as, in addition to announcing that an SRT-10 has its lights on, he also announces that it has had its windshield smashed with a golf club. He clearly only knows what instrument was used because he is holding the golf club, and presumably was the one who smashed the windshield. Thus, Black Hat is making an announcement which is, ironically, only useful after damage has been done to the car. The lights are probably on because the attack triggered the car\'s alarm system, which usually makes a car\'s lights flash repeatedly and sound either its horn or a programmed alarm sound.\nThe two license plates in the comic are personalized license plates, which are plates with a custom set of characters which you can pay for if you desire. They typically are intended to represent words but often have vowels missing to save characters, or numbers in place of letters. The one in the comic-proper is clearly "My Toy" \xe2\x80\x93 suggesting that the owner was bragging about his car and perhaps that he has lots of money which may have irritated Black Hat; the plate in the title text is most likely "Dad\'s Money", which Randall suggests is a real plate on a car outside his building, suggesting that the driver\'s father paid for the car. Not something the average person would want to brag about, as it seems fairly cocky, and also suggests that the person can\'t afford the car on their own.\n\n
