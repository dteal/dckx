n\nWait Wait... Don\'t Tell Me is an hour-long weekly radio news panel game show produced by Chicago Public Radio and National Public Radio. The show is hosted by playwright and actor Peter Sagal. Each episode ends with the panelists making up a potential future news story, usually with implausible "facts". This comic is making puns on the title of the show based on what Peter Sagal might have done that was newsworthy.\nCarl Kasell, who also served as the news anchor on Morning Edition, was the show\'s official judge and scorekeeper until May 2014 (after this comic was published), when he retired and was replaced by Bill Kurtis.\nThe 1st row, 4th paper may refer to the  Laugh Factory Incident of 2006.\nIn the 3rd row, first paper, Lakshmi Singh is NPR\'s national midday newscaster.\nIn the 3rd row, 3rd paper is a reference to a protest at UC Davis (on the campus of University of California, Davis) protests in early 2012 in which sitting, peaceful protesters were calmly pepper-sprayed in their faces by a police officer. That spawned an internet meme of epic proportions.\nIn the 4th row, 2nd paper is a reference to the movie, Ghostbusters.\nIn the 4th row, 3rd paper is a reference to Granny Weatherwax of Terry Pratchett\'s Discworld novels; Granny Weatherwax is a witch who carries a sign saying "I ATEN\'T DED"(sic) when having out-of-body experiences.\nIn the 5th row, 2nd paper is a reference to another internet meme in where someone leaves out the verb in the sentence. It is based on the I Accidentally ___ meme.\nIn the 5th row, 3rd paper is a reference to the Eldritch abomination Cthulhu, from "The Call of Cthulhu" by H.P. Lovecraft. He is one the Old Ones, the Elder Gods, and is awakened by his worshipers chanting, "Ph\'nglui mglw\'nafh Cthulhu R\'lyeh wgah\'nagl fhtagn" ("In his house at R\'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.") Hence the title, "Wait, Wait, Don\'t speak its name."\nTwo years later another New Years comic, 1311: 2014, took a similar look at what could happen in 2014, just as this does for 2012. Interesting enough the title of that comic (just the year it was looking at) is more related to the title of the next comic after this one, which is also a New Year comic, and the title is also just the number of the year: 998: 2012.\n\n
