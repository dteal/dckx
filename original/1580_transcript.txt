n\nA "ghost" is a common term for the recording of a player\'s best actions in a racing game. The recording is used to create a virtual racer that another player can compete against. The previous player is shown as ghostly and transparent, because it is only a recording of a previous game and it does not interact in any way with the game currently being played. Certain models of cycling also use this concept to motivate athletes while training.\nA mapping app, such as Google Maps, attempts to plot the fastest route from one place to another, but there\'s no way to tell which route is really the fastest without testing it. So, Cueball has created an app that will simulate a number of different routes and produce "ghosts" from them. He hopes to use this app to discover the fastest route by competing against his ghosts like a racing game. He brags about this app to his friend White Hat.\nHowever, the comic takes a turn for the absurd when it depicts actual ghosts competing with him, instead of simulations on his phone.  Soon enough, he is fired from work because one of his "ghosts" is more punctual than he is. And even worse his children apparently comes to prefer the more punctual "ghosts" over him as this version of daddy never misses their games. (The girls could be the same as those in the 1659: Tire Swing).\nIn the title text this is even taken into the bedroom, although it is a different ghost than the one preferred by the children. This is likely a subtle reference to euphemisms for sexual climax, such as "arrival", with delayed ejaculation generally preferred.\nIt should be noted that this app would not guarantee the minimum travel time. The user doesn\'t find out which route was fastest until after the first ghost has arrived. But as the current traffic situation will have changed by then, that route will not necessarily still be the fastest.\n\n
