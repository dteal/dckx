n\nPok\xc3\xa9mon is a popular franchise that includes 5 children\'s animated television shows, a collectible card game, and a whole series of video games. The premise is that a young "trainer" goes out to explore the world and catch Pok\xc3\xa9mon: fanciful wild creatures that come in many varieties, ranging from armoured dinosaurs that have drills for horns to robotic bugs that change their type depending on the items that they are holding. When the trainer comes across wild Pok\xc3\xa9mon or other trainers, they use their Pok\xc3\xa9mon to fight each other.\nIn this comic, Randall claims that "I\'m not really into Pok\xc3\xa9mon" can serve as an all-purpose phrase of condescending dismissal. The implied insult to the thing being dismissed can include:\n\n Childishness. Although it does have a significant adult following, the Pok\xc3\xa9mon franchise was and is mainly targeted at children.\n Frivolousness. The essential goal of Pok\xc3\xa9mon games, summed up in the slogan "Gotta Catch \'Em All", is to catch Pok\xc3\xa9mon for the sake of having them.\n Commercialism. Pok\xc3\xa9mon is a sprawling franchise that periodically releases new iterations, which (at least to a non-fan) can seem much like more of the same, only existing to make money. At present, the Pok\xc3\xa9mon universe contains over 700 different types of Pok\xc3\xa9mon.\n Absurdity. As mentioned, the designs of individual Pok\xc3\xa9mon can be quite fanciful; "absurd" would be a more unkind way to put it.\n\nThe example in the comic is Black Hat dismissing Ubuntu, an open-source computer operating system. Ubuntu may have been particularly chosen as specifically suitable for the "Pok\xc3\xa9mon dismissal" for reasons such as:\n\n The name "Ubuntu", which (like the names of Pok\xc3\xa9mon) can sound strange or silly. Individual Ubuntu releases also have animal-themed names (like "Hoary Hedgehog" and "Saucy Salamander").\n The name "Ubuntu" sounds like a Pokemon region.\n Its release schedule; new Ubuntu releases come out every six months, which might (like Pok\xc3\xa9mon) be unfavourably described as putting out more of the same in new packaging.\n A notion that people try Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions) just for the sake of doing so, like catching all the Pok\xc3\xa9mon.\n\nThe title text refers to the complications that new software releases can have on computers, especially if either the release is an alpha or beta release, or if the computer is rather old. Randall specifically mentions Ubuntu 6.10 and Firefox 2.0, both of which were officially released around two weeks after this comic was posted, so the versions causing problems were certainly pre-release editions. While Randall does not detail any specific issues, the title text may paint a picture of two computer programs fighting each other inside the computer and making a mess in the process, as if they were Pok\xc3\xa9mon.\n\n
