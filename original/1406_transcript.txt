n\nConverter boxes are used to connect two or more devices together which otherwise couldn\'t be, due to differently shaped plugs, different voltages, or different protocols of communication.\nConverter boxes or converter cables are commonly found for several of the plugs at the top of the list - such as from USB to micro-USB. As this is supposed to be a Universal Converter Box, there are many connections.\nThe humour from this comic comes from the sheer number of different standards that all claim to be the universal way to connect two devices, in their target market, as well as the progressively ridiculous conversions that this box is capable of doing, for example, converting audio from a 1/8&#160;inch / 3.5&#160;mm headphone jack, into a variety of fuel suitable for running your car.\nA connector is capable of making a connection to another connector only if the connectors are of the same style and the opposite gender ("male" connector is plug, "female" connector is socket), except for rare "genderless" connectors, such as the token ring mentioned above. Gender changers are devices with two connectors of the same gender. The "circular center pin DC adapter tips" in the title text are barrel jack power plugs. There are a large number of these style connectors, and many of these devices look the same. This leads to frustration\n\n
