n\nIn the Pok\xc3\xa9mon franchise, human characters called Trainers capture fantastical creatures from the wild, the titular Pok\xc3\xa9mon (a shortened form of "Pocket Monsters"), and train them to battle one another. Pok\xc3\xa9mon are captured and stored in devices called Pok\xc3\xa9 Balls, which shrink the creatures down to pocket size (hence "Pocket Monsters"). The anime\'s English dub has enshrined the phrase "&lt;Pok\xc3\xa9mon\'s name&gt;, I choose you!" into popular culture memory. When Trainers do battle, they often shout this phrase while throwing the ball to the ground, releasing the Pok\xc3\xa9mon at full size.\nIn this comic, a Pok\xc3\xa9mon chosen at some point was a Pikachu (the "poster child" for Pok\xc3\xa9mon, and the most publicly-known type), which does not intend to engage in the battle himself. Instead, the Pikachu chooses another Pikachu to fight for him. This process then repeats itself. Behind the Pikachu with the Pok\xc3\xa9ball is a long line of other Pikachu, suggesting that this process has been going on for a while.\nNearby stands Cueball, holding a closed Pok\xc3\xa9ball, and Megan, looking at her watch. This suggests that Cueball intends to have his own Pok\xc3\xa9mon fight the Pikachu, but is waiting to see which enemy his Pok\xc3\xa9mon must face before the battle can actually begin (waiting in vain, if the above described process repeats indefinitely), while Megan is growing impatient with the delay. Given that Cueball is holding a closed Pok\xc3\xa9ball he has not deployed yet, Megan cannot herself be his Pok\xc3\xa9mon. She could be his opponent, or a spectator.\nThe joke in this comic comes from analogy with the mathematical proof by induction, which is a proof about a base case, followed by a never ending sequence of steps, each step leading to the next. Induction proves an assertion is true for one case, and then infers that it must also be true for all related cases. The title suggests that the process of Pikachu choosing Pikachu will never end, effectively postponing the battle indefinitely. But the title is win by induction, by which Randall implies that we have been given enough information to reason logically whether Megan or Cueball will win. We have here turned mathematical induction on its head: part of the humour in the comic is that the logic of induction doesn\'t work in reverse. We cannot reason about an initial case by inferring something from a related case whose proof is dependent on knowledge about the initial case. Or perhaps the "win" referred to is precisely that the battle is indefinitely postponed.\nThe name "induction" comes from logic and discrete mathematics, and is thus unrelated to the physical phenomena of electromagnetic induction; but the fact that Pikachu is an "Electric-type" Pok\xc3\xa9mon could be a word play connecting the two ideas.\nIf there were always only a single Pikachu in each Pok\xc3\xa9ball, this would spawn an unlimited number of Pikachu growing at a constant rate. Since, as the title text notes, there are occasionally two of them in a Pok\xc3\xa9ball, this would lead to exponential growth assuming each of the spawned Pikachu in this case is bearing a Pok\xc3\xa9ball!\nPikachu was used in one of the storylines of 1350: Lorenz.
