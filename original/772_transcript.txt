n\nFrogger is a classic video game introduced in 1981. The aim of the game is to safely get a frog across a busy road and a river to a lily pad at the top of the screen. \nThe title text reveals that a team of programmers misinterpreted a task to make the game "more realistic", i.e. better graphic, and instead made the trucks swerve to avoid the car-sized frog, causing a car to crash into the truck resulting in a serious car crash, instead of the cars just continuing to move at a constant rate in straight lines disregarding the movements of the frog.\nThe game continues to introduce increasing drama with the off-panel bystanders.\nThis is similar to the idea behind the modification of the game in 873: FPS Mod, which also turns the played from a violent game.\nPerhaps Randall was inspired by this Robot Chicken sketch.\n\n
