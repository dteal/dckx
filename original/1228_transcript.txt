n\nThis comic is about copyright and patent, which are temporary government-granted monopolies for authors and inventors. It refers to the cultural hero Prometheus in Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity. In this case, Prometheus claims that it is more like sharing than stealing because the gods still have the original fire. By analogy, uploading music, movies, and software is more like sharing than stealing because the authors and inventors still have the original files. Fire-sharing is a pun for file-sharing. "Fire wants to be free" is a pun for the slogan "Information wants to be free."\nThe title text refers both to Michael Bay, the director of the movies Transformers and Armageddon, and to the novel "Salvation War" by Stuart Slade, in which Humanity goes to war just as described. "Returning fire to the Gods with interest" is also the plot of the Terry Pratchett graphic novel The Last Hero.\n\n
