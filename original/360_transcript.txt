n\nFrom November 5, 2007 to February 12, 2008, the Writers Guild of America, East and the Writers Guild of America, West labor unions which represents film, television and radio writers working in the United States, went on strike as it sought increased compensation for its members work. Virtually all scripted American television shows shut down in mid-December, with many low-level production staffers being laid off.\nIn late December and early January, late-night talk shows did eventually return, most of them without writers. But as of the date this comic was written, the popular Comedy Central political comedy shows, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, were still off-air.\nCueball and Black Hat both admit that they\'re pretty bummed about having to go through an election season without Jon Stewart\'s insightful commentary, but Black Hat has corrected that problem by kidnapping Stewart, putting him in the basement and occasionally soliciting hilarious opinions. Of course, Stewart is rather traumatized by this, and doesn\'t have anything to say aside from "Please let me go.".\nThe title text implies that Black Hat also kidnapped Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report, and put him in the attic. As opposed to Stewart, who basically plays "himself" on the show and is surrounded by zany reporters playing characters, on his own show Colbert plays the character of a "well-intentioned, poorly informed high-status idiot". The reference to everyone listening to Colbert instead, is based on a general opinion that The Colbert Report, a spin-off of The Daily Show, is superior to the original program.\n\n
