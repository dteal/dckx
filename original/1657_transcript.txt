n\nIn this comic White Hat quotes a famous "definition of insanity" (usually attributed to Albert Einstein, but may be a loose paraphrasing from Narcotics Anonymous) adapted by Rita Mae Brown or others historically.\nCueball\'s answer applies the quote to the action of quoting that quote. White Hat seems to have quoted that quote quite a few times already, expecting people to change their behavior which hasn\'t happened so far. So according to that definition of insanity, it is insane to keep quoting the definition of insanity, expecting people to change their behavior because of that.\nMerriam-Webster defines "insane" as "mentally disabled."\nThe title text implies that Randall would be "insane" according to the quote he used in the comic because he has repeatedly searched for a definition of insanity that matches the one quotes in the comic and of course always gets a negative result, since this is a personal quote not a definition. Besides searching in lots of dictionaries, he also looked in the DSM-4 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition). The DSM-5 has been available since May 18, 2013 and he plans to look into it, expecting different results. Since he won\'t find it, he is from the quote insane, but of course since this turns out to not be the definition of insanity then he might not be anyway.\nThis comic follows a pattern similar to 1339: When You Assume.\n\n
