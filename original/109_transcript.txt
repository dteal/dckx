n\nThis comic refers to several unexpected plot twists from various Hollywood movies and combines them into one giant twist invented by Randall. A "spoiler" is a term used to describe information about the plot of any media which could spoil the media for someone who has not viewed it. The term "spoiler alert" has become popularized to precede such spoilers particularly in online posting as a warning to potential readers. It is also a phrase often used ironically or angrily to suggest that something someone has just said is a spoiler.\nSeverus Snape is a character from J.K. Rowling\'s Harry Potter series of books.\nTrinity is a character from The Matrix trilogy of movies.\nRosebud is from the 1941 film Citizen Kane.\nFrom the title text, Tyler Durden is a character from the novel and movie Fight Club.\nAll four references share the common ground that they are all involved in significant events or ideas in their respective movies that have been often spoiled by careless viewers for those who have not yet seen the movies. Here the relevant events are mashed together into one and spoiled in one go.\n\n\n\nSpoilers in this comic\n\n\nIn this comic, Snape is depicted knocking Trinity off a high place with a wooden sled named Rosebud.\n\n\nSnape kills someone important, by knocking them off a building.\n\n\nTrinity dies\n\n\nRosebud is a sled\n\n\nTyler Durden is both characters\n\nThe event depicted in the comic did not actually occur in any movie.\n\nTrinity (the female protagonist in The Matrix series) is killed in the third film, The Matrix Revolutions. The central mystery of the classic film Citizen Kane is the meaning of "Rosebud" (the title character\'s last word), which is revealed at the end of the film to be the name of his childhood sled. In Harry Potter, Snape (a professor at the Hogwarts school) kills Dumbledore (the headmaster) at the top of the Astronomy Tower in the penultimate book of the series, "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" (in the final book we learn that it was part of Dumbledore\'s plan).\nThe title text refers to the film Fight Club, at the end of which it is revealed that the character played by Ed Norton is actually Tyler Durden (the name Brad Pitt\'s character goes by); and Pitt\'s character is really just a figment of the Norton character\'s imagination; and that the viewer has been watching from Norton\'s point of view, seeing Pitt doing things Norton did not want to admit to himself he was capable of. In other words, the two roles are one and the same character, implied to be suffering from a split personality.\n\n
