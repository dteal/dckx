n\nCueball observes Megan walking around at midnight, reading a book that he can\'t see. Curious, he leaves his apartment to ask her what she is reading. It is revealed as Orson Scott Card\'s Xenocide, the third book in the Ender\'s Game series following Ender\'s Game and Speaker for the Dead.\nXenocide is regarded by fans as one of the weakest books in the series, while Ender\'s Game and Speaker for the Dead received extreme positive praise. When he discovers that she likes Xenocide more than the other two books, he instantly withdraws to his apartment, his opinion of her shattered. So far as Cueball is concerned, Xenocide is so clearly inferior that he could not be with anyone who \'wrongly\' considers it to be the best of the series.\nThe title text pokes further fun at Xenocide by saying that there are only seven people in the world who would defend it, a laughably small number.\n\n
