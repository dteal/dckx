n\nThis comic is about the frivolousness of many modern problems. While an offscreen character is panicking over deleting a file, the turtle is content with just being a turtle. The text saying "turtles have it figured out, man" indicates that Randall appreciates this simpler mode of thought. The idea that computer problems are pointless when compared with the whole of life is similar to the sentiment expressed in the title text of 1173: Steroids.\n\n
