n\nThis comic reflects on the fact that no matter where you are on Earth, its core is always directly under you, while incredibly hot and under huge amounts of pressure. Yet most of the time, we ignore this completely unless there is a volcanic eruption (which by the way has nothing to do with the core, but mainly with the friction between the tectonic plates). \nCueball is presumably reading a geology book with diagrams and various facts about the Earth\'s interior, such as the core being subdivided into an inner core and an outer core, that the inner core is a solid ball, the size of the moon, that the outer core is at a pressure of 30 million Pounds per square inch (approximately 2 million times atmospheric pressure at sea level) and the outer core is made of molten metal in a constant turbulent motion - a bit like a pot of boiling water. But every time he gets 15 minutes in to such a book he freaks out, realizing this deadly stuff is right beneath him, and he bends over to look down to the Earth.\nThe title text makes a note of how cool it would be to study this without getting too terrified. So if you do - then let everyone you meet know what you do for a living as soon as you introduce yourself! (Despite most geologists and geophysicists don\'t study the core.)\nAlternately, the title text may be a reference the fact that someone gesturing downward would looks like he\'s pointing to his genitals, which could be considered inappropriate.\n\n
