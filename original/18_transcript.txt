n\nCueball hands another Cueball-like guy an apple calling it a Snapple. When the guy bites into it his teeth go clink against the apple\'s metal surface; Cueball has infused the apple with tin.\nThe fourth panel is a silent wide shot, perhaps suggesting the joke was met with silence as a weak joke. As a meta joke, the final panel might jokingly suggest that the silence is because those unfamiliar with the periodic table of elements don\'t get the joke.\nThe joke in this comic is pretty self-explanatory; especially given that the image text continues the trend in early xkcd comics of explaining the joke. Tin is a metallic element whose abbreviation on the periodic table is "Sn" (as the Latin word for tin is "stannum"). Thus, the apple is a "Sn-apple."\nSnapple is a brand of beverages -- mostly bottled juices and teas -- whose name is based on a carbonated apple juice they once produced ("snappy apple"). \nJames (in the caption) presumably once made a joke to Randall about tin or Snapple or both.\n\n
