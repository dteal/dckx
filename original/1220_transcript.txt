n\nThe word "hipster" originally referred to counter-cultural youth and jazz aficionados in the 1940s and 1950s before the Hippie culture developed in the mid \'60s. Recently, however, "hipster" has come to refer to, in Wikipedia\'s terms, "a subculture of young, urban middle class adults and older teenagers that appeared in the 1990s. The subculture is associated with independent music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility, progressive or independent political views, alternative spirituality or atheism/agnosticism, and alternative lifestyles."\nFollowing the hipster resurgence, it became popular in many circles to hold hipsters in contempt, citing their conformity to a subculture by rejecting "mainstream" culture and deliberate (i.e. ironic) indulgence in obnoxious things like moustaches and bad movies. Randall continues the arguably hypocritical meta-complaining by showing more s-curves that represent subsequent, smaller backlashes, self-referentially including his own comic in that meta-complaining.\nThere is a possible double meaning in the phrase "tedious navel-gazing by insecure people": the word "hipster" also refers to low-rise leg wear that sits at or below the hips, often in conjunction with revealing shirts, thereby exposing one\'s bellybutton.\nThe title text reveals Randall\'s awareness that he\'s only perpetuating the meta-complaining he\'s complaining about, but he bats away this criticism by pointing out the facts of the situation: the reader is not communicating with Randall but rather most likely in an empty room while browsing the Internet, which would make their argument effectively pointless.\nThe title text may be a reference to a previous comic,  525: "I Know You\'re Listening".\n\n
