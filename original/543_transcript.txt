n\nA Valentine\'s Day card from Randall to the xkcd readers. It is written inside a parody of the Sierpinski Triangle, a Sierpinski Valentine.\n\n  A Sierpinski triangle.\nThe Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal pattern made of triangles, covering a space. The way it works is to draw a triangle and draw another (upside down) one in the middle. Choose the upper, left and right triangle and repeat the process. Another valentine in the shape of a heart is 63: Valentine - Heart.\nThe &lt;3 in the title text is an emoticon for a heart and goes out to those of his readers that read the title text. Those who read the title text are usually more devoted to know that such a thing exists.\nAnother relevant comic to the Sierpinski Triangle is 95: The Sierpinski Penis Game.\n\n
