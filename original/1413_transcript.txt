n\nMany phrases that used to be of mainly academic interest become popular when an important event or global trend is described with such phrases in the media. Randall presents a timeline of past examples, and predicts phrases that may be popularised in the near future. The past events are a mix of buzz words and words learned through disasters, crime and terrorism. The future events seem to be all related to natural disasters or other kinds of serious issues, except Amplexus \xe2\x80\x94 which is the joke of the title text \xe2\x80\x94 showing that no matter how many disasters there are, people are generally more concerned about their teenagers\' sex lives.\nThe title text is also an example of a clickbait headline. Many organizations will post a link on social media to their content with a sensationalized headline in order to draw readers in. In this case, the headline is geared towards parents who are worried about their children being sexually active in this new Amplexus way. Such headlines are the internet\'s analog to television news\' promos ("A new trend among teens is sweeping the nation, but is it dangerous? Details at 11:00.").\nGlobal catastrophic risk is a theme throughout this comic. Randall predicts a large asteroid impact/near miss and a volcanic eruption, followed by an impact winter or volcanic winter. An insect borne, global pandemic without a cure also strikes, and then the technological singularity occurs.\nThis comic has similar features to 887: Future Timeline.\n\n
