n\nAccording to this comic, Steve Jobs, the founder of the Apple company, lost a lot of weight due to a hormonal problem. Weight loss is, in some cultures, considered an aesthetically good thing, though only in the context of being a deliberate action in order to remove obesity, which does not seem to be the case here. Black Hat then mentions that Apple was probably excited to announce its thinnest and lightest CEO in the industry. This comment is a parody of Apple\'s tendency to release thinner and lighter iterations of its products. Steve Jobs\' weight loss would certainly make him a thinner and lighter CEO.\nThe title text refers to Cory Doctorow, a blogger, journalist and science-fiction author. Doctorow is opposed to the technology called Digital rights management (DRM for short). DRM is designed to protect copyright owners, but can often be abused by large corporations with negative consequences for consumers. Randall (jokingly) proposes that Steve Jobs is only sick because Doctorow was torturing him with Voodoo dolls for Apple\'s use of DRM.\n\n
