n\nChristmas caroling is a tradition in which groups of singers travel from house to house, singing carols.\nThese carolers are in front of the BuzzFeed offices singing the The Twelve Days of Christmas, which usually contains:\n\nOn the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me.\n12 Drummers drumming\n11 Pipers piping\n10 Lords a-leaping\n9 Ladies dancing\n8 Maids a-milking\n7 Swans a-swimming\n6 Geese a-laying\n5 Golden rings\n4 Calling birds\n3 French hens\n2 Turtle doves\nAnd a partridge in a pear tree.\n\nThe carolers changed the lyrics to match the style of headlines of the topics published by BuzzFeed, which usually contain a number and a superlative; for example, 13 Worst Plane Crashes of the Decade or 8 Otters Who Are So Cute We Can\'t Even Handle It. This method of writing headlines, referred to as clickbait, is used by several other news sites, because it is known to generate a lot of visits and ad revenue. Randall has touched on this subject before in 1283: Headlines.\nCarolers are usually rewarded with a gift, but the BuzzFeed writers probably didn\'t appreciate the song, because they threw weird stuff at them which the carolers used in their 6th verse.\n\n
