n\nHere are the lyrics for the first verse of the Christmas Carol, "Good King Wenceslas"\n\nGood King Wenceslas looked out, on the Feast of Stephen,\nWhen the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even;\nBrightly shone the moon that night, tho\' the frost was cruel,\nWhen a poor man came in sight, gath\'ring winter fuel.\n\nWhile not a king, Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia is considered a martyr and a saint. Far from being responsible for any massacre, he protected his subjects from external dominance, and is still a national hero to the Czech people. Black Hat is supplying disinformation to unsuspecting carolers, either to shut them up or just because he\'s a classhole like that.\nThe title text references "the Feast of Stephen" which is also known as the "Feast of St. Stephen" or "St. Stephen\'s Day", which is a holiday celebrated on 26 or 27 December, depending on the Western or Eastern church respectively. It is not actually a feast that involved eating a person named Stephen, instead a celebration of the Saint named Stephen.\nIf you look closely, you can see that the carolers may be a family. The man and woman are confused by what Black Hat has said, and the girl is looking to the adults, perhaps gauging their facial reactions, or just waiting for their reply.\n\n
