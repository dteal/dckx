n\nThis comic is a reference to the press conference held by NASA on 28th September 2015, (the same day this comic was published), which confirmed the existence of liquid water at the surface of Mars. The comic was posted before the NASA press conference was held, although speculation about the announcement had already occurred.\nThe "questions" portion of the press conference is derailed by Beret Guy, acting as a reporter for a network known only as "The News". He first comments he is holding a microphone so he is "real loud now." He then asks how the news about Mars relates to other fields like medicine and sports. This may seem like an intelligent comment but the fields he mentions don\'t change at all with liquid water being on Mars.  Afterwards he asks if Mars has been "ruined" by getting wet, or if Mars will be okay when it dries out. Some things, e.g. indoor furniture, can be damaged by water, but Mars is not one of those things. When asked if he has any other questions he asks why Luke was being hassled at the Mos Eisley Cantina.  This causes the other reporters to forget their original questions and to join in on the irrelevant discussion, much to the dismay of the NASA scientist.\nThis is probably meant to mock previous NASA press conferences, where reporters have asked inane questions &#91;citation needed&#93; that reveal their total ignorance of the field.\nThe title text refers to Elon Musk, who suggested nuking Mars as a faster way of warming it up to make it habitable.\n\n
