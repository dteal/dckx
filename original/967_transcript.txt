n\nThis comic refers to the song America the Beautiful, which contains the line "amber waves of grain," which refers to the plentiful wheat fields in the Midwestern US. The waves, in this context, are being likened to the waves in the ocean, as the wind can make the wheat move in such a way as to resemble those.\nIn quantum mechanics the wave-particle duality explains that particles can act like both particles and waves depending on the context. Using a comedic adaptation of quantum theory, Megan states that the waves of grain become particles of grain when observed, which, in a way, is true. It\'s not a perfect analogy, however, because each grain is a separate entity while an external force, the wind, is what produces the wave motion.\nThe title text builds on the quantum mechanics principle that a laser is a coherent wave.  This leads of the absurd notion that one could harness waves in grain fields for use as a laser weapon, which would be used by one state to destroy two neighbors.  There is a long running joke in the Rocky Mountain West of completely obliterating nearby states, and in particular Nebraska. The use of the word "majestic" to describe the laser is a reference to another line in "America the Beautiful" \xe2\x80\x94 "for purple mountain majesties" \xe2\x80\x94 which does in fact allude to the Rocky Mountains in Colorado.\n\n
