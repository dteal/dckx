n\nThis is a comic about the potential pitfalls in finding an apartment on Craigslist. Just as in Craigslist, some of the posts are re-posted several times. Additionally, lots of posts use lots of tildes, exclamation points or asterisks as above to set their posts apart from others.\nBR means bedroom, e.g. 3BR means that apartment has 3 bedrooms (common measurement of apartment size).\n\n$1600 / 2BR ~~~ Hardwood floors, utilities included. Cats OK, limit one per square foot.\n\nThis ad is aimed at "crazy cat ladies/bachelors" who compulsively keep a number of animals much greater than is appropriate to the living space.\n\n$1100 / **** GREAT DEAL SQUARE HOUSE DOOR IN FRONT!!! ****\n\nThis is the first repetition of an entry that appears multiple times.  It is also extremely generic, telling the reader little useful about the house.  The square house might be a garage, or just a regular square house.  Beside that, most houses have a door in front, there\'s nothing special about a door.\n\n$2300 / 3BR&#160;!!!!!!!! Elegant apartment permanently lit by strobe light!!!! No floor.\n\nA strobe light is a very bright light that, instead of remaining on, flashes very quickly. It\'s frequently used in parties. A constant strobe light and the stated lack of a floor would probably make living in the apartment somewhat difficult.\n\n$980 / 1BR New "hammock"-style dwelling. Water and heat free from same dispenser. Viking landlord.\n\n This is a post to live as an oarsman on a Viking ship.  The water and heat presumably both come from the sky, in the form of rain and sunlight.\n\n$1550 / 2BR (one inside the other). Has running water, in a sense.  Free heat in short, intense bursts.  Klein stairs.\n\n This is a completely alien landscape, meant to be unimaginable and maddening. Possibly this represents some "other universe" or an extraterrestrial living space. Clearly this is unlivable, for humans at least.  Short, intense bursts of heat disturb if not kill. Stairs that do not have a clear top or bottom and rooms that can be seen as inside of each other would be confusing and impractical if not impossible to navigate.  Water that runs \'in a sense\' is disturbingly vague. Seems to be on a planet with a quick rotation, also close to a star, hence the "short, intense bursts" of heat. A Klein bottle is a surface which has no difference between "inside" and "outside", so essentially if you own a Klein bottle all the universe is inside it (and at the same time it is outside). It is physically impossible to build a Klein bottle in a three-dimensional space. A "Klein stair" is possibly a stair connecting a BR to itself. This is why the 2BR in this ad are "one inside the other".\n\n$3200 / 1BR W/trimmed carpet and pert fixtures. Previous tenants clean. Call now, want you inside. $120/night (no animals)\n\nThis is a disguised "adult services" (sex) posting, with references to trimmed pubic hair, an attractive body, and a lack of STDs.  Craigslist no longer allows posts for this, because prostitution is illegal in most places in the US.  This post tries to evade the adult services ban by pretending to be something else.\n\n$2100 / 3BR on scenic Ash Tree Lane. Builder unknown; house has always existed. Walls shift; center of house may contain minotaur.\n\n This Minotaur house is an ad for the house in the novel House of Leaves.   It may also refer to the Labyrinth in Ancient Greek mythology.\n\n$600 / 5BR Three floors w/pool, rooftop garden, beautiful glass facade, no catch, 5-min drive to historic Pripyat.\n\nThis is an ad for a residence in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located near to the town of Pripyat, in northern Ukraine. The NPP is a 3-level structure, and contains a pool for temporary spent nuclear fuel storage. The rooftop now has plants growing on it after years of neglect, and the glass facade references radioactive glassy minerals created by the explosion.\n\n$7100 / 60BR Sleek modern w/extreme running water. Previous tenants may resist entry. Contains all new wiring and is a submarine.\n\nThis house is a submarine, as indicated by the advertisement, presumably operated by a navy. The "previous tenants", being members of the armed forces, would undoubtedly resist entry of someone attempting to board their submarine. The sixty bedrooms refers to the crew members\' bunks on board the ship, which are in extremely tight quarters and can be very uncomfortable. This may also be a reference to 496: Secretary: Part 3, which makes reference to Black Hat stealing a submarine, presumably for 405: Journal 3 - apparently this is him trying to get rid of it.\n\n$1616 / 3BR + 2Bath, tub full of blood. Closet full of board games which play themselves. Pets OK but won\'t survive long.\n\n This is an ad for a house in a generic horror movie.\n\n$1600 / 1386153BR 3bath, modern sliding doors, guest rooms, garbage disposal. Free mandatory parking (enforced). Convenient to Alderaan.\n\nAppearing in the title text, this is a reference to the Death Star in Star Wars. Alderaan is the home planet of Princess Leia, which was obliterated by the Death Star. Mandatory parking references the tractor beams used to drag nearby ships (such as the Millennium Falcon) into the base. The garbage disposal refers to an iconic scene from Star Wars aboard the Death Star involving a garbage disposal. It seems somewhat inconvenient that this "apartment" has over a million bedrooms but only three bathrooms. The guest rooms are probably the detention blocks such as Detention Block AA-23.\n\n
