n\nThis is a mostly serious comic in which Randall expresses his thoughts while his fianc\xc3\xa9e started to suffer from breast cancer. He doesn\'t care about many things like politics anymore, there is just his fianc\xc3\xa9e\'s cancer and his romance with her.\nSome of his withdrawn activities are shown here:\n\nPolitics became prominent in 2008 due to the upcoming US presidential elections in November 2008.\n"Code not working even though it should work" is a common frustration in software development, when the developer is convinced to have covered every possible scenario, but their code still does not run as expected, because of some obscure tiny problem which they didn\'t think of and which often takes much time (and frustration) to find.\nJoss Whedon is best known as the creator and showrunner of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997\xe2\x80\x932003), Angel (1999\xe2\x80\x932004) and Firefly (2002), so he\'s the "cause" of emotions for Randall during the time they were aired.\n"People being wrong on the internet" is something that can easily annoy and preoccupy an internet-savvy guy like Randall, who knows the things they\'re (incorrectly) talking about; this was previously dealt with in the comic 386: Duty Calls.\n\nEventually, Randall\'s fianc\xc3\xa9e\'s cancer, once diagnosed, monopolizes all of his emotions, wiping out everything else as insignificant in comparison. Only the romance can get back a little bit of room as time passes. As the threat posed by the cancer wanes, a space opens up (the question marks) that the cancer concern used to occupy. The ordeal wiped out all the previous, more trivial concerns, pre-occupying him entirely with the disease. Now that there is a little less reason to worry, he\'s not used to thinking about anything else. His previous preoccupations no longer seem important, so what to fill his time with?\n\n
