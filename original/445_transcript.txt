n\nThe strip shows Cueball throwing a boomerang four times, each time finding a difficulty in catching it.\nThe first time, it merely hits him in the head.\nThe second time, six boomerangs come after him.\nThe third time, a shark somehow returns to him.\nThe fourth and final time, his girlfriend Megan floats back to him - then she states: "I\'m leaving you."\nThe title text refers to a bonus strip \xe2\x80\x94 if one reads the rightmost panels straight down, you get a strip that suggests that Megan threw multiple things at him out of anger before breaking up with him. This seems to mirror the plot of the 2006 comedy film My Super Ex-Girlfriend, in which the eponymous character throws multiple things at the protagonist (including a shark) prior to breaking up with him.\nBoomerangs returns in a kind of sequel 475: Further Boomerang Difficulties, which might also have yet another sequel in 939: Arrow. Finally boomerangs also became a main theme in the interactive comic 1350: Lorenz. The same format of multiple bad endings to the same starting set-up is used in 1515: Basketball Earth.\n\n
