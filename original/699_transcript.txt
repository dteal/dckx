n\nSome pregnancies are different than others, but a universal truth except in cases of Cesarean section is that a baby will always exit a woman\'s body through the vagina. Cueball is wearing a white lab coat and holding a clipboard, looking like a doctor, telling Megan that until the second trimester, the baby may decide instead to exit through any opening, including the mouth, anus, nose, navel, etc. This is absurd. The caption reveals the truth, that Cueball simply bought the lab coat, he is not a doctor, and is either pranking Megan, or is impersonating a physician for some other reason.\nThe expectation that a person in a white coat is a medical expert, or at least a scientist, can be seen in the studies of the placebo effect: people who receive a "sugar pill" from a person who has the authority implied by wearing a lab coat will experience a greater placebo effect than those who receive identical pills from a person in mufti. So doctors wear a white coat in clinic, and the expectation is reinforced. In some medical schools students receive a white coat as part of their graduation and qualification ceremony.\nThe title text implies also that in addition to faking being a doctor, he has also faked being a Nobel laureate, on the logic that people will not choose to verify this claim.\n\n
