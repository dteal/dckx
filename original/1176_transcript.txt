n\nCueball (likely representing Randall), has decided to leave conversations deemed toxic, by scooting a little bit away any time somebody badmouths someone not present. In each panel, he scoots progressively further away until he reaches an area with Megan, Hairy, and Beret Guy, discussing giant squids. He decides to join them, as this conversation is far more interesting to him than one criticizing people behind their backs.\nThe title text jokes that the second group, is, in fact, dissing the giant squid rather than discussing how cool it is. As the squid is not present&#91;citation needed&#93;, Cueball scoots back.\n\n
