n\nOn the day this comic was posted (September 30th 2016), the Rosetta mission ended with the final descent of Rosetta onto the comet 67P. Landing Rosetta on the comet gave the scientists (Ponytail, Megan and Hairy) a chance to collect extra data from very close to the comet, using the spacecraft\'s powerful sensors. \nCueball however assumed that the landing was a "kinetic impact" mission to deflect a comet that was on a collision course with Earth. A similar scenario (but using a nuclear weapon implanted inside of the asteroid to deflect it) was depicted in the 1998 film Armageddon, of which Cueball is apparently a fan.\nIn reality, at the time Rosetta landed, 67P was already leaving the inner solar system and was a long way past Earth. It will return to the inner solar system in around 5 years time, but its orbit will not pass close of the Earth in any forseeable time.\nAlso, as the title text hints, Rosetta\'s speed was only 90 cm per second relative to the surface at the moment of impact (or about 2 mph/3.25 km/h; the speed of a slow walk), while the comet was travelling at 14.39 km/s. Given that Rosetta only weighs a couple of tons (or six horses), and 67P weighs nearly 10 billion tons (or 22 billion horses), Rosetta\'s landing will have no actual measurable effect on the comet\'s momentum.\nRosetta (and its lander, Philae) were previously the subject of the comics 1402: Harpoons and 1446: Landing, and were mentioned in 1461: Payloads, 1547: Solar System Questions and possibly 1621: Fixion.\n\n
