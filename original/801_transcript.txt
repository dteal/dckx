n\nJava is a programming language touted for its Portability\xe2\x84\xa2, which sometimes leads to it being used in systems where it really just shouldn\'t be used. Cueball laments that the hardware he\'s tinkering with, despite being used for a single purpose, has its firmware written in Java; since the microprocessor is unknown, it\'s quite possible the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) had to be ported over to the processor before the hardware designers could write firmware for it. Presumably, they considered this worthwhile to be able to write the control code in a language they\'re comfortable with, even though it probably would have been much simpler to just write the control code in whatever language they used to port the JVM in the first place.\nBlack Hat explains that this is really an example of an age-old adage: "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail", also referred to as the "law of the instrument" or, as in the title, the "golden hammer". The hardware developers probably only knew Java, and when they thought about how to write firmware for their new device, "Java" was the only solution that occurred to them.\nOf course, instead of a hammer and a nail, Black Hat\'s analogy is about using bolt-cutters and vodka to get through the lock on Wolf Blitzer\'s boathouse. Not-so-coincidentally, Black Hat is holding a pair of bolt-cutters and a bottle of vodka. The implication is that Black Hat did, in fact, break into Wolf Blitzer\'s boathouse the previous night, which is why he has just now entered the door at the start of the strip. The changes he makes to the adage implies that he believes vodka and boltcutters are designed specifically to be used on Wolf Blitzer\'s boathouse, an interpretation that fits Black Hat\'s warped and anarchic disposition.\nThe title text implies that Black Hat had to break into a number of boathouses before he found Wolf\'s, and that his boat did not survive the evening.  The use of the phrase \'our night\' allows us to infer that Black Hat may have been with Danish, his partner in crime.\n\n
