n\nCueball explains to Megan that he is having computer problems. Normally, he is able to manipulate a "pattern" on his "metal rectangle full of little lights" (a reasonable, if oversimplified description of generated images displayed on a monitor). Today, however, the "pattern" is "all wrong". Megan suggests that he might be able to fix it by pressing more buttons, but following her advice doesn\'t seem to have the desired effect.\nAccording to the title text, Randall uses a similar technique to explain his computer problems to his cat. Cats have the habit to walk over or lay on keyboards so they press a lot of buttons. This is however not to fix the "pattern" which they usually don\'t care about but rather to get the same attention the keyboard receives from the cat\'s owner. Often cats prefer to lay on a warm place \xe2\x80\x94 and a keyboard belonging to a notebook is designed to dispense some heat.\nAs evidenced by both past and future comics, Randall likes to make an effort to explain things for simple minds.\nSpeculatively, Randall may be commenting on the abstract nature of events that effect Cueball\'s happiness or well being. While the work Cueball does on the computer seems very important to him, the deconstructed version as discussed by Megan and Cueball make his resulting distress seem out of proportion. This interpretation is further supported by the title text in which Randall\'s cat, unaware of more abstract representations of activity on the computer, enjoys greater happiness overall.\nThe concept of using simple English to explain complicated problems was first used in 547: Simple and has been revisited in 1133: Up Goer Five and 1436: Orb Hammer.\n\n
