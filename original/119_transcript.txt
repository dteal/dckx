n\nA hedge clipper or hedge trimmer is a gardening tool for trimming hedges or bushes. The pun is that motor driven hedge trimmers produce a bad, loud sound; but maybe the sound of the band is even worse.\nThe title text suggests that they (or at least the lead guitarist) previously did not know their band\'s name. As he bemoans his apparent inability to choose a good band name he probably sees the name \'Hedgeclipper\' as the reason why the band has no audience.\n\n
