n\nCueball spots a woman while shopping. He thinks she looks cute - probably because she looks a lot like his girl friend Megan. She is picking out produce, and quotes a line of dialogue from Firefly originally said by River Tam (Summer Glau): "My food is problematic." Cueball (Randall) who is a big fan of Firefly, notices this, and wants to flirt with her. But then Cueball\'s internal monologue kicks in and he starts panicking, wondering how he\'d deal with starting a relationship with this woman when he\'s moving in the fall, as well as how things are going to work out with Megan, should things work out with this girl. He panics, needs a way out and jumps out the window.\nIn real life, jumping out the window would be a very bad idea.&#91;citation needed&#93;\nThe title text refers to yet another Firefly line, this one said by Wash (Alan Tudyk): "Did he just go crazy and fall asleep?"\n\n
