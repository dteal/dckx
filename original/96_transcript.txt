n\nWe see Cueball on a phone with someone who sends various strange things through postal mail. The third panel is a pun on the usage of the phrase \'a lot of time.\' Normally, this means that something will take a while to finish; in this case, however, it means it is literally a large quantity of time that is being sent.\nQuantizing time ("discrete packets of time") is a theory that time is not continuous like as particles in the quantum mechanics. It could be one of the big mistakes in modern science, but feels as if there\'s more to it, in the world of romance, sarcasm, math, and language.\nThe title text states that due to his habit of mailing strange things, he has been barred from sending mail through the United States Postal Service (USPS).\nA no fly list is a list of people that are not allowed to use commercial airlines for travel in the United States. It is maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center. Here the person sending strange objects through mail is on the USPS no-fly-list for people. The joke here is that USPS does not have such list for people. There is a list of items banned from being shipped by USPS, which includes most consumer electronics with lithium batteries. It could also imply that the sender attempted, at one point, to mail themselves via air mail.\nThis comic might be related to W. Reginald Bray, an Englishman from the turn of the 20th century, who was famous for mailing unusual objects (including himself) to experiment with the postal system (detailed link here).\n\n
