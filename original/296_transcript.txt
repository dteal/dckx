n\nCueball is seen using a PSP, a hand-held game system, while on a skateboard. He is playing one of the many Tony Hawk titles in which you control a skater and perform tricks to gain points and achievements. While playing the game on his PSP, he wants to simultaneously perform the trick in real life both because it is exceptionally difficult to do both and because the game will give him praise when he does a trick successfully.\nIn the title text Randall describes his Bad idea Number 271: Dropping into the half-pipe on a Segway. \nOne imagines this would result in the Segway becoming unstable and going completely crazy, hence one would classify it as a "bad idea". \nWhich is surprisingly not the case, it even looks quite fun.\nThe Segway engineers obviously foresaw this situation and implemented the Segway controller with its tilt sensors accordingly.\n\n
