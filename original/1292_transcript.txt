n\nThis is yet another of Randall\'s compromise comics. A few mathematicians argue as to whether to use pi, which is the ratio between a circle\'s circumference and its diameter, or tau, which is the ratio between a circle\'s circumference and its radius.\nSome consider pi to be the wrong convention and are in favor of using tau as the circle constant; see the Tau Manifesto, which was inspired by the article "Pi is wrong!" by mathematician Robert Palais. Others consider proponents of tau to be foolish and remain loyal to pi (see the Pi Manifesto). Of course, regardless of which convention is used, the change is merely in notation \xe2\x80\x94 the underlying mathematics remains unaltered. Still, the choice of pi vs. tau can affect the clarity of equations, analogies between different equations, and how easy various subjects are to teach.\nMost people know \xcf\x80 (pi) by the approximation 3.14, but do not know \xcf\x84 (tau) which, by definition, is twice as large as pi. Randall is suggesting using "pau", which is a portmanteau of "pi" and "tau", as a number situated, appropriately enough, halfway between pi and tau, i.e. 1.5 pi or 0.75 tau. But of course his number would be inconvenient, as this value does not naturally turn up when working with circles or other mathematical constructs, so there are no commonly used formulas that would use pau.\nThe title text claims that pau can be approximated by e+2, as both values are roughly 4.71 \xe2\x80\x94 a similarity that holds little since it requires another irrational constant, e. It also attributes the nickname "Devil\'s Ratio" to pau, due to the sequence 666 supposedly appearing four times in the first 200 digits of pau when expressed in the octal base. However, this is not the case, and was likely due to an error in the computer system used by WolframAlpha; for more details see below.\n\n
