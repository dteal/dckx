n\n"Could not reproduce" (CNR as per the title) is used here as a double entendre. Because the reported bug is that speech recognition failed on a young child\'s voice, the programmers attempt to reproduce (biologically) in order to have a child to use as a test subject to understand and fix the bug, starting by reproducing it (the bug). However the attempt fails, as shown by the negative pregnancy test, and therefore the bug report is closed with the reason being "could not reproduce": they could not reproduce the bug because they could not reproduce biologically.\nThis reason also shows up in comic 937: TornadoGuard.\nThe title-text "Can\'t and shouldn\'t" qualifies the bug report, meaning that the programmers not only could not reproduce, they also should not reproduce given their unacceptable motive as well as poor child-rearing skills (demonstrated in comic 674: Natural Parenting).\n\n
