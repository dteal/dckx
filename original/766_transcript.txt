n\nGreen flash refers to an optical phenomenon which occurs at twilight (early dawn or late dusk), where a flash of green light can be seen at the very edge of the sun. Black Hat attempts to distract Cueball with this event so that he may knock out Cueball with the bottle in his hand and steal his new car, a Tesla Roadster. If the bottle is green, it would also be the cause of the green flash.\nThe title text simply continues this, wherein Black Hat jokes that Green Flashes are actually caused, at least in part, by the fact that he has a cool car worth stealing.\n\n
