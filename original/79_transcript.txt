n\nIn this part of the My Hobby series, the hobby is responding to casual questions using iambic pentameter. Iambic pentameter is a form of poetic verse defined by the number of syllables per line. In this form, a line contains exactly five (penta means five in Greek) "iambs" per line. An iamb is a unit of two syllables with the stress falling on the second. The actual breakup of the words is unimportant; the definition is based solely on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. One line of strict iambic pentameter will have ten syllables, with the stress falling on the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and last.\nIn this comic Cueball (i.e. Randall - the one with the hobby) is replying to his friends questions. (The friend also looks like Cueball, but are here differentiated by who has the hobby.) Cueball\'s responses are each one line of iambic pentameter, just visually broken into two lines for space reasons. They read (adding the emphasis):\n\n"Well, I can meet the plane at ten of six" and \n"I\'ll meet him at the stairs before the gate", \n\nwith a sort of bouncing rhythm (interestingly, both of the friend\'s questions are in iambs as well, though not pentameter). Shakespeare was one of the most famed users of iambic pentameter in his plays. \nThis is the "strict form" of iambic pentameter. In practice, poets often strayed from the strict count of iambs as the image text suggests. Wikipedia offers two Shakespearian examples being "Now is the winter of our discontent" in which the first iamb is reversed ("Now" is stressed rather than "is"), and "To be or not to be, that is the question" which adds an extra unstressed syllable at the end. As the comic suggests in the title text, without such exceptions, it can be very difficult to stick to strict iambic pentameter for every sentence.\nIambs and other types of poetry "feet" is the subject of 1383: Magic Words.\n\n
