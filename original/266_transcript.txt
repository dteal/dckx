n\nMegan is very unsure about what to think of her situation. Is it a dream? Is she in danger? She should be scared but isn\'t, and it does not feel like a dream, i.e. it feels real even though she suspects it is a dream. This would usually never be the case. If your dream feels realistic, you do usually not consider that you are dreaming.\nSuddenly someone talks off-panel and tells Megan that she has been found. When Megan asks the speaker who it is, reality becomes even more distorted, and suddenly she finds that she is looking at herself outside the sphere. And the two Megans say hi...\nIn the title text she realizes that if she were in real space she wouldn\'t be able to hear any sound, like the voice talking to her, due to the lack of atmosphere.\nThe series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday).
