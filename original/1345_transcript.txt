n\nCueball claims that humans are driven by their curiosity, which is never-ending. Megan responds by noting that everyone spends approximately eight hours per day in an unconscious state of sleep, but no one has yet pinned down the biological purpose of sleep. Despite this obvious mystery, most people aren\'t "losing sleep over it." This implies that Cueball\'s observed curiosity has a perceptible and proximate limit.\nThis is not to suggest that scientists aren\'t researching sleep; scientists frequently conduct sleep studies \xe2\x80\x94 we just haven\'t found any satisfactory answers yet. Some popular hypotheses are to allow the brain a period to consolidate memories and to give the body a chance to repair itself.\nThe title text quotes William Dement: people sleep "because we get sleepy." (Secrets of sleep). This of course is dodging the underlying issue. That this non-explanation is the best answer that a leading sleep researcher can provide, shows how little anyone knows about the subject. This may be an oblique reference to the French playwright Moli\xc3\xa8re dormitive principle, who created a satirical character who claimed to have discovered the answer to a popular question: The reason opium makes someone sleepy, said the character, a doctor, was that it contained a "dormitive principle" (i.e., something that makes someone sleepy).\nAt Hallucinations, Randall expressed similar surprise at the lack of interest in the nature of sleep.\nThe phrase "and nobody knows why" is commonly appended to urban legends, as in A duck\'s quack doesn\'t echo, and no one knows why. The implication is that something mysterious is going on and scientists are puzzled. 1186: Bumblebees is another "nobody knows why" example.\n\n
