n\nThis comic refers to a common analogy used to explain how mass distorts space-time \xe2\x80\x94 a bowling ball resting on a sheet of rubber distorts the sheet due to its weight. The system has some qualitative features in common with gravity; it\'s often misused to show that "mass warps spacetime" (895: Teaching Physics).\nThe next part of the original analogy explains a black hole: the slope of the sheet becomes so deep that you can\'t climb out from the bottom any more, similar to a black hole, which even light can\'t escape from. However, the comic subverts the analogy, and the sheet becomes a trampoline instead.\nThe line "Imagining is fun!" is also a homage to Richard P. Feynman\'s "Fun to Imagine" Series of Interviews.\nThe title text also states that the rubber sheet, broken rope and our whole life is all about physics (see also 435: Purity).\n\n
