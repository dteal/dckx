n\nThis cartoon is a romantically mature musing about time, and how even though we may not always realize it the progression of time is one of the better things in life.\nTo accurately describe the world requires at minimum three spatial dimensions and the fourth dimension, time. The spatial dimensions don\'t necessarily have to be the familiar Cartesian system (Forward/backward, Right/Left, Up/Down), but can be described in many ways (like the spherical or cylindrical system). In spite of the fact that we are being pushed around the universe by being on Earth, we can exercise some control over these spatial dimensions by moving, and therefore our trajectory through these dimensions are not inexorable (impossible to stop). As we only can go one direction in time and have no way of changing the speed, we also are figuratively being pushed through time, and this movement is inexorable.\nCueball sits under a tree un-moving with Megan simply enjoying the passage of time and says "Of the four dimensions I could have spent my life being pushed inexorably forward through, I guess "time" isn\'t the worst." All of this amounts to an unusually erudite way for Cueball to say he feels content with how his life has turned out, despite the natural doubts one has as they get older.\nIn the title text Cueball then continues to muse about his favorite dimensions and places time in his top three dimensions. This means that one of the three spatial dimensions must be his least favorite. Though it is impossible to determine how he defines his favorite dimensions, as dimensions can be defined somewhat arbitrarily, they likely are length, height, and time as comics only use these three (time being represented by panels). Since rising steadily and digging downward are both pretty lethal, one could assume that Randall\'s least favorite dimension is up/down. (See also the one of my favorite halves comment in 1556: The Sky)\nPreviously Randall has made a comic about a man who was pushed sideways \xe2\x80\x94 so he was pushed both through time and fell sideways: 417: The Man Who Fell Sideways.\n\n
