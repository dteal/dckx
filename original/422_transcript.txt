n\nIn the United States prom (short for promenade) is a semi-formal (black tie) dance or gathering of high-school students. They normally are awkward experiences for nerdy people.\nA LAN party is a temporary gathering of people with computers or game consoles, between which they establish a local area network (LAN), primarily for the purpose of playing multiplayer video games. They are normally very informal.\nCueball is likely taking the girl to Prom, but stops when he sees there\'s a LAN party in formal attire, meaning they wouldn\'t be out of place. The comic title is likely what Cueball is going to say to the girl, since the LAN party is probably much more appealing for him than a formal ball.\nThe title text indicates that Randall would have loved for such a thing to be possible, so much that he very nearly would redo high school just to participate.\n\n
