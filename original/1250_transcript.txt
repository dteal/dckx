n\nCueball is very dramatically following the described process of removing himself from a social network by first unfriending each contact. Such actions are not necessary on any well-designed website. Actively unfriending people individually could be perceived as rude, antisocial, or in need of help. \nEven though one may not have visited a social network for years, they are still sitting there, gathering one\'s "friends\'" statuses opinions and comments. \nThe reverse order to unfriend people refers to correct memory allocation and deallocation processes for computers. If one does not follow this process and deallocates an older memory block before a newer one, all information about the newer block could be lost. This would prevent the user from being able to deallocate it. If the process repeats over and over, memory usage will accumulate and will eventually result in an out of memory error. \nThis is not needed on databases, but databases used on websites, such as social networking sites, could run into a similar issue. If accounts are deactivated the users that were friends to the deactivated account may maintain the link to the deactivated account. This could (if the database was not well designed) create a non trivial amount of garbage data.\nIn the title text, "database linkage accumulation slowdown" really is a thing that Randall just made up. This may be a satire of popular fears of made-up technological problems, often held by those who are not technologically savvy.\n\n
