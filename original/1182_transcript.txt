n\nRembrandt was a 17th-century Dutch artist. Megan shows Cueball an alleged photo of Rembrandt\'s parents at the time that his mother became pregnant; his conception. Since photography wasn\'t invented until the 19th century, it can\'t be a real photo. Megan responds to Cueball\'s disbelief by stating that it is an artist\'s conception: an artistic imagination and depiction of an event.\nThe joke thus is a pun on the phrase \'artist\'s conception\' that can mean two different things: one, Rembrandt\'s mother becoming pregnant with him and two, the creation of the image.\nThe title text refers to James McNeill Whistler who painted a portrait of his mother, known to Whistler himself as "Arrangement in Grey and Black No1" but more commonly known as "Whistler\'s Mother". As a joke on this, Megan seems to want to show a photo of Whistler\'s mother, which would probably be pornographic or at least different from the famous portrait. The&#160;::click:: is Megan switching to that picture on her laptop.\n\n
