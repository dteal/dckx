n\nThis is a reference to a mistelling of a joke (see the first of the meta versions under the wiki link). \nThe original, correct telling of the joke is:\n\nThink of words ending in "-gry". "Angry" and "Hungry" are two of them. There are only three words in the English language. What is the third word? Hint: The word is something that everyone uses everyday. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is.\n\nPhrased this way, the answer is "language" because "There are only three words in (the phrase) \'the English language\' ."\nHowever, this joke is often mis-told by poorly phrasing the original riddle, as it is in the comic. By instead saying, "There are three words in the English language that end in \'-gry,\'" the teller of the joke has actually removed any chance of determining the correct answer.\nAs such, when Cueball attempts to say the answer is "language" and act smugly about it, Black Hat is unimpressed and cuts off Cueball\'s hand.\nHowever, as Black Hat mentioned in the comic, if you count obscure and archaic words, there are English words that ends with "-gry". Some are listed here\nThe title text refers to postmodernism, a philosophy and corresponding art movement. Postmodern music is often minimalist, as exemplified by the weird sounds of Philip Glass and Steve Reich, and postmodern visual art saw trends such as lowbrow and installation art gain attention. Apart from a rejection of modernism, however, it is difficult to outline postmodernism to justify the strange works of art. Deconstruction is another important concept, but it is difficult to describe the process. In short, postmodernists make art that no one understands and may act smugly about it; but they do not adequately explain what their art means or it doesn\'t really mean anything i.e. there is nothing to understand. Thus, Black Hat\'s statement: that such practice is not "cleverness", applies to them as well.\n\n
