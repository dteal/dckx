n\nThis is a continuation of the previous comic in "The Race" series, 580: The Race: Part 4.\nIn panel 6 (2nd panel in the 2nd row), Nathan Fillion line is reminiscent of a similar quote from the 2nd episode of Firefly, The Train Job: "I just wanted you to face me so she could get behind ya." In the show, Malcolm Reynolds is aided by Zo\xc3\xab Washburne, his second in command, who gets behind the bar thug he is speaking to. In the comic, Nathan Fillion is using the line on a fan, but Gina Torres is not standing behind Cueball this time.\nSummer\'s line about growing but not retracting her hair appears to mean that because Nathan used her to stop Cueball, she has to stop him as well, which she neatly does. Alternatively, the line may be a random non-sequitur of the sort often uttered by her neurologically damaged character in the Firefly \'verse.\n"Bwah!" is a sound Malcolm makes during one episode in which one of his crewmembers inadvertently sneaks up on him while trying to ask him a question. When he is questioned about it, he says he has invented a new war cry, and promptly practices yelling \'Bwahhhh\' in a confident manner while readying his pistol.\nSummer\'s statement in the 10th panel about swallowing a bug is a reference to the movie Serenity, made in 2005 to conclude Firefly\'s storyline. After a harrowing high-speed chase in an open-topped hovercraft, the only comment from Summer\'s character is "I swallowed a bug," showing that she was either unconcerned, or stunned, by the narrow escape.\nThe final panel is a reference to Fox TelevisionTV\'s treatment of Firefly. Firefly was cancelled after only 11 episodes of the 14 made were aired, leaving three episodes unaired.\nInternet petitions, contrary to the sarcastic suggestion in the final panel, pretty much never work.\nAll comics in "The Race" series:\n\n577: The Race: Part 1\n578: The Race: Part 2\n579: The Race: Part 3\n580: The Race: Part 4\n581: The Race: Part 5 (this one)\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.\nElectric skateboards have been the subject of several other comics like 139: I Have Owned Two Electric Skateboards, 409: Electric Skateboard (Double Comic) and a panel in 442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel.\n\n
