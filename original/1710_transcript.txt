n\nCueball comments on the rate of his walking into things while distracted by various stimuli, comparing it to a controlled study where the aim is to research whether he is most likely to bump into something while looking at a book, at his phone, or staring at the sky (something Randall does a lot with his interests in astronomy, optical phenomena, weather phenomena and kites). \nMegan replies that if this is the case, the rate of the "control group" colliding with things is also weirdly high. In Cueball\'s metaphor, the "control group" would be his walking around without being distracted, so you would expect him not to collide with anything when able to give his full attention to where he\'s going. Thus, Megan is implying that Cueball is simply clumsy or easily distracted by other events or his own thoughts, and that his walking into things has little to do with whether he\'s looking at his phone, in a book or at the sky. Cueball responds defensively, saying that "walking [without bumping into anything] is hard, okay?"\nWalking actually is a difficult task, as can be observed when trying to teach a robot how to walk, or the time it takes for children to learn it (and the way that a baby\'s first steps are celebrated as an achievement and a milestone in their development.)\nIn the title text, Randall remarks that his childhood spent walking around with his nose in a book has prepared him "unexpectedly well" for today\'s world. Years ago, walking around while staring at something in your hands - such as a book - was considered odd, antisocial and dangerous, and was mostly the province of bookworms and nerds. Yet now, it\'s commonplace for people to walk around staring at their phones. This, ironically, makes those "antisocial" people who grew up used to walking around while reading the best-adapted to navigating while using a smartphone.\n\n
