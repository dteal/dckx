n\nSports Illustrated, while a sports magazine (from what the title implies), is infamous for its Swimsuit Issue, a yearly issue that heavily features women wearing revealing swimsuits (again, from what the title implies), something generally agreed upon as inappropriate for children.\nHowever, the joke is on the father. Before he could stop the child from reading, the child had already made it clear that he has seen hard-core pornography in the pop-up ads he has encountered. He is familiar with the sight of women being "double penetrated" (i.e. engaged in simultaneous vaginal and anal sex), and indicates that these women are completely naked (implied by his surprise to see similar-looking women wearing swimsuits in the magazine). Thus, the swimsuit issue, in which the women are wearing some clothing and are not engaged in sexual activity, is relatively tame by comparison.\nThe title text has Randall suggest that pop-up blockers are far more important than The birds and the bees, a stance that other people would find backward. There is some sense towards this approach, however. While "the birds and the bees" would have to wait until the child has developed sufficiently in order to get the proper effect, pop-up blockers are a more urgent need that would prevent a child from looking at inappropriate content before then. Pop-up blockers alone would not prevent everything, but they are a valuable asset nonetheless.\n\n
