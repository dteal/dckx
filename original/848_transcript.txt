n\nString theory hypothesizes that there are many more than 3 dimensions, it\'s just that we can\'t see the rest because they\'re "rolled up." A common metaphor is an ant on a tightrope \xe2\x80\x94 it has two degrees of freedom, one along the rope and one around it, but from far away we can only see one.\nSo Black Hat released his 2D movie about string theory in "3D", and claimed that the third dimension was there \xe2\x80\x94 just too small to see.\nThe title text refers to linear particle accelerators, or "LINACs," which are used to create high-energy particles. Incidentally, the glasses give their particles one mega-electronvolt (symbol MeV) of energy, which is not particularly high for a particle accelerator. The title text suggests that such moviegoers should try the accelerators at the Center for European Nuclear Research, CERN, since they are widely known for producing the highest energies in the millions of MeV, and thus have the best chance of unraveling the small dimensions of string theory.\n\n
