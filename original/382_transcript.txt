n\nStraightforward comic playing on Megan\'s contradictory stance on Cueball\'s historical trebuchet project and her own auto-targeting kilowatt laser. \nShe explains her stance with the fact that her invention help keep the squirrels off the feeder. That it actually works is backed up by the fact that we hear a squirrel squeaking as it getz zapped by the very powerful laser. But getting hold of such a laser and programming the auto-targeting so it only zaps squirrels and not the birds is a very complicated process - and there are probably many other ways to keep the squirrels off the feeder. So Megan is of course no better than Cueball here.\nThe title text refers to egging, throwing eggs at houses, other objects, or even people. While this is illegal it\'s still a famous form of protest; more often it\'s simple random vandalism or pranking, most common on Halloween in the US. Generally targets are chosen at random, with little specific malicious intent towards the victim, although it\'s not unusual for people to seek out and target the property of those who they dislike.\nTrebuchets are referred to in later comics: 1160: Drop Those Pounds and 1190: Time. They are also mentioned in the title text of 1378: Turbine.\n\n
