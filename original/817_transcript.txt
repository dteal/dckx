n\nThe comic depicts Cueball and Megan simultaneously thinking about each other. It may be a deliberate prelude to the next comic.\nThe title text refers to the aspect of Quantum Mechanics where a system can exist in more than one state until it is observed. An observation is required in order to "collapse" the system into a particular state; the thought experiment of Schr\xc3\xb6dinger\'s cat is a popular way of explaining this concept. The title text proposes that, if a universe needed to be observed to exist, as with a quantum state, it would be a pretty sorry universe indeed, as who would exist to observe it if it needed to be observed in the first place?\n\n
