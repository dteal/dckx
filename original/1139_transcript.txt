n\n"I\'m rubber, you\'re glue; whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you" is a schoolground retort used by children to suggest that one\'s insults are being ignored by the intended recipient of the insult and counter that the insult rather refers to the insulter. On a deeper level, it may imply that a person insulting others is an indication of their own insecurity and weakness.\nIn this comic, a young Black Hat is reading a chemistry and physics handbook, which leads to a literal and graphic visualization of the phrase. He uses the retort to frighten the children bullying him, into calling for their mothers. The book is the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. It is also nicknamed the \'Rubber Bible\' or the \'Rubber Book\', as CRC originally stood for "Chemical Rubber Company".\n\n
