n\nAnother comic where Randall takes a less than serious look at sports.\nThe halftime pep talk of a basketball game is commonly used by coaches to inspire his team to come back from a seemingly insurmountable deficit, and to make strategic changes that will help them do so. Unfortunately, the basketball coach Cueball has absolutely no fundamental understanding of the sport, and has pulled his team (of Cueball-like players) into the locker room while the game is still in progress, enabling the other team to score at will. \nHe could have tried to get a time-out, but still he would not have been allowed to take his team down to the locker room.\nThe title text parodies a common plot of, especially US, sports movies in which an inexperienced team (and sometimes coach) still manage to win a title after a highly motivational pep talk (see for instance Hoosiers). In this case the players are not even just poor basketball players but rather chess players and the coach know nothing of the sport, the opposite of what is usually the case in said movies. And, of course, in this case those pessimistic about their chances were proved right.\nIn 1392: Dominant Players Randall compares basketball with chess.\n\n
