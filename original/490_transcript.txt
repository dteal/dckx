n\nThanks to the portability of the modern computer, the availability of the internet and the advent of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, someone could conceivably use their laptop to catch up on the lives of everyone they care about from the comfort of their own bed; indeed, they could do it under the covers if they want to.\nThis is rather different than the pre-computer days in which catching up with friends required a great deal more effort. Hence, laptops are weird.\nThe title text refers to the South Park episode "Gnomes", in which a race of tiny gnomes steal people\'s underpants. Their business plan is finally explained as:\n\nPhase 1: Collect underpants\nPhase 2:&#160;?\nPhase 3: Profit\n\nThis became an internet meme, used in situations where a person\'s or group\'s planned course of action held little clear relevance to their stated or inferred objective. As such although the list bears superficial similarity to a list ending in "Profit" using this as a punchline would not be particularly effective or funny, hence Randall has decided not to include this.\n\n
