n\nThe left Cueball comments on the absence of physical enforcement for social norms. The left Cueball goes through a list of possible things he could do that only his conscience and learned social morals prevent him from doing, including punching someone else in a conversation for no reason at all. This is enough to convince the Cueball on the right who promptly punches the left Cueball in the face.\nThe title text is a restatement of the first line of the comment, but reversed to show Cueball\'s newfound realization that the same freedoms apply to other people, to his physical detriment.\nThis is also an ironic reference to Zechariah Chafee\'s oft-quoted line, "Your right to swing your arms ends just where the other man\'s nose begins."\n"Getting on a plane to Fiji" is a reference to The Truman Show (1998).\n\n
