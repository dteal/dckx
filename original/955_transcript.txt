n\nThe "Neutrino exceed the speed of light issue" was an actual story from the day before the comic was posted. An experiment at CERN caused a stream of neutrinos to be passed from CERN in Switzerland to a receiving station at the INFN laboratories of Gran Sasso in Italy (LNGS). The initial findings from the experiment were that the neutrinos arrived at the detector in less time than a beam of light would have taken. The neutrinos had apparently exceeded the speed of light.\nAlbert Einstein famously posited that the speed of light in a vacuum is both constant and absolutely the fastest possible speed to accelerate to in the universe. Nothing can go accelerate tofaster. Therefore, a report that neutrinos have been found travelling faster than light challenges a fundamental law of physics and turns all of physics, or at least special relativity on its head.\nPrior experience has shown Cueball that in such cases, arguing with people and preaching caution is futile. Cueball realizes that it is more satisfying and profitable to place bets with them instead. His reasoning is that almost invariably, these supposedly world-changing discoveries end up falling apart after further investigation, and that if it doesn\'t, he wouldn\'t care. This is similar to Stephen Hawking\'s scientific wagers, where Hawking set bets such that, if he was wrong, he would be paid, and if he was right, he\'d have to pay and wouldn\'t mind because he\'d just have been proven right.\nThe title text is a reference to a graph published similar to, if not the same as, the one found here. The continental drift can be seen, as well as the clearly marked jump showing the earthquake in question.\nPostscript: Cueball (that is, Randall) was correct. The experiment was found to be flawed. Neutrinos are not faster than light, the data was probably wrong due to an incorrectly synchronized clock, or caused by some broken wiring on the receiving end.\n\n
