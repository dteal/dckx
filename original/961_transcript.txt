n\nSteve Jobs died on October 5, 2011, the day before this comic was posted. He was the CEO and one of the founders of Apple, Inc. He was the head of Apple for the introduction of OS X, the operating system used on all modern Macintoshes. In OS X when there is a lag, the Cursor becomes the symbol seen in the comic. This symbol is infamous among OS X users, and is nicknamed "the beachball". It appears during a lag, and can take a very long time to disappear, thus seeming endless.\nThe title and rotating cursor above a fixture in the ground seems to be referencing the John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame, suggesting that the rotating cursor above the fixture is, in fact, a monument to Steve Jobs.\nThe title text refers to the fact that on the Mac, the application sometimes recovers and the system comes back; other times, however, the damage is irrevocable, a Kernel Panic happens and the system needs a restart.\nA similar tribute comic was also dedicated to Terry Pratchett, the day after he died, in 1498: Terry Pratchett, and to Gary Gygax, three days after he died, in 393: Ultimate Game.\n\n
