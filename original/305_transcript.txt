n\nCueball is rather surprised to find slash fiction (same-sex erotic fiction featuring characters from popular media, often from unrelated series) featuring characters from the Thomas the Tank Engine television series, but Megan isn\'t remotely surprised, citing Rule 34: "If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions."\nCueball denies the truism of the rule, coming up with several examples of porn that doesn\'t exist yet, until he comes across one that they both agree would be pretty hot: Women playing electric guitar in the shower. Megan proceeds to get ahead of the curve by registering WetRiffs.com.\nBy doing this, Megan invoked Rule 35, an additional rule based around rule 34. Rule 35 states: \'If there is not porn of it, porn will be made of it\'.\nIn the title text we can assume that the presenter in a spelling bee is asking a male participant with the name "Lance" to spell "throbbing",  a term sometimes used to describe the swelling of a person\'s genitals. The scene thus plays out like the start of a hypothetical spelling bee that could contain rude words or innuendo.\nRule 34 is mentioned in the title text of 505: A Bunch of Rocks and 860: Never Do This.\n\n
