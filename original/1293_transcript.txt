n\nFollowing on from his attempts at networking, Beret Guy, the oddball of the xkcd cast, conducts an interview for a programmer position at his mysteriously successful company.\nMuch like most of Beret Guy\'s interactions with people, Beret Guy is cheerful and upbeat, yet indicates that he has at best a scrambled understanding of how people in this situation normally act. Because of this, the job interview becomes increasingly bizarre, starting with Beret Guy\'s assertion that the company headquarters is a "real building [he] found", implying that the building\'s reality might be in question. He says his company makes phone accessories, but then adds, "like apps and stickers," two wildly different products in terms of both production and profitability. He is strangely vague about both the position ("someone to write on our computers") and the salary ("a bunch of paychecks"). Then he mentions ghosts, which is either a powerful disincentive from joining the company, yet another sign that Beret Guy is mentally unsound, or both.\nThe strip finishes with Beret Guy plugging a cord into an electrical outlet clumsily labeled "Soup," which then, implausibly, actually starts dispensing soup. Most businesses do not function like this.&#91;citation needed&#93; However, this is a typical behaviour of Beret Guy - see a similar example in: 1395: Power Cord.\nThe title text makes reference to the biblical story of Job (pronounced with a long O to rhyme with globe), who was put through many horrendous ordeals to test his faith in God. This suggests that the interviewee will be taking on not a "job experience" but rather a "Job experience" (i.e. the job will be a horrendous ordeal).\nOther job interviews were portrayed in 125: Marketing Interview, 1088: Five Years, 1094: Interview, and 1545: Strengths and Weaknesses.\n\n
