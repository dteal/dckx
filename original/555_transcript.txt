n\nIn folklore, Bloody Mary is a legendary ghost or spirit conjured to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is called multiple times (mainly 3). The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. The Bloody Mary appearances are mostly "witnessed" in teenage group participation games, often as part of a game of truth or dare.\nIn this xkcd comic, Megan sets up two mirrors facing each other, in which she can see herself receding ad infinitum. She then says "Bloody Mary" three times (as in the folklore) before ducking, conjuring an infinite number of malevolent spirits who jump from the mirror towards each other. It\'s not clear if they simply collide, or pass into the opposing mirror.\nDouglas Hofstadter (also referenced in 917: Hofstadter) is the author of G\xc3\xb6del, Escher, Bach and I Am a Strange Loop. In the former book, amongst many other discussions of infinite loops, he points a television camera at the screen on which its image is projected, forming an endless series of screens similar to panel 2 of this comic. In the latter book he focuses on the idea of minds being self-referential. "In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference". This blends with the idea of the images of the person looking in the mirror being reflected endlessly.\n\n
