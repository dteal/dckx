n\nA Bel-Air is an internet meme where a poster on a message board starts a post on a serious topic, but partway through the post switches to repeating the lyrics to the opening theme song of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air", a 1990s sitcom starring Will Smith (previously known in his rapping career as the "Fresh Prince") as a street-smart teenager from West Philadelphia who has been sent to live with his affluent and stuffy Aunt and Uncle in Bel Air, Los Angeles by his mother as a consequence of a single altercation with a couple of no-good guys who were making trouble in his previous neighbourhood.\nMegan in the comic reverses the traditional arrangement by starting the conversation with a recitation of the lyrics to said theme song, and then switching partway through to a very serious discussion of the status of their relationship culminating in a break up.\nThe lyrics go like this\n\nNow this is the story all about how \nMy life got flipped, turned upside down \nAnd I\'d like to take a minute just sit right there \nI\'ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air\n\nThe title RBA is an initialism for Reverse Bel-Air.\nThe title text could be the beginning of Cueball\'s future RBA.\n\n
