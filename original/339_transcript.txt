n\nCueball listens to the song "Stairway to Heaven" performed by Led Zeppelin using an old phonograph. Led Zeppelin were active during the 1970s, with Stairway To Heaven being released in 1971; as such, the music belongs to the Baby Boomer generation. After the song fades out to the end, he expresses how much it\'s affected him by stating that the baby boomers are winning over his own generation at music. The way in which the lyrics are written evokes the sound of this particular song as it finishes and fades out.\nThe title text refers to Pachelbel\'s Canon. Pachelbel\'s Canon is the informal name for the first movement of a piece of classical music by Johann Pachelbel, called "Canon and Gigue for 3 violins and basso continuo", written in the late 17th century. The music recently became popular again - during the era Led Zeppelin were most active - and is now found everywhere in pop culture. The joke is in the irony; the person speaking the title text is apparently unaware that the party he\'s offering a recording contract to has been dead since 1706.\nClassical Music was a movement which produced many musical compositions still remembered hundreds of years afterward, and the word \'classic\' is now used to describe something that remains popular long after its time. The "Baby Boomer generation" is known for having created many musicians still well-loved today, including:\n\nLed Zeppelin\nThe Who\nDeep Purple\nGenesis\nThe Doors\nPink Floyd\nJanis Joplin\nJimi Hendrix\nThe Rolling Stones\nStevie Ray Vaughn\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\nGrateful Dead\nThe Beatles\n...\n\n
