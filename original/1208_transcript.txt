n\nThis is a logic puzzle where the reader has to follow a confusing network of footnotes to determine whether the word "no" is to be ignored or not. The title text references comic 1184, playing on the typographical similarity between footnotes and exponents, as well as adding even more ridiculous rules.\nIn the following solutions, "right-associative" means that the footnotes are evaluated from right to left or top to bottom, and left-associative from left to right or bottom to top (e.g. (26)3 is left-associative, and 2(63) is right-associative.\n\n
