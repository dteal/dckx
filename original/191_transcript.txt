n\nLojban is a constructed language designed to be logical, unambiguous, and culturally neutral \xe2\x80\x94 similar to the better known artificial language Esperanto. The authors originally designed it as an experiment, but a few people have picked it up and tried to learn it. However, anyone actually willing to learn Lojban is someone Black Hat would rather avoid. Alternately, only people who speak Lojban, who comprise an admittedly tiny proportion of the general population, could benefit from the logic of the language, making the benefits of Lojban mostly pointless to most people.\nClicking on the original comic brings you to a Lojban translation of the comic.\nThe title text is also written in Lojban. It translates roughly as: "That was a joke. Really. Wanna be friends with me?"\nA more literal translation gives: "humorously that false. Please is-it-true-that you friend me?"\n\n
