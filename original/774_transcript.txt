n\nIn public debates, fundamentalist Christians and atheists, while having different opinions, can behave surprisingly similar. Both can be very dogmatic about their beliefs, and be very disrespectful and accusative towards people of the other standpoint. Cueball is blaming both parties for being annoying. Megan sarcastically remarks that Cueball then must feel superior to just about everyone.\nThe title text takes this one step further when Cueball realizes that Megan\'s reply is just as smugly superior as his. Such a superiority argument could go on ad infinitum. But by introducing an arbitrary stop rule "expires after one use per conversation", Megan tries to resolve this issue and superiorly wins the argument.\n\n
