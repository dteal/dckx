n\nThe super hero from just two comics ago, Etymology-Man, returns. And just like that comic, Etymology-Man is explaining the origination of words instead of actually helping. Etymology is the study of the history of words, their origins, and how their form and meaning have changed over time.\nWho they want is Entomology-Man because they are fighting a giant praying mantis and an army of smaller praying mantises (which are nonetheless much larger than a typical praying mantis - compared to the size of the people in this comic the smaller mantises appear to be 8-12 inches long). Entomology is the study of insects.\nIn the title text, we find out they accidentally call a superhero focused on the story of Adam and Eve in the Biblical book of Genesis. This is probably Etiology-Man (the study of causation and attribution), but might be Ontology-Man (the study of being and existence) or (as a pun) Adam-ology-Man.\n\n
