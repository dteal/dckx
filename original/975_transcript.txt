n\nCueball takes the useful practice of occulting stars beyond its intended purpose. Occulting is used to block the light from a star under observation so that adjacent dim objects, such as any surrounding planets, might be more easily detected and examined. Instead of blocking the light of a single star for the purposes of observation, Cueball proposes blocking the light from all stars, for the purpose of making him feel comfortable with the night sky. Cueball feels, some might say irrationally, that "there are too many stars, and it\'s been freaking [him] out".\nThe title text refers to both a Type II Kardashev civilization and a Dyson sphere.\nA Dyson sphere is a theoretical construction consisting of a network of satellites that orbit and completely surround a star. The purpose to capture and transmit all of the available solar energy back to a planet.\nA Type II Kardashev civilization is a theoretical civilization that has advanced to the point where it has harnessed the energy radiated by its own star (for example, the stage of successful construction of a Dyson sphere).\nFor comparison purposes:\n\nA Type I Kardashev civilization is one that has harnessed the energy of their entire planet.\nA Type III Kardashev civilization is one that has harnessed the energy of their entire galaxy.\nWe are currently less than I.\n\nThe title text reveals that Type II Kardashev civilizations construct Dyson spheres not for the purposes of capturing all solar energy, but merely to block the view of all that hideous space.\nThe concept of an occulting space telescope was visited again in 1730: Starshade.\n\n
