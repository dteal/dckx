n\nIn the comic, Megan is presenting evidence on her thesis, a theory on the evolution of threat defense in mammals, in front of a panel of some people. To conclude her exposition she charges at the audience, shouting a battle cry, and brandishing a sword. The audience flinches. As the audience is composed of mammals and is responding to a threat, we should assume that this response provides some key evidence about the threat defense in mammals.\nThis comic is a play on a thesis defense and the adage "The best defense is a good offense". The adage means that a strong offensive action will preoccupy the opposition and ultimately hinder its ability to mount an opposing counterattack, leading to a strategic advantage. A thesis defense generally involves an oral exam on the topic she has chosen, and should involve no physical violence.\nFor added humorous effect, in the title text Megan extrapolates how she improved the state of the art, i.e. what she has added to her field of study, while screaming the word art.\n\n
