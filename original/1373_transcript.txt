n\nRandall is viewing a screenshot of a text-message exchange via his own phone\'s web browser. Such screenshots are frequently posted online, to show content ranging from humorous typos to creepy behavior. In this screenshot, in addition to the text messages\' content, we see a battery bar reflecting a charge of 6%; this effectively "photobombs" (or distracts Randall from) the actual content of the original screenshot. On the other hand, the phone on which the shot is viewed is charged at a healthy 85%.\nThe phone the screenshot is taken from is an iPhone, while the phone being viewed is an Android.\nThe title text suggests that Randall has plugged in his phone to quell the anxiety induced by the 6% charge in the screenshot, mistaking it for the actual battery indicator of his own phone. This measure is obviously unsuccessful, as charging his own phone does nothing to change the charge of the phone in the picture. A similar phenomenon is when a screenshot is viewed and the viewer attempts to use the controls (e.g. buttons) in the image.\nAn alternative interpretation for the title text is that the screenshot was posted as part of a thread asking why their phone isn\'t charging. This would be ironic, as Randall\'s focusing on the battery level means his eyes are being drawn to the very problem being spoken about, yet he is too distracted by it to read that this is the problem!\nThis may also be a reference to mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are according to many neurobiologists a biological basis of empathy. If you see someone stick a needle in their hand, it feels as if you hurt yourself and some people experience a tightness of the chest when hearing a wheezing asthma patient on the radio. Here, Randall\'s mirror neurons start to fire as he feels the anxiety associated with a phone losing battery power.\n\n
