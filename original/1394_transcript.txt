n\nBy depicting how unimpressive the superhero Superman would be if his increase in powers, when compared to humans, were the same as the moon\'s increase in apparent size during a supermoon, Randall points that the use of the term supermoon is an exaggeration.\nThis comic was posted one day after a supermoon, an informal astronomical event where a full moon occurs when it is closest to earth, causing the moon to appear 10% brighter and about 7% larger. This is due to the apsidal precession of moon\'s elliptic orbit which has an orbital eccentricity of about 0.0549. The conditions for a supermoon happen once every 411&#160;days, and the loose definition of the term means that the supermoon lasts for about two or three full moons.\nReturning to the not-so-Superman, the average American adult man is 69&#160;inches tall, with a standard deviation of 2.9&#160;inches. Not-so-Superman, at an assumed 74&#160;inches (188&#160;cm) tall, is within the 94th percentile - certainly a tall man, but by no means phenomenal. Basketball players, for sake of example, range an upwards of 80&#160;inches. "7% stronger" (most likely a reference to how the supermoon is 7% larger) is a bit harder to quantify, but it communicates "not actually impressive" to the reader all the same. For example, if an average man can lift 50&#160;kg, the not-so-Superman would lift 53.5&#160;kg.\nThe comic\'s title makes use of an asterisk that is being used as a wildcard. When using search queries an asterisk represents one or more characters. Therefore, Superm*n can represent the strings "Superman" and "Supermoon".\nThe title text refers  makes this same comparison with Spider-Man. Spider man is capable of firing large amounts of webbing, can cling to surfaces with superhuman gripping abilities, and has a sixth sense, "spider sense", that warns him about impending danger. The title text describes trivially minimal versions of these powers, analogous to the trivial size and brightness difference between a "supermoon" and a normal full moon.\nSupermoon is also referenced in panel 25 of 1052: Every Major\'s Terrible and shortly thereafter in 1080: Visual Field. In both cases displaying the same distaste for the formulation. Although not as clearly as here.\n\n
