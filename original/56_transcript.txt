n\nThe "real face" is that of Robert Smith, best known as the singer of the musical group The Cure, hence the title.\nThe joke in this comic is very simple: When Robert would sing the above lines of Coldplay\'s song "Clocks", fans of his music would know the answer: he\'s part of The Cure.\nIn the title text Randall notes that he has not tried to draw a real face in years, as he mainly do stick drawings. In that way this comic also sticks out. \n\n
