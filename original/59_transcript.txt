n\nMegan and a young Blondie (in her first apperance) discuss their plans after the college. The blonde doesn\'t know what she wants to do with her life, so she is going to go to grad school. Graduate school is the next level of education after undergraduate work, where students pursue a master\'s or doctoral degrees.\nMegan, on the other hand, has decided to become a lighthouse operator, a path that has become increasingly less traveled. Fewer people need lighthouses. Before GPS technology, lighthouses were invaluable markers of where the sea ended and where land began. Megan likes the idea of being the maid in the highest tower. Except where most fairy tales portray the maid in the tower as helpless, waiting to be rescued, operating a lighthouse is far from helpless. It can be one of the most needed jobs for sea-farers to find their way safely back home.\nOther comics with a similar theme about finding or taking unexplored paths, instead of fitting into the mold, includes 137: Dreams and 267: Choices: Part 4.\nScott appears to be a friend of Randall Munroe. Comics 57 through 59 all have the title text Opening dialogue by Scott, forming a sort of informal mini-series inspired by him. They are:\n\n57: Wait For Me\n58: Why Do You Love Me?\n59: Graduation\n\nAs there already was a comic released on Monday that week, the first of these three were released already on Tuesday, then Wednesday and Friday. This may be related to the fact that this was the first week were the comics were not also released on LiveJournal.\n\n
