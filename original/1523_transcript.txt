n\nAmazon Prime Air is a conceptual drone-based delivery system currently in development by Amazon.com. While on one level he thinks the idea is cool, Cueball worries about living in a sci-fi dystopia, with those drones flying all around him, tracking his actions, etc. In the third panel, Megan suggests to send a message to Congress, suggesting a law for making the stealing of drones legal. This would alleviate the problem of drones flying around everywhere because if they did people would catch them to use for themselves. In the final panel Megan begins to search for butterfly nets so they are ready to catch the microdrones when the law to make it legal to steal the drones goes through.\nThis tactic may not work as well as planned; drones will likely simply fly higher or employ other security measures since there are no regulations on drone behavior.\nThe title text suggests one of four things:\n\nAmazon is out of stock of butterfly nets due to everyone purchasing them to catch drones with, implying many people had the same idea like Megan.\nAmazon doesn\'t want people stealing their drones, so the nets are just suspiciously "unavailable".\nNon-Amazon persons controlling the drones have pre-emptively purchased them all.\nAmazon\'s drones have already become self-aware, and have altered the database in order to prevent their capture.\n\nThe \'sci-fi dystopia\' Cueball is talking about, might be a reference to P.K Dick\'s \'Vulcan\'s Hammer\', in which the earth in the year 2029 is surrounded by black flying hammers all around humanity.\nAmazon drones is also the subject of the title text in 1625: Substitutions 2 and there are two quadcopters over the volcano lake in 1608: Hoverboard.\n\n
