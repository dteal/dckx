n\nUranium is stated to have 76 million MJ/kg, while the next highest material shown on the graph (gasoline) has 46 MJ/kg. Thus the uranium graph should be taller by a factor of 76,000,000/46 = 1.652 million. So, if the gasoline graph were 9mm in height, the uranium graph should be a bit more than 14.868 million mm tall, or nearly 15&#160;km (9.2 miles) tall. Thus the need to fold the paper.\nIt should be noted that the method of extracting energy from the first 4 materials (combustion) is completely different from the method used with uranium (nuclear fission). If the technology existed to use nuclear fusion, then the first 4 materials would yield a higher energy density than uranium.\nA log scale is a way of showing largely unequal data sizes in a comprehensible way, using an exponential function between each notch on the y axis of a graph. So for example the first on a Y axis of a graph using a log-10-scale would be 1, then 10, then 100 and 1000 for the fourth. A log/logarithmic function is the inverse of a corresponding exponential function.\nThe log scale can also be abused to make data look more uniform than it really is. On a log scale the energy density of uranium would look larger than that of the other materials, but not dramatically so. The joke is that if one wanted to make their point "properly," they would go ahead and use ridiculous amounts of paper to show the difference between bars using a non-logarithmic scale; this method would focus more on the shock factor of the differences in question, and less on actual communication/representation of data. Cueball seems to be passionate about the MJ/kg of uranium, so he would rather demonstrate the grandeur of the data than use a more efficient scale.\nSee these examples for well known day-to-day measurements which are measured on a log-scale.\nThe title text mentions computer scientist Donald Knuth; the fictional notation is a parody of Knuth\'s up-arrow notation. Using paper thickness as the basis for a log scale would probably give the exponential function a very large base. However, it can be noted that Knuth\'s up-arrow notation can handle numbers far, far larger than this paper stack notation; for example the number 3\xe2\x86\x91\xe2\x86\x91\xe2\x86\x913, very compact in up-arrow notation, would require a number of iterations pinned to the stack on the order of several trillion. 3\xe2\x86\x91\xe2\x86\x91\xe2\x86\x91\xe2\x86\x913 would require a number of iterations that is not only too large to write down, but attempting to write that number using the same paper stack notation would require printing off a second stack of several trillion iterations just to hold the number pinned to the first stack.\nIt should be noted that Randall has used log scales in past comics.\n\n
