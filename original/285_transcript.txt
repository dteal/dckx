n\nCueball holds up a sign showing Citation needed during a political speech. The sign text is a Wikipedia template placed next to a statement that needs a citation&#91;citation needed&#93;, usually because of questionable validity. Cueball is obviously using this template to challenge the politician\'s speech.\nThe title text references semi-protection, a protection measure typical of Wikipedia, which basically protects some content from being anonymously edited.\nYou may also notice that all &#91;citation needed&#93; links, assuming they do not actually lead to a citation, redirect back here.\n\n
