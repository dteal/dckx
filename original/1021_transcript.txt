n\nThis one has the art and feel of very early xkcd comics, even when those stick figures did not appear by that time. Beret Guy\'s "business plan" is to attract gulls with pieces of bread and then trick people into putting their money in his container to purchase them.\nThe title text is a reference to the phrase "Elevator pitch", which is also similar to "investor pitch". The point of an elevator pitch is to have a synopsis of your idea that you are capable of delivering on a moment\'s notice in the time it takes to ride the elevator, about 30 seconds. This way, when you get that once-in-a-career opportunity to pitch your plan to the one person who can make it happen because you just happened to catch the same elevator, you are ready. The reason the elevator pitch is so simplistic is because the same sort of person that would think selling seagulls is a viable business model is likely the same sort of person to make a childish elevator pitch. This also pokes fun at the idea of people sweating over their pitch with such seriousness, when Beret Guy\'s pitch is literally a childish exclamation. Wheeee!\n\n
