n\nThis strip uses a play on the homophonic relationship between "canon", the literary term, and "cannon", a projectile weapon. The word headcannon is a compound of "head" and "cannon".\nIn this strip, Black Hat tells Cueball that he has a "new headcannon". Cueball, thinking Black Hat means "headcanon" (an unjustified belief or theory about a fictional universe), inquires what Black Hat\'s new idea is. Instead of the expected idea or theory, Black Hat removes his hat to reveal a tiny cannon on his head which blows away Cueball and his computer desk.\nWhile headcanon may often be ignored or dismissed as a personal theory, a headcannon would be far harder to ignore, as it is a physical object which has a notable (and in this case violent) impact on the real world. \nIn the title text Randall makes the spellings of these two words indistinguishable by using three consecutive "n"s to spell "headcannnon". Therefore, the title text is deliberately vague. It could be interpreted that it is easy to convince people that you have a cannon on your head, that it is easy to make people believe in a self invented headcanons, or both. Since you are choosing your own interpretation of this title text, the joke is that you are creating your own headcanon.\nThis comic also shows Cueball being once again distracted from his work in a manner similar to 1388: Subduction License.\n\n
