n\nTwo members of a team are designing a robot for the 2010 FIRST Robotics Competition, in which teams design robots to push soccer balls into their team\'s goals. The final design for this team\'s robot is a trailer with a matchbook on a telescoping pole and the actual robot, a mobile platform with an umbrella on top and pusher in front.\nThis is an underhanded design, exploiting the presence of a heat-activated sprinkler system at the venue and lack of water resistance in the opposing team\'s equipment.\nWhen the event starts, the robot moves off and deploys its umbrella. The trailer extends its arm, causing a lit match to set off the sprinkler, which causes the opposing robots to short out and malfunction. This causes the umbrella-protected robot to score goals without opposition.\nThis may also be referencing how FIRST is famous for its bending of the rules, as loopholes are not only not against the rules, they are encouraged. This would be shown best by how Team 67 designed a robot that utilized a loophole, which allowed them to control a robot using an Xbox Kinect during the time where the robot is supposed to be autonomous. (This loophole has been removed in the rules for more recent competitions.)\nThe title text is an excuse presented by the umbrella robot team, presumably because they won but are facing disqualification. This excuse seems weak because none of the venues have a rooftop pool. The comment "the pool on the roof must\'ve sprung a leak" is a quote from the 1995 movie "Hackers".\n\n
