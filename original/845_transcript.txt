n\nWar reenactment is a hobby in which people act out a battle from some previous time period. Theoretical "real-time" war reenactment takes this one step further by having someone act out a war that is actually happening at the time.\nThe title text refers to how someone would research the character that someone would play in a normal war reenactment in order for a more enjoyable reenactment. Once again, the title text makes a real-time version of this, having someone actually live the life of the real-time fighter.\n\n
