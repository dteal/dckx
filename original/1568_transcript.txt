n\n\nThis comic is a continuation of 1563: Synonym Movies with a new set of movie series. As with the previous comic, the titles aren\'t always direct synonyms with the original (Indiana Jones as Professor Whip), but now it seems to be even more exaggerated, sometimes making synonyms of the plot synopsis instead of the subtitle ("Vitamin Water" refers to the Fountain of Youth rather than the Stranger Tides).\nThis set includes Wandboy (Harry Potter), Puncher (Rocky), Tropical Boaters (Pirates of the Caribbean), and Professor Whip (Indiana Jones).\nThe is in Another Movie title in the Professor Whip series differs from the other titles in that it does not reference the plot of the movie. The more dismissive reference may be due to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull being poorly received by fans of the series.\nThe title text is a reference to the TV series A Game of Thrones, based on the book series A Song of Ice and Fire.\n\n
