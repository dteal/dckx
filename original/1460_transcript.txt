n\nRandall gives some examples of confusing acronyms that closely resemble more commonly-used acronyms. He depicts Cueball apparently puzzling over the meaning of one such acronym.\n"SMFW", the title of the comic and an acronym used as the caption, is very close to a number of other common acronyms, including:\n\n"SFW", meaning "safe/suitable for work", denoting that something does not have suggestive content\n"MFW", meaning "my face when...", setting up for a user\'s reaction to something: possibly the intended replacement for the caption at the bottom of the comic\n"SMH", meaning "shaking my head", used to indicate dismay\n"SMF", meaning "so much fun"\n"NSFW", meaning "not safe for work", the opposite of "SFW"\n"MWF", meaning "Monday, Wednesday, Friday", the update schedule of XKCD\n\nThe title text contains more examples of imaginary acronyms of a similar nature:\n\n"WTFW" is a combination of "WTF" ("What the fuck?") and "TFW" ("That feel when...", used in a similar nature to "MFW"), and possibly "FTW" ("For The Win") and "FWIW" ("For What It\'s Worth")\n"SMHO" is a combination of "SMH" ("shake my head") and "IMHO" ("In my humble/honest opinion..."), and possibly "LMAO" ("Laughing My Ass Off")\n"TBFH" is a combination of "TBF" ("to be fair") and "TBH" ("to be honest"), also similar to "BOFH" ("Bastard Operator From Hell")\n"IMDB" is, of course, the Internet Movie Database, but also resembles "IMHO" ("in my humble opinion")\n\nBelow are possible examples of potential (already existing, albeit rare) representations for each acronym, according to the Urban Dictionary:\n\nSMFW is listed as an acronym for "Smoke more fucking weed".\nWTFW is listed as an acronym for "What the fuck, what?".\nSMHO is listed as an acronym for "Shaking my head off".\nTBFH is listed as an acronym for "To be fucking honest".\n\nKnowing Randall, the sentence is (probably) not supposed to make sense, but there are some mildly-plausible translations if one discounts IMDB, which is only there to make an already obnoxious sentence completely absurd. One way would be "What the fuck, what? It\'s like shaking my head off, to be fucking honest." Another possible interpretation includes: "See [or So,] My Face When (SMFW)" and "What the fuck, world? (WTFW) It\'s like so many horrible options (SMHO), to be fucking honest (TBFH) I\'m done; bye. (IMDB)"\nThe name of the comic "XKCD" is itself a false acronym.  From the xkcd about page:\n"It\'s not actually an acronym. It\'s just a word with no phonetic pronunciation -- a treasured and carefully-guarded point in the space of four-character strings."\n\n
