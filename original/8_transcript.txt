n\nThe early comics often feature a style different to what would become the signature xkcd stick-figure style. This comic is the first in an arc of comics, spaced out over 3 years (so far) in which Red Spiders are seen attacking humans. Its objective is not to be funny, philosophical or scientifically interesting; it just tells a story, in a Questionable Content-type way.\nThe full series of Red Spiders:\n\n8: Red spiders (this one)\n43: Red Spiders 2, in which the spiders begin building.\n47: Counter-Red Spiders, in which the humans begin a counter-offensive.\n126: Red Spiders Cometh, in which the spiders attack a city.\n427: Bad Timing, in which, in a style more typical to xkcd, the spiders attack a couple in the middle of a serious relationship discussion in a hot-air balloon.\n442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel, in which it appears briefly in the 14th panel crawling over a cube\n\n
