n\nMost common cook times are given in either whole, half, or quarter minute increments; e.g., 2:00 min. or 1:30 min, meaning that 1,2,3,4,5 and 0 are the most used digits on the microwave, and to use numbers like 6,7,8, or 9, one would have to cook something for that number of minutes. Cueball, however, feels bad for the under-used number \'9,\' so he microwaves his food for one minute fifty-nine seconds instead of two minutes, as a one-second difference is negligible.\nAlso, in Randall\'s book Thing Explainer, every number from one to ten are in the top thousand most used words except nine, which is labeled \'the number after eight.\' This evidences how the other numbers are used much more than nine.\nThe title text is reminiscent of comic 245: Floor Tiles.\n\n
