n\nCueball on the right is talking to his (Cueball-like) friend about dreaming but using words and phrases to make dreaming sound much more dramatic than we usually think that it is. Although the description is completely correct.\nRandall is using the comic to make a point about how we think dreaming is so normal, but if we actually realize what\'s happening, dreaming is very strange:\n\ngo comatose for a few hours = sleep for a few hours\nhallucinate vividly = dream\nsuffer amnesia about the whole experience = forget the dream\n\nThe character on the left takes this as though the experience is normal. Which it indeed is, but that is why Randall has the caption above the guys: Sometimes it seems bizarre to me that we take dreaming in stride.\nThe title text is about lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is aware that he or she is dreaming. This is even more fascinating to Randall. He uses this type of dream in 269: TCMP.\n\n
