n\nWayne Coyne, the lead singer of the band The Flaming Lips, is indeed known to crowd-surf in a giant hamster ball.\nHamster balls are a recurring subject on xkcd, starting with 152: Hamster Ball, which in direct relation to this comic showed that Cueball\'s biggest and only wish is such a ball.\nWhen Cueball\'s Cueball-like friend tells him about Wayne\'s hamster ball surfing Cueball says "Let\'s go", suggesting they should go and steal that hamster ball from Wayne. \nThe rest of the comic outlines an elaborate mission to acquire a human-sized hamster ball by infiltrating a music concert and stealing the hamster ball while it is in use, thus also kidnapping the rock star, who would be structurally powerless to fight back while trapped within a spherical object. At least four Cueball-like guys help with the mission at the concert, one keeping the crowd back and the other three pushing the hamster ball into the waiting truck where a fifth friend acts as the driver when they escape with their heist.\nThe title text is one of Randall\'s many open promises. It almost certainly has not been fulfilled, but people may have attempted to kidnap Wayne Coyne. He is very friendly though and will supply both the one who brings him the hamster ball with a t-shirt as well as give one to Wayne...\nIt is later revealed in 577: The Race: Part 1, that Cueball paid a large settlement for this heist.\n\n
