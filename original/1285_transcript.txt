n\nThis comic refers to the debate occurring in the United States about the correct number of space characters after the end of a sentence.\nWhile text written on typewriters in the United States traditionally had two spaces between sentences, this is becoming less common and many sources now recommend having only one space, although this topic is still controversial.\nCueball is advocating a line break after every sentence, the eponymous "third way", and sometimes called "semantic linefeeds".\nThis is particularly useful when plain text files based on a markup language (such as HTML, TeX, or Wiki markup) are edited by multiple people using a version control system where it helps to facilitate comparison of changes and avoid merge conflicts.\nIn most markup languages, a single linefeed in the source is rendered as a simple space, while two linefeeds generate a paragraph break.\nThis approach allows the source to be easily manipulated and versioned, while the rendered output still keeps the regular flow and justification abilities of running text.\nThe title text uses single spaces between the back-and-forth quotations; but within each quotation, the quoted speaker\'s preferred spacing is used.\nIn particular, when the single-spacing advocate claims to be using double spacing, this is indeed a lie.\nHowever, realistically, it is implausible that one can hear whitespace.\nSentence spacing was previously mentioned in the titletext of 1070: Words for Small Sets.\nNote that this is not the first time Randall has proposed a controversial third way.\nRandall\'s mocking characterization in the title text of overzealous advocates using the phrase "WAKE UP, SHEEPLE" has appeared in previous comics 496: Secretary: Part 3 and 1013: Wake Up Sheeple.\n\n
