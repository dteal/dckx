n\nFidgeting while talking on the telephone is a very common habit and may manifest as doodling or pacing. In the case of the person speaking off-panel (presumably Cueball), he paces while absent-mindedly moving random objects around the house. Taking this behavior to the extreme, he has also erected an obelisk in the backyard and carved prayers to "Ba\'al, the Soul Eater" on it. This may be a reference to the saying "Idle hands are the devil\'s playthings."\nThe title text suggests that the "fidgeting" is just a cover story - the off-panel speaker is actually worshipping (or possessed by) Ba\'al, and is casually trying to encourage Megan to do the same.\nBa\'al, or Baal, refers to one of many deities and demons which go by this name. Given its title "The Soul Eater", it probably refers to Beelzebub (one of the seven princes of hell). Ba\'al, the Soul Eater has been mentioned in 1246: Pale Blue Dot and 1638: Backslashes.\n\n
