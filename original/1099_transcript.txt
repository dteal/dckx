n\nBeret Guy and at least one other person (Megan) are sitting at a restaurant. The waitress, Ponytail, tells Beret Guy there is a special on Tuesdays for "endless wings". Restaurants often have different daily discounts to encourage people to come in. In a normal restaurant, "endless wings" would presumably refer to "all-you-can-eat" chicken wings, meaning the customer can pay a flat price and eat all the chicken wings they want without having to pay any more.\nHowever, in this comic, Beret Guy tells the waitress that he already has "endless wings", which he means literally (similar issues of things being taken literally is referenced in 1086: Eyelash Wish Log and 1528: Vodka) and Beret Guy begins growing wings which ultimately appear "endless" as they grow to a span of at least the circumference of the Earth by the last panel (and presumably continue growing). The other characters scream in horror for obvious&#91;citation needed&#93; reasons.\nThe title text plays on another common restaurant offer of "bottomless drinks", meaning unlimited free refills of drinks. However, falling into something literally bottomless (i.e. without a bottom) would result in falling forever. (However, even this is unlikely unless the diameter of the cups that the drinks are served in is large enough to fit a whole person into.) If it was literally "bottomless", you would start to decelerate as you pass the earth\'s center of mass. The air pressure and heat in a "bottomless" pit would also be fatal to humans.\n\n
