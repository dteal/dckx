n\nCueball wants to take Megan out for his idea of a cultural experience; a symphony. The inference is that Megan\'s culturally impoverished because "all she ever listens to is techno". After much griping on various levels, for instance complaining that all the other attending is above 60 years old, she starts to get into the experience \xe2\x80\x94 sort of. The big \'cultural lesson\' she (mis-)gleans from the experience is similar to what a sporting aficionado would gain from watching a sports event. So it could be said that Cueball\'s mission to culture was a mission impossible in Megan\'s case.\nHer observation regards the seating configuration of a typical modern orchestra, in which the violinists all sit audience-left, while the violists, cellists and bassists, with clearly larger instruments, are on the right. But it is not the size of an instrument that determines the payroll of a musician.\nThe title text is just icing on the cake. A sampler is an instrument frequently used in techno music that samples other sounds and plays them back, usually electronically altered. Remixing is a process, also often used in techno, of editing recorded music to get a different sound. Many classical pieces have had success as techno remixes. One example is Pachelbel\'s Canon in D major, referred to in the title text of 339: Classic.\nThree of the old people in the line look very similar to the old people in 572: Together. In the very next comic 587: Crime Scene a man is again shown with hair only around his neck.\n\n
