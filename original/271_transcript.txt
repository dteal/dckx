n\nThis is a parody of the short documentary "Powers of 10", which can be found here.\nAs in the documentary, the comic features a man and a woman having a picnic on a blanket. In the documentary, the apparent distance from the scene, and thus the zoom level, gradually changes by a factor of ten every ten seconds (hence the name "Powers of 10": 1, 10, 100, ...). In the comic, powers of one are used. Since all powers of 1 are 1, the image doesn\'t change at all, showing a series of identical images.\nThe title text notes that this idea may seem profound (or "Zen", which is commonly used in American slang to mean "profound"), but is not upon scrutiny.\n\n
