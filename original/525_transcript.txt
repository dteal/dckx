n\nCueball occasionally says "I know you\'re listening" aloud in empty rooms. The idea is, that if nobody is listening he doesn\'t lose anything, but if somebody is listening he gains by freaking them out. In this case another Cueball-like surveillance man does get quite the shock.\nAs mentioned in the title text, this is similar to Pascal\'s Wager. Blaise Pascal was a French philosopher and mathematician who discussed the issue of the possibility that God actually does exist or not. According to Pascal, a rational person should believe in God because he wouldn\'t lose anything if this is wrong, but if this belief is correct he would gain immensely by going to heaven at his afterlife due to being a Christian. The argument works equally well for any and all gods, but doesn\'t give any reason to choose one over the other, so it seems unlikely that Pascal\'s Wager has ever changed anybody\'s religious views. One important way Cueball\'s wager is different from Pascal\'s is that Cueball can choose to engage in paranoid pranks, but belief is not something that one can possess simply by choice.\nThis comic has a clear resemblance to the My Hobby series. This would also make it clear the Cueball in this comic is actually Randall.\n\n
