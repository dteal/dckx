n\nThis comic references a long-running ad campaign for Geico insurance in which a character (different in each commercial) lists a series of horrible events or news, but then caps it off with "but I\'ve got good news: I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico" \xe2\x80\x93 news which may be good, but is usually either trivial compared to the magnitude of the preceding bad news, or else is said to the person whom all of the preceding bad news applied to, giving them false hope that the good news was for them. It became a recognizable pop culture phrase. Geico\'s ad is also mentioned in 870: Advertising\nIn this one-panel comic, Cueball parodies the punchline by saving money on his car insurance by intimidation, instead of choosing the best provider.\nIn the title text Randall attributes this comic to the unknown friend David. He does the same in 51: Malaria and 100: Family Circus. We can assume (or rather, we can hope) that "this" refers to the act of writing the comic, as opposed to the act of threatening his insurance agent.\n\n
