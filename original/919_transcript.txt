n\nApparently Randall hates some ridiculous neologisms. Cueball seems to be dictating a "Tween bromance" story or novel to Megan, who is possibly typing it up. He is including all the words that get to Megan in a sequence. Megan is just annoyed and starts to shriek in rage; considering Cueball keeps speaking more annoying words in the title text, that seems to have been the point.\n\n"Tween" means a pre-adolescent. Portmanteau of teen and between, specifically between the ages of nine (9) and thirteen (13).\n"Bromance" means a close non-sexual friendship between two males. Portmanteau of brother and romance.\n"Guesstimate" means an estimate made with very little information. Portmanteau of guess and estimate.\n"Frenemy" means a mixture of a friend and a rival. Portmanteau of friend and enemy.\n"Yiff" is a word invented by the furry community. In most contexts it simply means "fornicate", supposedly derived from the sound a fox makes during mating.\n"moist" is an ordinary word, but one that many people find mildly creepy, especially in this context.\n"Taint" is the part between the genitals and the anus (perineum) in slang.\n"Panties" is a common term in the U.S. for women\'s underwear.\n"Preggers" a slang term for being pregnant.\n"verbiage" is a fairly new usage of an older word, meaning too many words used to explain a subject.\n"Va-jay-jay" /v\xc9\x99\xcb\x88j\xc4\x81j\xc4\x81/ IPA /v\xc9\x99\xcb\x88d\xca\x92e\xc9\xaad\xca\x92e\xc9\xaa/ is just a way of saying "vagina".\n"Irregardless" is a solecism. Or perhaps this portmanteau.\n\nLike this comic fills a sentence with (gross) neologisms, 550: Density crams a sentence with memes.\nAccording to 1485: Friendship, Randall doesn\'t like the word bromance much either.\n\n
