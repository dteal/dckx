n\nReverse Polish notation is a method of writing mathematical expressions, where operators are after their operands, not between. For example, 2 + 2 becomes 2 2 +, and (2 \xc3\x97 2) / 3 becomes 2 2 * 3 /. This comic plays on that, by placing a Polish Sausage (a North American term for Kielbasa) after both halves of the bun instead of between.\nThe title text is a pun on the fact that Reverse Polish Notation is also known as Postfix notation. "Fixins" is a Southern US slang for condiments such as mustard, chopped onions, and more. The slang is derived from how you "fix" up, or prepare, your food item whenever you have items that can be customized per person after being cooked.\nThe news section for this comic says "Comic today\'s you confuses here click if", which is also written in some kind of reverse polish notation and would be "If today\'s comic confuses you, click here" in proper English.\n\n
