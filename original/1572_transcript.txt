n\nAs the comic image states, it links to a survey created with Google Forms, containing a series of questions. The questions range from mundane typical survey questions such as \xe2\x80\x9cDo you have any food allergies?\xe2\x80\x9d, to rather strange, such as \xe2\x80\x9cFill this text box with random letters by randomly mashing keys on your keyboard.\xe2\x80\x9d (See 1530: Keyboard Mash).\nThe stated goal of the survey is to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate an interesting and unusual data set for people to play with\xe2\x80\x9d. A strange data set is a ripe opportunity for a sampling of readers. It\'s also supposed to be \xe2\x80\x9ca search for weird correlations\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 presumably the goal is to be able to say things like \xe2\x80\x9cpeople who have been skydiving are (more/less) likely than average to dislike cilantro\xe2\x80\x9d. (See also 882: Significant about finding presumably-spurious correlations between unrelated data.)\nThis explanation will undoubtedly expand when the data comes in.\nHTML image maps is a technique for marking up areas of an image on a web page, such that each area can be a link without the whole image being a link. Randall could have used this type of image map to make only the \xe2\x80\x9cClick here to take the survey\xe2\x80\x9d button be a link, and none of the rest of the image. But he cannot get the hang of it (or knowing his skills, does not wish to take the time to learn it). Not getting the hang of HTML image maps was also referenced on the banner for his book tour from September 2014\nThe title text is a joke off of Big Data, which is a name for analysis of a set of data that includes a huge amount of information. He also says "for a big planet" because the Earth is big.&#91;citation needed&#93;\nThe survey is closed, and the questions replaced with the text: "The xkcd survey is now closed. Thank you for all your answers! Response data is being collected and will be posted soon." As of 17 July 2016, the same caption is still there, with no indication of exactly how soon the data is intended to be posted. (Apparently, Randall crashed google forms, so the data is taking a long time to be retrieved (see this reddit thread) - much like his breaking of Wolfram Alpha] during answering a reader\'s question on what if?)\n\n
