A transcript for this large drawing is also needed as there are many words and they are not easy to discern all of them.If you can address this issue, please edit the page! Thanks.\n\nThis comic is the 1000th comic shown on xkcd containing 1000 characters from previous comics arranged in the shape of the number "1000". Megan is clearly excited as she screams "Woooo!", but Cueball, in true nerd fashion, thinks in base 2, saying that there are "just 24 to go until a big round-number milestone". The joke is that during programming, base two is used more often than base 10, making milestones be powers of two rather than powers of 10. Where 1000 is a round number in base 10 (103), 1024 is a round number in base 2 (210).\nIn the 1000 comic Randall included 404: Not Found, see why in the explanation for this comic. This comic strengthens the fact that Randall did indeed count 404 as a "real" comic. \n\n
