n\nThis strip refers to Jurassic World, the new Jurassic Park movie. White Hat explains to Megan that the movie\'s plot involves genetically engineering a better Tyrannosaurus. Megan doesn\'t feel that the historic Tyrannosaurus can be improved upon, but White Hat insists they\'ve created an even more terrifying, smarter Tyrannosaurus for this new movie.\nWhite Hat refers to Tyrannosaurus as "two decades old", indicating that he has switched topics from the movie\'s plot line to the animation techniques that created the Tyrannosaurus on-screen in 1993 versus today. Clearly, in the computer animation world, we should be able to create something more convincing with modern technology.\nIn the final panel, White Hat introduces the "new" Tyrannosaurus, who is immediately recognizable as the green Tyrannosaurus from Ryan North\'s Dinosaur Comics; specifically, from the last panel of said webcomic - which in turn is from clip art. Anyone who has read so much as a handful of Dinosaur Comics will know that its Tyrannosaurus character "T-Rex" is about as far from smart and scary as it is possible for a Tyrannosaurus to be. See this example from the day this comic was released.\nThe title text is an example of what T-Rex (the character) would say to a couple of humans, and it\'s a very poor joke, which would only be fun when it\'s a talking T-Rex saying it. Despite his goofy mannerisms, he is still a carnivore who attacks humans as can be seen in panel 3 and 4 of the webcomic.\nThe entire Dinosaur Comics was parodied in 145: Parody Week: Dinosaur Comics, where Randall copied the drawings himself, and T-Rex has appeared in one of the story lines in 1350: Lorenz (see this example story line and also the Dinosaur section under Lorenz themes), where the actual images from the first three panels of Ryan\'s comic are used, just like here where it is the last panel which is used.\n\n
