n\nThe comic begins with a grainy, pencil-drawing of Megan on a ship. This is a clue that things are not as they appear.\nAs the point-of-view pulls back in each successive frame, we see that "Megan on a ship" is really a thought-bubble belonging to Cueball, who is sitting at his desk. He apparently is day-dreaming instead of working. Note that this is presented in the standard, crisp format, as if drawn on a computer. This suggests it shows us our "normal" view.\nHowever, as the perspective continues to pull back, we see that "Cueball thinking of Megan" is actually a thought-bubble belonging to Megan. In the final frames, the ship sails out of frame. However, since the final frames are in the same grainy pencil-drawing format, it suggests that this is still Cueball\'s thoughts, rather than an actual image of Megan.\nThe title text, "Or so I hope", shows us what this recursion really means: Cueball hopes that Megan realizes that he misses her, but suggests he\'s not entirely certain she does.\n\n
