n\nThe comic refers to "Hungry Bitches", a 2007 scat-fetish pornographic film. The one-minute preview, unofficially nicknamed "2 Girls 1 Cup", is a viral video that became a well-known internet meme. It is therefore not surprising that only the input combination of x=2 and y=1 generates a significant number of search results, being 257 times as frequent as the runner-up "1 Girl 1 Cup".\nThe cells in the table with zero hits are white. From 1 to 9 they are yellow and above that they are orange - except the maximum which is red. As the second largest count is below 10,000 (7503) and the maximum almost two million it is impossible to say if the red color is reserved for the maximum or for any number above a given value say from ten thousand or up to above a million hits.\nThe title text suggests other combinations like 1 girl to 10,000 cups (very large number of cups to one girl), 2 girls to (5+3i) cups (a complex number), 65536 girls to 65536 cups (216, the first integer than can\'t be represented as a two-byte unsigned integer) and finally 3 French hens and 2 turtle doves to 1 cup. All phrases with apparently no search results. \nThe last phrase is a reference to the song The Twelve Days of Christmas. After the publication of this comic, the phrase has been cross-posted at various sites in order to generate search results and prove the statement in the title text wrong. The same has happened to other entries as often happens shortly after Randall posts something regarding Google searches.\n\n
