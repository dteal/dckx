n\nBeret Guy comments on a baseball game using improper terminology in a way that demonstrates that he does not understand how the game is played. Moreover, his na\xc3\xafve way of speaking reveals that he is not aware of his lack of knowledge and does not consider it possible that, as is probably the case, his audience is much more familiar with this sport and its rules. His unworldly way of talking makes one even wonder if he has any notion of the way people experience sports at all. His choice of terminology is reminiscent of 1133: Up Goer Five in that he names things using simplified terms that he feels best describes their function like "thrower", "second pillow" or "thrower jail". His commentary is a combination of mistaken terms and misunderstandings of the rules and principles of the game.\n\n\n\nSpoken Text\n\n Corrected "Translation"\n\n Explanation\n\n\n"We\'re on part 5 of a hitting game."\n\n"We\'re in the 5th inning of a baseball game."\n\nPart of baseball is hitting the ball with the bat. A baseball game is divided into rounds called innings, with each team getting a chance to bat.\n\n\n"The next guy has a big bat, so he\'ll probably hit the ball real far."\n\n --\n\nThis is a simply a misunderstanding that the size of a bat will determine the strength of the hit. Every hitter uses a bat that fits his physique, within certain limits in the rules. In general, the size of a bat is not a significant factor on the ball\'s distance. The limits in the rules generally prevent any sort of advantage gained by the size of the bat.\n\n\n"Wait - he missed!" "Oh good, they\'re letting him try again."\n\n"Swing and a miss." "Here comes the second pitch..."\n\nThe goal in baseball for the fielding team is to get three outs to end the inning. One way to get an out is for the pitcher to get the batter to accumulate three strikes for a strikeout. A pitch that goes through the strike zone but is not swung at is counted as a strike, as is any ball that is swung at but missed. A foul ball (a ball hit into an out-of-play area) also counts as a strike unless it would be the third strike. In this case, the batter swung at and missed the first pitch, and so has one strike but not a strikeout, so the hitter is allowed to "try again".\n\n\n"The people sitting on the chair shelves are yelling at this guy but he\'s ignoring them. Wow. Rude."\n\n"The fans in the bleachers are heckling the batter, but he\'s keeping his focus on the game."\n\nCheering and heckling is so commonplace that the players on the field are unlikely to react to it. While some might think the cheering and heckling to be rude, Beret Guy is amazed at the batter\'s rudeness in ignoring those who are yelling at him.\n\n\n"This thrower is good! He keeps making people leave by throwing balls at them."\n\n"This pitcher is good! He keeps striking out batters." OR "This pitcher keeps walking batters!" These could be mixed.\n\nBeret Guy may be indicating that the pitcher has struck out several batters. Batters who are out return to the dugout and the next batter replaces them. On the other hand, given Beret Guy\'s lack of baseball knowledge, it\'s possible that the pitcher has walked batters which would result in the batters leaving the batter\'s box and going to first base. Beret Guy could be considering this "making people leave".\n\n\n"It\'s just him, though. None of his teammates are joining in."\n\n"There are so few hits in this game that only the pitcher needs to throw. None of the fielders need to do anything".\n\nThe other players of the team do not pitch. Their role while fielding is to get outs if the ball is hit. If the pitcher is either striking out or walking batters, the fielders (other than the catcher) would not generally be involved in the play.\n\n\n"That guy just ran to the second pillow when no one was looking!!"\n\n"The runner stole second base."\n\nAny baserunner (a player standing at a base) can attempt to run to the next base before or while the pitcher delivers a pitch (called stealing a base). The pitcher can throw the ball to one of his teammates to tag out the runner before he reaches the next base. Thus, an attempt to steal a base is most successful if no one notices.\nThe "second pillow" implies that the runner in question stole second base, which is the most commonly stolen base. However, someone who knows little to nothing about baseball, such as Beret Guy in this case, may not be aware which bases are considered "first", "second", and "third", since the bases are not laid out linearly. The fact that there was a runner to steal a base suggests that one of the batters was indeed walked (or got a hit that was not mentioned).\n\n\n\n"Everyone\'s real mad but I guess they checked the rules and there\'s nothing that says he can\'t do that. Yikes. Hopefully they can fix that once the game is over."\n\n"The fans are yelling..."\n\nA stolen base by the visiting team may be met with anger from the fans. A stolen base by either team may cause the other team to be angry. Beret Guy, not knowing the rules of baseball, seems to find it odd that the runner is allowed to steal a base and seems surprised that there is no rule against it. He suggests it\'s a loophole that hopefully the league will fix once they\'ve learned of the stolen base. In reality, the players, fans and league would be well aware of the legality of stealing a base. Beret Guy\'s phrasing may be a reference to 1552: Rulebook.\n\n\nTitle text: "The thrower started hitting the bats too much, so the king of the game told him to leave and brought out another thrower from thrower jail."\n\n"The batters were getting too many hits, so the manager took the pitcher out of the game and called in a reliever from the bullpen."\n\nIf the batters are getting too many hits, it may mean that the pitcher has become tired and less effective or that the batters are learning the pitcher\'s habits or rhythms. Once this happens, the team\'s manager will typically replace the pitcher with a relief pitcher who will come out of the bullpen (the generally enclosed area next to the playing field where relief pitchers warm up) to join the game. Beret Guy may be mistaking the manager of one team as in charge of the entire game with his term "King of the Game".\n\n
