n\nThis is the second (and last) comic in the Android series, referring directly back to 595: Android Girlfriend, where Cueball showed that he had an android girlfriend Megan. So now Ponytail has decided she would also like to have an android boyfriend, (Hairy). But upon bringing these two androids together, they fall for each other and decide to have "sex" on the spot, resulting in several mechanical sounds off-panel while their "owners" watch on with disgusted interest.\nPart of the joke is that the androids find each other more attractive than the people to whom they were (presumably) created to find attractive. Like likes like, as the saying goes. \nVibrators and Fleshlights are sex toys that represent male and female genitalia, respectively. Ponytail\'s flat description indicates that she is not particularly aroused by what amounts to a pair of animatronic sex toys rubbing against each other. Randall\'s title text claims that he has actually done such a thing, and stuck it on his fireplace mantle for all his house-guests to see. He admits though that it is the most unsettling mantlepiece decoration in my house. References to Fleshlight is a recurring theme in xkcd.\n\n
