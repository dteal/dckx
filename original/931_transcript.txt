n\nxkcd is a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language; humor isn\'t necessarily guaranteed. This comic is an example of that, it being severely depressing.\nThe comic is built around a dialogue between two people (we\'ll say Cueball is the one talking, and the other is his friend) about cancer, presumably cancer that Megan has been diagnosed with. The conversation itself is about as straightforward as a conversation can be. It details the maturation of Cueball\'s and Megan\'s understanding of cancer diagnoses, knowledge which we can presume he has gained, reluctantly, by watching a loved one suffer.\nThis whole cancer series was sparked because Randall\'s then-fiancee, now wife, is currently in Megan\'s position, and we, the readers, are now the beneficiaries of this new understanding of cancer diagnoses without having to watch somebody close to us suffer.\nThe comic\'s title, Lanes, comes from the two panels which illustrate both ends of the spectrum of Cueball\'s mental representation of how cancer treatment proceeds. In that there are many possible outcomes for cancer treatment, the image of a multi-lane freeway seems an apt metaphor to represent this understanding visually.\nIn the first freeway diagram, there are several paths, but the system is very simple, and easy to take in. Only a few lanes lead off into the oblivion which surrounds the freeway, a single off-ramp circles back from the path to survival to treatment, and survival is a visible endpoint.\nIn the second freeway diagram, however, things are much, much more complex, and much more bleak. Even six years out, survival isn\'t visible, and many lanes end in oblivion, sometimes not veering off for years after treatment. The title text informs us that this is meant to be loosely representative of breast cancer stages one through four, proceeding by quarters from left to right. It\'s a grim outlook, hence the friend\'s understated but completely fitting reaction to this plethora of new knowledge.\nSpecific numbers:\n\nThere are 52 lanes, so 13 lanes per cancer stage. \nStage one has a 1:13 =~8% chance of recurrence leading to death within 6 years. \nStage 2 has a 5:13=~38% chance. \nStage 3 has a 7:13=~54% chance. \nStage 4 has an 11:13=~85% chance of death within 6 years. \n\n\nGiven Randall\'s concern, these numbers are probably pretty accurate. Go get a mammogram.\nFuck cancer.\n\n
