n\n\'May you live in interesting times\' (or, in this comic, \'may you have an interesting life\') is supposedly a Chinese saying, except that a few people (usually the worst-case-scenario kind) believe it to actually be a curse, even though it is usually meant in a good way when said. The quote also provides the title of the Terry Pratchett novel Interesting Times, which takes place in a fictional counterpart of China.\nCueball is shown here as an office worker, a job which to most people is the opposite of interesting. This is contrasted with Megan who is rappelling down the outside of his office building, for no apparent reason other than because she can, and inviting him on an adventure. Things are bound to get at least one kind of "interesting" very fast.\nThe title text refers to Cat6 cable, which is more commonly known as Ethernet cable. It would be easily found in an office building, since it is used to connect computers to a network. Its usefulness as climbing rope is indeterminate.&#91;citation needed&#93;\n\n
