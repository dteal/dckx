n\nThe term Trolling is used to describe provocative, destructive or annoying behavior on the Internet. Especially common are Internet pranks of the bait-and-switch type, an example of which is Rickrolling. It involves placing a link that is supposed to contain interesting or funny material, but instead directs to the music video of the 1987 Rick Astley song Never Gonna Give You Up. The prank first occurred in May 2007 on the popular imageboard 4chan and has since become a widespread internet meme.\nThe comic has Black Hat and Cueball digging into the ground and splicing Black Hat\'s computer into the TV cables of Rick Astley\'s house. They are feeding the video of Never Gonna Give You Up into Astley\'s TV signal, who can be seen sitting in his living room and wondering why CNN has been replaced by his own video. The act of Rickrolling Rick Astley himself is declared to be a "great moment in trolling".\nThe title text mentions Goatse.cx (pronounced goat sex), a former shock website that was used in a similar prank. People clicking on the feigned link would instead see the disturbing picture of a practitioner of anal stretching. The title text suggests that Black Hat and Cueball somehow made the (unknown) founder of the site click on an even more shocking link.\nAlso note that the comic image itself is itself a Rickroll. Anyone curious enough as to why their mouse pointer became the selection icon to click on the comic would find themselves watching "Never Gonna Give You Up."\nRick Astley was actually Rickrolled on Tout le Monde en parle, a French Canadian television show.
