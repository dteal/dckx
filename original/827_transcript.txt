n\nMany people have shared Cueball\'s experience of seeing someone else make profit from an idea that they themselves had. This comic plays with the thought of what would happen if intellectual property thinking was taken to an extreme, and if companies or people were more keen on "setting things right" than money. The title text is an extension of the comic with increasingly extreme thinking.\nIn reality, having a great idea alone of course does not create a profitable business; there must generally be an enormous amount of work and effort (not to mention risk-taking) put in to create a business from scratch, popularize it, and keep it standing. Cueball, having done none of this, would probably not deserve close to the "30% cut" he claims even if intellectual property did work the way it is presented here.\nThe delivery guy is from FedEx. 960: Subliminal is about hidden messages in their logo.\nThis comic originally shared name with 1721: Business Idea, but then this comic was renamed. There were no other relations between the ideas for the two comics, see Trivia.\n\n
