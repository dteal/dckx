n\nEveryone wants to help someone in need, but sometimes the help they can offer isn\'t enough, or is the wrong kind of help. Cueball tries to help Megan, who is in psychological/emotional distress, but despite his efforts she ends up in hospital. She may have attempted suicide, but it\'s not very clear. The point is that sometimes you just can\'t make people happy, it\'s something they have to do themselves.\nThe title text refers to a hidden button behind the bookshelf, but Cueball did not find it. This is ironic because, although people can try help with psychological/emotional problems, there is no magic button that makes everything better. Others speculate the "magic button" was what she used to attempt suicide.\nGiven his likely negative feelings towards Valentine\'s Day, as seen in the most of his Valentines comics, it may not be a coincidence that he sent this one out the day before February 14. He did not draw any Valentines Day related comics this year as he did the past two years.\n\n
