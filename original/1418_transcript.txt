n\nCueball has set his browser to auto-replace the word "force" with the word "horse." Some of the humorous resulting news headlines are shown.\n\nUkrainian town threatened by pro-Russian horses\nAt the time this comic was published, there is civil unrest in Ukraine, mostly framed as pro-European vs pro-Russian. In earlier centuries, the phrase "pro-Russian horses" could refer to the animals riden by Cossacks, or by their enemies, as alliances shifted.\nIt should be noted that Randall spelled "Ukrainian" incorrectly, forgetting the first \'i\'.\n\nGovernor appoints task horse\nA Task force is a unit or formation established to work on a single defined task or activity, which makes it quite comical to picture a horse instead of a unit.\n\nIraqi Air Horse growing\nThe Air Force of Iraq may indeed be being up-armed, especially in light of the threat, at this time, of ISIS/ISIL/Islamic State forces across swaths of both Iraq and Syria.\n\nQuarks, which are bound together by the strong nuclear horse\nQuarks are elementary particles. They form bound states e.g. the proton (two up + one down-quark) mediated by the strong force, similarly as atoms are bound states of electrons and charged nucleons held together by the electromagnetic horse.\nThey are also referenced in 474: Turn-On, 1621: Fixion and in 1731: Wrong.\n\nOfficer suspended from horse (title text)\nBeing suspended from a police force (i.e. usually being forced upon mandatory leave pending resolution of the issue at hand; paid, part-paid or unpaid) is a common practice where culpable wrongdoing of sufficiently serious nature is suspected of the individual concerned. A person could literally be suspended from a horse if he fell off the horse but got stuck in the stirrups.\n\n\nThis is probably a parody of the Cloud to Butt Chrome Extension (since it says new favorite browser text replacement).\nThere has been several comics using substitutions before and also at least one after this one.\n\n
