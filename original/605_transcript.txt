n\nThis comic is a joke on the incorrect use of linear extrapolation. By connecting two points without any context, we can come up with incredibly funny results. Here, connecting the number of spouses against yesterday and today can result in a linear extrapolation to hundreds of spouses a year. Cueball presents the accumulation of husbands as though it were a phenomenon beyond the bride\'s ability to control. Using similar points for pregnancy (yesterday: no babies, today: one), we can get 200+ children inside a single person by the 7th month of pregnancy.\nThis is another comic in the infrequent My Hobby series.\nThis particular hobby has later been explored in 1007: Sustainable, 1204: Detail and 1281: Minifigs.\n\n
