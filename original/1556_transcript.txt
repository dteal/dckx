n\nIn this comic Cueball and Megan admire a majestic sky on a beautiful day. This is one of the few comics where the scenery is drawn entirely in color, adding to the feeling of awe and natural wonder. The lighting on the clouds and the night sky in the upper corner suggest that this is either at sunset or sunrise and the picture is drawn to show the ever changing beauty of the many different stages of the sky. When the sun falls below the horizon the light produces many different colors which can often be breathtaking to witness. Similar things happen at sunrise.\nThe pouch shaped cloud formations are called Mammatus clouds and are usually associated with nearing bad weather.\nMegan says that the sky is one of her favorite halves, which is an odd thing to say. There are exactly two halves, so being "one of" her favorite in a set of two items is at best a meaningless statement. The implication is that she quite enjoys this half, but may find the other half equally or more enjoyable; in other words, she likes it all.\nThe title text demonstrates that the other half which is not the sky is the ground, water, and various other things on the Earth. Both of these halves can be beautiful in their own right, and, as the title text points out, if the Earth were to be moved then underneath it would be more sky.\n\n
