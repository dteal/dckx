n\nThe right-hand rule is a mathematics and physics trick to learning how to find the cross product of two Cartesian vectors in three dimensions. First, position your right arm in the direction of the first vector (in the example diagram in the comic, this is to the left). Then, curl your fingers in the direction of the second vector (out of the page/screen, in the example). Now point your thumb perpendicular to the other fingers, and it will point in the direction of the cross product of those two vectors (upwards, in the example). Note that reversing the order of the two vectors also reverses the direction of the cross product.\nThe joke relies on non-standard ways of measuring, which are unusual and much more impractical. To emphasize this, the third method only works for males, provided that he is not impotent, while looking at porn. It\'s a penis joke.\nThe title text refers to Edwin Abbott Abbott, author of the book Flatland, a story about a two dimensional world.\n\n
