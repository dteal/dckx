n\nWe have no rock formations on Earth older than about 3.5 billion years, as the comic points out, because everything solid from before that time has been subducted down into the Earth\'s mantle, by tectonic movement. The title text hints at the cooler Moon which stopped re-melting its surface much sooner, so we theoretically could learn something about Earth\'s history from examining our Moon\'s surface and makeup. Zircons are a type of mineral found in the Earth\'s crust, some of which have been estimated to be as old as 4.4 billion years, older than any other mineral.\nAnyways, here the Earth is anthropomorphized and actively teases the narrator; first it asks the narrator to draw in closer, as if it\'s about to tell us a secret, but then it whispers "I\'ll never tell".\n\n
