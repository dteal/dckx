n\nThe Amazon River in South America is the second longest river in the world and by far the largest by waterflow. Amazon.com is a website that specializes in commerce and selling goods over the internet. The "round 14" suggest they are being compared in different criteria in a sort of competition. With such different systems, we can assume that most of those comparisons were similarly funny. The title text mentions two other criteria of comparison.\nThe measure of flow for the Amazon river (cubic meters per second) indicates the volume of water that passes a given point in the river at any second. To illustrate how much 220,000 cubic meters is, the comic shows a car parked next to 220,000 cubic meters of water. 220,000 cubic meters equals a cube with an edge length of 60.4 meters. By comparison the 0.9 cubic meters (900 l) of goods that are shipped by Amazon.com seems very small (note that 900 liters of goods per second is still a lot). To illustrate this size, the comic shows an Amazonian fish (or possibly an Amazon river dolphin) investigating the packages.\nIquitos and Manaus are cities near the source and middle point respectively of the river; the title text suggests that it is faster to have a package shipped between the two than let it drift downstream. \'Minutes to skeletonize a cow\' refers to piranha, an Amazonian predatory fish with a popular reputation of being capable of the mentioned act when hunting in groups (it should be noted that, while not fictional per se, the legendary cow-killing piranhas had been starved beforehand by local humans).  \nIn 1599: Water Delivery Amazon.com takes the fight against the Amazon to a new level by delivering water within one hour; however, the Amazon River is not mentioned in that comic.\n\n
