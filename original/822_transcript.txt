n\nThe comic starts with Cueball\'s internal dialogue telling him what he\'s been thinking for some time now \xe2\x80\x94 that the girl he\'s looking at is so beautiful she seems unapproachable, and "what could she ever see in a guy like you", and typical fears that a guy has that prevents him from talking to a pretty girl.\nOnly to be interrupted by the girl\'s internal monologue, who introduces herself to Cueball\'s internal monologue and asks if he\'d like to get a cup of coffee. As the internal monologues pair off and leave, they criticize the people whom they\'ve been serving for so long, saying that they\'re made for one another, if only one of them would have the guts to start talking to the other.\nThe comic was guest-written by Questionable Content webcomic artist Jeph Jacques, whose dramatic comedy series has lasted more than 10 years and 3000 strips. The comic follows the vertical panel style typical of Questionable Content. But the art here is more in the xkcd style, showing only stick figures.\nSPOILER ALERT: the following paragraph reveals some important plot details of the Questionable Content webcomic.\nThis comic may be a reference to Marten and Faye, two characters from Questionable Content. Marten meets Faye in QC #3 but is too shy to talk to her. Faye is less shy and introduces herself to Marten. Later, Marten and Faye are living together and have a crush for each other, but they don\'t get together because Faye is afraid of relationships since her father killed himself.\nGuest Week was a series of five comics written by five other comic authors.
