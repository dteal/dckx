n\nDespite Randall being enthusiastic about receiving ink pens, his first experiment with them has resulted in a rather bleak comic.\nInstead of multiple panels, the entire comic is a single drawing, but as we travel down the page, there is an apparent passage of time or, unless a better phrase can be found, the degree of falling apart.\nThe comic seems to be expressing what it feels like when a relationship falls apart, and one of the implications is that the process cannot easily be reversed. At the top of the page, we see some people standing alone, apparently happy enough, and a couple. As we descend the page, we see examples of a couple split by a narrow chasm, someone isolated and alone on their own world fragment, a couple desperately trying to hang on to each other, and a single figure falling chaotically and without control.  \nThese figures are on a comic, and the representation is of what happens when their world \xe2\x80\x94 the page \xe2\x80\x94 literally falls apart. The implication is that this matches the actual feelings of people going through relationship breakups. In short, it is catastrophic.\nThe identity of \'#pugglewumper Tashari\', the supplier of the pens, is not known. Judging by the use of the hash sign, it is someone with whom Randall communicates in IRC. In fact, \'pugglewump\' appears to be an IRC channel. Although hashtags later came to be strongly associated with Twitter, this was not true at the time the comic was drawn.\n\n
