n\nCueball finds a lamp. It has a shape which suggests it is a magic lamp, which might contain a genie. Traditionally, genies grant three wishes to whoever frees them from their lamp by rubbing it. Cueball rubs the lamp, but instead of releasing a genie, the lamp spews some sort of fluid. Cueball is grossed out by this and holds the lamp away from him.\nThe imagery and style of the comic are intentionally similar to male stimulation and ejaculation. The act of rubbing genitals to stimulate orgasm is well known and well documented both in literature and in science. But almost anyone would be disturbed by unintentionally giving sexual pleasure to a stranger.\nIn the title text, a discussion is shown between Cueball and the lamp. Cueball states that what happened was NOT one of the three wishes he would have asked for if a genie had been released, and the lamp retorts, "Who said anything about YOUR wishes?", implying that the lamp\'s wish has been granted.\nGenies are mentioned in at least three other comics:\n\n152: Hamster Ball\n532: Piano (where the joke is also penis related)\n1391: Darkness\n\n
