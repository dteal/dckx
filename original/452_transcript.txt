n\nCueball and Beret Guy are on a mission, intending to destroy whatever machine they are in. Except that Beret Guy tends to be a bit surreal and brought a bag for holding pastries instead of explosive charges.\nThis is not the first time he\'s made such a bakery mistake; see 434: xkcd Goes to the Airport.\nHe then attempts to eat what Cueball identifies as Lug nuts, believing them to be scones. \nThe title text further emphasizes Beret Guy\'s obsession with bakery goods, by stating that if you pick up six random objects it is highly likely that one of these will be a scone, which explains his behaviour with the Lug nuts. This is of course a ridiculous assertion, as if it were true more than 16% of all things in the universe would have to be scones, a hypothesis easily disprovable by looking around any room which isn\'t a bakery.\nBeret guy and scones are also referenced in the title text of both 677: Asshole and 1030: Keyed.\n\n
