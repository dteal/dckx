n\nSince the first time the internet made possible to have sustained conversations with people in remote locations, it was found that most people tend to use harsh language in these conversations much more often than they would with regular spoken face-to-face conversations. This effect is similar to what happens when people drive a car: they\'re much more likely to get exasperated or angry at other drivers than they would when not driving.\nAlso, some people collectivelly known as Trolls find it funny to disrupt other people\'s conversations in internet forums, posing as innocent speakers. Examples of this can be entering a conversation between cancer patients suggesting the use of some "miracle" cure, or just asking simple, obvious questions and then pretending to not understand the answers. Most probably, trolls wouldn\'t have this behavior if they were speaking to a group of people in real life. A similar concept is Wikiterrorism, where someone intentionally includes false information in Wikipedia to see how long it lasts before someone notices.\nIn the first two panels, Cueball is  having some harsh words and probably insults with an other troll. Megan takes hold of Cueball and flies him to the other one, so they see each other face to face. In this situation, they both remain silent as none of them find anything to say to the other.\nWhen Megan returns Cueball to his original computer, both keep their conversation, but without the insults.\nThe title text just summarizes the whole idea into a single sentence.\n\n
