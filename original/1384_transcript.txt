n\nThis comic is an inverse version of the origin story of the superhero character Superman.\nIn the Superman story, Jor-El and his wife Lara notice that their home planet Krypton is about to be destroyed in a giant explosion, so they decide to send their baby Kal-El to Earth to save him - and there he becomes Superman.\nIn this comic, Cueball and Megan also notice that the planet Krypton is about to explode, but instead of attempting to save a baby from Krypton, they decide to send a baby to Krypton from Earth so that it\'ll stop annoying them with his crying.\nIn the fourth panel both spaceships can be seen. The rocket containing the Earth baby arrives at planet Krypton, while the crystal star shaped spaceship containing Kal-El leaves Krypton towards Earth - this is a reference to the version of the spaceship depicted in the 1978 Superman movie, (see trivia section).\nIn the fifth and last panel we see Krypton explode.\nIn the Superman movie, Kal-El carries with him a lot of information pre-recorded by his parents. During the very long trip he listens to the recordings, one of which explains that the Sun and gravity of Earth will give him (Kal-El) great powers (this is the way he becomes Superman). The title text is a satirical version of this information, given to the Earth baby during his trip: That Megan &amp; Cueball do not have the faintest idea (or care about) what the sun and gravity of Krypton will do to him - but their best guess at what these mostly will do to him is to "make you out of earshot from Earth", which was their original reason for shipping the baby off in the first place.\n\n
