n\nThe main point of this comic is that many tech-savvy people really don\'t know much about computers. They just have developed an intuition which works in many situations. This intuition is shown here in the form of a diagram. In particular, the chart exposes the computer expert\'s secret ingredient: trial and error.\nA flowchart is an organizational tool for showing process flow. A box is an instruction, a diamond indicates a question, and the arrows control the flow from one symbol to another. Other flowchart comics can be found here.\nThe title text is a sad admission that even knowing the procedure for how to fix the problem, many people will not follow it and still call tech support.\n\n
