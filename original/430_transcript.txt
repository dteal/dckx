n\nRandall successfully captures the way that dreams slip away and dissolve. Often it\'s hard to try to tell them to someone, and they make no sense, though they seemed so perfectly clear the moment you woke up.\nThe title text is a reference to C.S. Lewis\' novel The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, in which Lucy Pevensie reads a story in a book but afterwards can only remember that it had something to do with "a cup, a sword, a tree, and a green hill." (Presumably this was a retelling either of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe or else of the Crucifixion narrative.) Just as Lucy could only remember vague details about the story afterward, so Cueball cannot remember more than vague details about his dream when trying to tell it to Megan.\nAn effort to remember dreams was made in 269: TCMP.\n\n
