n\nThis is a sequel to 1288: Substitutions, but there have been several comics using substitutions both before and after that comic.\nIn this table, Randall suggests substituting several common phrases in generic news with similar or related phrases that mean something different for comical effect. Some of the replacements are synonyms, some are antonyms, and some are plain different concepts; and, even though they would (most of the time) make a grammatically correct sentence, the resulting idea would, however, often sound absurd or bizarre.\nSome of the examples might, also, mock the fact that many news contradict the actual facts or obvious results of a situation. For example, "[influential person] vows to do good to the world" would be replaced with a more usual fact "[influential person] probably won\'t do good to the world" - see example below with North Korean leader.\nThe title text is an example of how the closing sentence of a given article or report might sound after using the substitutions in the comic.\n\nBefore substitutions: Within a few years, our roads will be full of self-driving cars and our skies full of Amazon delivery drones.\nAfter substitutions: Within a few minutes, our roads will be full of uncontrollably-swerving cars and our skies full of Amazon delivery dogs.\n\nThe flying dogs could be a reference to 1614: Kites. Was the first of two in a row where Amazon is mentioned in the title text (next 1626: Judgment Day).\n\n
