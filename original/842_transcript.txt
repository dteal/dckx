n\nIn this comic Cueball believes he is part of a secret society, so secret that he doesn\'t know anything about the society. His belief in the existence of the society, and that he is a part of it, stem from one contact with an \'agent\'. Most people would immediately dismiss the idea of such a secret society, especially with no evidence of its existence, and no knowledge of the goals or even whether it is inherently good or evil. \nSix years after being \'chosen\', Cueball finds the scrap of paper with an address on, and the can of kerosene. Both of these events are not unlikely, and easily explained as simple coincidences, but Cueball somehow sees this as a command that he must burn down the house. Cueball shows that he is willing to put other peoples lives at risk, destroy property and possessions, and face the possibility of prison all because of one event six years prior.\nCueball\'s belief in the society, his delusional linking of the address and kerosene, and his actions in burning down the house, show how badly he wants to be part of something bigger, and to find meaning in the "Chaos of Life". \nThe punchline refers to an old grade school/middle school prank (Urban Dictionary: pen 15 club, Pen 15.) You\'d typically walk up to an unsuspecting schoolmate and ask him if he wants to join the Pen Fifteen club. You\'d tell him that to join, you merely have to write the club name on him. You\'d then write "PEN15" on his hand or arm, and everyone would laugh at him because it looks like "PENIS". (In a common variant, it is simply called the Pen Club, 15 is the victim\'s "member number", and the pranksters write "PEN13" and "PEN14" on themselves.) In this case, Cueball fell victim to this prank as a child without ever figuring out the joke.\nAs for the title text, solipsism is the philosophical idea that only your own mind is sure to exist while other minds can\'t be really known and so those other minds are not proved to be real.\n\n
