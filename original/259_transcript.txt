n\nAnother entry into the My Hobby series.\n"O RLY?" is an Internet meme typically used to express sarcastic agreement with or feigned surprise at a statement. The typical response to "O RLY" is usually "YA RLY", "NO WAI" or "SRSLY?" These exchanges are SMS abbreviations for "Oh really?", "Yeah really", "No way!", and "Seriously?" respectively.\nHowever, Cueball\'s response avoids this typical exchange, instead replying with another clich\xc3\xa9, derived from a classic double entendre.\nIn this clich\xc3\xa9, the speaker responds to a statement containing a word ending with \'-er\', and turns it into a sexual reference. The setup is as follows:\n\n Alan: "Do you want to come over to my house? My wife and I are playing poker."\n Bob: "Poker? I hardly KNOW her!"\n\nSuch a double entendre makes no sense in the context of an O RLY exchange. In the case of the comic, the non-sequitur will likely baffle the person on the left and derail the conversation, to the amusement of the person on the right. The reason Randall makes this a hobby is, presumably, that it bores him when people fall back on clich\xc3\xa9s for comedy, and he seeks inventive ways to humor himself in these situations.  See, for example, https://xkcd.com/16/.\nThe title text takes the real clich\xc3\xa9 "fight fire with fire," and combines it with the more literal "fight clich\xc3\xa9s with clich\xc3\xa9s." The resulting statement follows a very similar principle to the situation in the comic proper. Also, for some reason or another, the &amp;eacute; does not evaluate to \xc3\xa9.\n\n
