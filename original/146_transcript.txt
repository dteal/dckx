n\nThis comic refers to the 1980s TV-comicseries (and Greeting Card subjects) "Care Bears" in which various cuddly bears in rainbow colors go on missions to save the world. The characters\' ultimate weapon is the "Care Bear Stare," in which the Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective tummy symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target\'s heart.\n"Myspace" is the social networking site myspace.com. Cueball is convincing Black Hat to create an account at this networking site, but Black Hat isn\'t interested. Then, when Black Hat gets annoyed by Cueball\'s persuasions, he activates his "carebearstare", thus overthrowing Cueball\'s request to be friends only.\nOne possible explanation for Black Hat\'s odd choice of weaponry is that he is mocking Cueball. The phrase "Please? I\'ll friend you" sounds like an average preschooler\'s coaxing (along the lines of "Please? I\'ll be your friend!"). Therefore, Black Hat may feel that Cueball\'s remarks seem childish and deserve a childish backlash.\nOn a nostalgic note, considering the state of social media in the 2010s, Black Hat is just really good at foreshadowing.\nIn the title text, Black Hat reflects that he uses his carebearstare power too much, possibly as a form of apology to Cueball.\n\n
