n\nThe save dialogue shows a download from 65.222.202.53, an IP address that hosted JavaScript malware during a recent attack on the Tor anonymity network, with a very long file title. Many of the extensions used inside there indicate executable code; multiple file extensions are sometimes used to disguise a trojan program as a document.\nYou also see common download syntax for a pirated movie, Hackers, likely included to appear malicious to anyone skimming but is actually a movie about hackers, making it a benign reference rather than malicious. It is described as "_BLURAY_CAM", which contradicts itself ("_BLURAY" would mean it was ripped from a copy on Blu-ray Disc, while "_CAM" would mean it was copied by pointing a camera at the screen in the cinema). "_BLURAY_CAM" would probably indicate a search-keyword-stuffed fake copy; fake pirated media often contain viruses (although this is more likely to be a problem with newer media, before the first real pirated copy appears).\nThe URL contains the path "~tilde/pub/cia-bin/etc". The first part is a public folder of a user named tilde (which is also the name for the ~ symbol), "cgi-bin" is a common folder on a Web-Server for server side executables (Randall changes the name to CIA-bin), and "etc" is a standard folder for configuration files \xe2\x80\x93 normally never accessible through a webserver. The program "init.dll" isn\'t executable at all, it\'s a Windows Dynamic Link Library which can\'t be run standalone, and is rarely referenced in URLs (even though such syntax is still being employed, even on reputable websites (Google search) or here at eBay, indicating the webserver is a Microsoft ASP server). The question mark indicates the start of a parameter list, and in this case we have only one named "FILE".\nThe "Save" button is disabled; you can only click the "Cancel" button. This can be different when the server detects that you are using a secure (https) connection.\nThe complete content sent to the server, starting with "/~TILDE..." and ending with "...OUT.EXE", is exactly 256 characters long. On HTML 3 specifications you have a limitation of 1024 characters, whereas later HTML specifications don\'t have this limit; it just depends on the web server\'s capabilities. But posting parameters directly at the URL is still a worse choice.\nThe content of the parameter is shown here:\n\n__ (underscore underscore) \xe2\x80\x94 used in the C programming language to denote that a symbol is really not for public consumption.\nAUTOEXEC.BAT \xe2\x80\x94 a file which is automatically run during startup on Windows/DOS operating systems, and was often modified by viruses, which added malicious code to be run on each boot.\nMY%20OSX%20DOCUMENTS \xe2\x80\x94 referencing the OSX operating system (%20 is a representation of a space in a URL, i.e. it reads as "MY OSX DOCUMENTS").\nINSTALL.EXE \xe2\x80\x94 a typical installer.\nRAR \xe2\x80\x94 a compressed archive file type.\nINI \xe2\x80\x94 a configuration file type.\nTAR \xe2\x80\x94 a file archive popular in UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems. TAR has been mentioned before.\nDO\xc3\x87X \xe2\x80\x94 docx is an Office Open XML file, i.e. a word processing format used by Microsoft Word 2007 and above, but has no cedilla (\xc2\xb8). The addition of a cedilla may be a reference to exploits that rely on rare characters being mistaken for more common ones that look similar, such as the IDN homograph attack.\nPHPHPHP \xe2\x80\x94 a play on PHP files, a kind of server-based web page file type. PHP originally stood for "Personal Home Page" but was later redefined as the recursive abbreviation "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".\nXHTML \xe2\x80\x94 another web page file type.\nTML \xe2\x80\x94 stands for Transducer Markup Language, an XML based markup language that specifies how to capture, time-tag and describe sensor data.\nXTL \xe2\x80\x94 possibly a play on XHTML.\nTXXT \xe2\x80\x94 a play on TXT file types.\n0DAY.HACK \xe2\x80\x94 a reference to a zero-day exploit. (overlaps with the next entry)\nHACK.ERS_(1995)_BLURAY_CAM-XVID \xe2\x80\x94 a reference to the 1995 Hackers movie, but pirated movies would either be a BlurayRIP/DVDRIP or CAM, but not both at the same time unless you used a camera to record the Blu-ray movie as it played.\nEXE \xe2\x80\x94 an executable file type used by Microsoft Windows.\n[SCR] \xe2\x80\x94 a tag used by movie pirates to denote a \'Screener\', the DVD copy of films given to critics prior to theater release. Usually the highest quality available at the time, rare, and thus good bait for a virus-laden download. ".scr" is also the extension for screensaver files, really just an exe file with a different extension and one of the classical ways to distribute infected files.\nLISP \xe2\x80\x94 programming language.\nMSI \xe2\x80\x94 an installation file used by Microsoft Installer.\nLNK \xe2\x80\x94 an extension used by Microsoft Windows for shortcuts. The extension is normally hidden to the user.\nLNK, ZDA, GNN \xe2\x80\x94 references to Link, Zelda, and Ganon, important characters from The Legend of Zelda video game franchise.\nWRBT.OBJ \xe2\x80\x94 A reference to the line of code Dennis Nedry used in Jurassic Park to shut down key systems.\nO \xe2\x80\x94 The extension for a linker file, an intermediary created when compiling C code.\nH \xe2\x80\x94 The file extension of a header file in C code.\nSWF \xe2\x80\x94 Shockwave Flash file type.\nDPKG \xe2\x80\x94 The Debian package management, although the package files use the file suffix .deb.\nAPP \xe2\x80\x94 an application on Mac OS X operating system.\nZIP \xe2\x80\x94 compressed archive file type.\nCO \xe2\x80\x94 the top-level domain (TLD) for Colombia, but marketed as a global domain. Some countries use .co.TLD for general use, e.g. .co.uk in the United Kingdom. But the TLD .gz does not exist and thus .co.gz is invalid.\nGZ \xe2\x80\x94 a compressed file using GNU zip.\nA.OUT \xe2\x80\x94 Default filename when creating an executable on Linux or other UNIX-like operating systems if none was specified for the compiler.\n\nThe title text suggests changing from http to https, as if encrypting a suspicious file before downloading it is somehow better than downloading it unencrypted. http (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and https (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol - Secure) are the two common protocols for getting web pages and web downloads. http is the simple download, whereas https adds an SSL encryption layer so the item being downloaded cannot be viewed unencrypted by anyone except the end recipient. Changing http to https is a common suggestion to improve security when browsing the web from an insecure network (such as a public WiFi hotspot) to avoid surveillance or hijacking to a malicious website; Google automatically switches to https for all mail accounts and is starting to do so with searches. The end recipient will still get whatever nasties were in the original, however \xe2\x80\x94 encrypting it doesn\'t change the content at all.\nThe IP address referenced in the comic, 65.222.202.53, is currently being used by the shellcode of a JavaScript 0-day exploit for the Tor Browser Bundle being run by the FBI to phone home over the clearnet [1] and de-anonymize visitors to websites on Freedom Hosting that are serving child pornography. [2]\nThe title of this comic, "The Mother of All Suspicious Files", is a reference to The Mother of All Demos from Douglas Engelbart.\n\n
