n\nCueball is startled every few months when he, again, realizes that he now lives in the 21st century. When he grew up as a child the year 2000 seemed very far away \xe2\x80\x94 it was the future, but he now exists in that timeframe with the rest of society.\nThe title text states that "the future" was reached in 2004... Three years before the comic was published. This is possibly a joke on how time works, as "the future" is always, was always, and will always be ahead of the time you\'re at. There may, however, be a reference to some movie set in the future year 2004...\nThe 20th century, even the year 2004 was futuristic for people growing up in, for instance, the eighties. This view just belongs to the perspective of people \xe2\x80\x94 for people growing up in the 70s the novel 1984 was even futuristic.\n\n
