n\nRandall presents a Venn diagram, or a logical diagram that illustrates the relationship between multiple sets. The diagram is usually used when sets overlap. In other words, a Venn diagram of "even numbers" and "numbers divisible by 5" would have 2, 4, 6, 8, 12\xe2\x80\xa6. In one circle, 5, 15, 25\xe2\x80\xa6 in another circle, and 10, 20, 30\xe2\x80\xa6 in the intersection of the circles (as those numbers fit into both sets).\nHere we have a three-set diagram which Randall has purportedly created to explain his feelings to his love interest.\nThe three sets are: 1) People who can always make him smile; 2) people he wants to spend the rest of his life with and 3) people who constantly show him new things to love about the world. In the intersection of these three sets is "you" \xe2\x80\x93 his love interest, all three of those statements apply to her.\nNormally this might be a cute way of simply implying that he has these three feelings about her, without including any other elements in any of the sets. However, here, Randall has included one other element: Vanilla Ice (an early 1990s rapper) is shown to also constantly show Randall new things to love about the world, and is also someone Randall wants to spend the rest of his life with (although Vanilla Ice doesn\'t always make him smile).\nVanilla Ice is a Caucasian (read "white") rapper who was most popular in the early 1990s with his song "Ice Ice Baby". He was frequently mocked as a very "white" rapper. He is obviously an unexpected name to turn up in this diagram.\nApparently Randall\'s love interest didn\'t take too well to Randall professing similar feelings for Vanilla Ice as he did for her, causing some friction in their relationship. The title text suggests that other 90s rappers have similarly affected Randall\'s past relationships.\n\n
