n\nA palindrome is a word, phrase, or sentence that reads the same whether you read forwards or backwards, like race car.  Normally capitalization, spacing, and punctuation are ignored.\nThis comic is based on the famous palindrome: "A Man, A Plan, A Canal: Panama", devised by Leigh Mercer, which references the construction of the Panama Canal and is the first mentioned on the Wikipedia page for palindromes at the time this comic was released. \nMegan recites a much longer palindrome for Cueball. This palindrome is based on the original, and was posted in this forum thread more than three years before the release of this comic. It is much less logical, and manages to include the word anal (which then refers to the title text and sex toys, see below).\n\'Nam is an apheresis of Vietnam. See more explanation of the words in the palindrome in the Trivia section. Note that in the original version from the link above there was a comma before tables so it is two items in the list: God\'s \'Nam, tables, etc.\nDue to its list like structure, the Panama palindrome is easily extensible by adding additional noun phrases, and some of these extensions lay claim to being "The Longest Palindrome Ever".\nThe title text references the maximum size of ships that can fit through the Panama Canal, which is Panamax. Randall would really enjoy if this was the last option (i.e. biggest size) on a drop-down menu on a sex toy site. For instance such a site could have a banner saying; "If you have a Panama Anal, then try our Panamax Butt plug".\nIn the game 1608: Hoverboard there is also a reference to the palindrome and the Panama canal with the song that Cueball sings at the ruin to the right. The first four lines of the song is the same as in the original palindrome but with the "A " changed out with Spider-, and then also Spider in front of Panama:\n\nCueball singing:\nSpider-man \nSpider-plan\n\nSpider-canal\nSpider-Panama\n\nGates let in\nSpider boats\n\nFlood the locks\nSpiders float\n\nLook out!\nSpiders in both oceans.\n\n\n
