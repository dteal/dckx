n\nThe binary numeral system refers to a counting system in base-2, which uses only the digits 0 and 1, as opposed to the more familiar base-10 decimal system, which uses the digits 0 through 9. In this case, the scale of 1 to 10 is using binary, so in decimal it would be a scale of 1 to 2. Since 4 in binary is "100" it doesn\'t fit into the range "1" to "10" in a binary system. And Megan doesn\'t even know the number "4" because she\'s only working on the binary system, this character does not exist for her.\nIt is also possible that Megan is using base-3, which also doesn\'t use a \'4\' but counts 1, 2, 10, etc.  Base-4 also doesn\'t have a number \'4\' in it, despite having a \'4\' in its name; it counts 1, 2, 3, 10, etc.\nIt should be noted that if Megan is indeed speaking out loud in such a way that confuses Cueball, she would be saying "ten" out loud; this would automatically indicate she is indeed using base-10 (or higher). The correct pronunciation of "10" in base-2 is "one zero".\nThe title text uses a similar joke. Since test scores are usually written as either a letter grade or a percentage, 11 correct questions out of 100 would be a failing score in decimal notation. However, 11/100 in binary translates to 3/4 in decimal, which would be 75%, accepted in most classes as a \'C\' grade.\n\n
