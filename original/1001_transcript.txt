n\nMegan and Cueball get the idea to build a rotating bed from a TV show like Cribs, which documents the decadent homes of the wealthy.\nRotating beds are typically used for sexual activity and variety, but Cueball and Megan have made theirs rotate far too fast, like a roundabout, to be useful for this purpose.\nThe last panel is a flashback to earlier that day, when they see a rotating bed on television. Megan comments that a rotating bed does not seem difficult to build.\nThe title text implies that the high speed of rotation is not accidental as we may have assumed from the comic, but intentional, due to Megan and Cueball\'s erroneous belief that the rotation itself is supposed to turn them on, not the sexual activity they would engage in on the moving bed. A turning bed is also a pun with "turned-on."\n\n
