n\nThis comic is a chart of the frequency of certain phrases in Google search results, based on the format "died in a ______ accident." If you enclose search terms in quotation marks, Google will look up the exact phrase rather than the individual words in any order.\n"Gardening accident" is a reference to the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, in which one of the band\'s many ill-fated drummers died in this fashion.\n"Died in a blogging accident" was very rare in Google until this comic appeared. It could be found on over 10,000 webpages approximately 12 hours after the comic was posted. Similarly, both snake charming and haberdashery accidents also return hundreds of Google results.\n\n
