n\nEmily Dickinson is a famous American poet, who wrote a poem called "Death", about the personification of Death kindly stopping for her to pick her up. \nGrand Theft Auto (GTA) is a famous video game series, where the player frequently steals cars by grabbing their drivers and throwing them out of the car. In Xbox versions of GTA the Y-button is used to enter (steal) or exit a vehicle. \nThe Emily Dickinson edition of Grand Theft Auto mashes up these two concepts. When Death stops to pick up the protagonist (Hairbun, possibly representing Dickinson herself), she violently carriage-jacks him and takes over his carriage to use for her own purposes.\nThe title text refers to Randall learning from the web comic Achewood that a poem written in ballad meter can be sung to the tune of Gilligan\'s Island, a 1960s sitcom with a catchy intro song. Since then he has not been able to read the poem normally, he always begins to hum the tune... He does seem rather displeased with this.\n\n
