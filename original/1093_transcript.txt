n\nThe median age in USA is currently about 37 years. Assuming that you must be at least five years old to remember a cultural event later, this means that anything that happened more than thirty-two years ago is remembered by a minority of people today. This applies to any event prior to 1980, so here in 2012, the majority of Americans are too young to remember the Seventies. However, according to census estimation the median will raise in the future, so instead of a 32 years gap between event and the moment when most people can\'t remember it, the gap becomes 35 years (implying a median of some 40 years).\n2013: The Carter presidency Jimmy Carter was the President of the United States from 1977-1981.

According to Wikipedia, his decisions to reinstate registration for the draft and his decision to boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow (over the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan) helped contribute to his defeat in the 1980 Presidential campaign.\n2014: The Reagan shooting References the 1981 assassination attempt on the then American president, Ronald Reagan.\n2015: The Falkland Islands War This is in reference to the brief outbreak of hostilities between the UK and Argentina over the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) located off the shore of Argentina claimed by both but controlled by the UK.

The public backlash so shook the company that they reintroduced the original recipe as Coca-Cola Classic within 3 months.

The following rush of people to the Wall from East (to cross the border) and from West (to welcome friends and relatives) in that night coined the figurative "Fall of the Wall", preceding the actual reunion of Germany in 1990 and (almost) complete demolition of the Wall.\n2024: HammerTime Refers to a refrain in MC Hammer\'s 1990 hit song U Can\'t Touch This; Randall Munroe makes reference to this song elsewhere in his comics, too (specifically 108: M.C.
