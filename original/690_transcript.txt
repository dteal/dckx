n\nThe World Trade Center towers were destroyed on September 11, 2001 (9/11 in American date notation). The planned attack was for two planes to collide with the north and south towers simultaneously, but what ended up happening was that plane 1 hit the north tower at 8:46 am, and the second plane hit the south tower a little less than 20 minutes later. In the ensuing investigation many people raised questions that didn\'t seem to get a satisfactory answer for several months, if not years. Many people, who called themselves 9/11 Truthers, began to claim that the whole thing was a government conspiracy, in what has come to be known as the "controlled demolition plot" (referenced by the title of this comic), which alleges that the towers were brought down not by the fires caused by the planes but by demolition charges intentionally placed there by the government.\nRandall proposes a compromise to make both those who believe in the conspiracy and those who don\'t happy. Since there is only a government related video of a plane flying into the north tower \xe2\x80\x94 done by a man who was with FDNY fire fighters \xe2\x80\x94 that was a government conspiracy. But it just so happened that the government decided to demolish the north tower on the same day that terrorists decided to demolish the south tower.\nThe title text is a restatement of the Golden Mean fallacy: that the truth can be found in a compromise between two opposite positions. In this comic, one of the positions is a fanciful conspiracy theory and the other is a sober fact-based conclusion.  The error of this fallacy is apparent here, as it can lead  to even more ridiculous conclusions. In this case, the compromise theory would make no one happy because both sides would have to concede claims which they have already dismissed as bogus, as well as accept an incredibly unlikely coincidence.\nOn January 6, 2016, the Onion, a satirical news site, reported that the government has confirmed Randall\'s theory by releasing an article titled, Government Admits It Was Only Behind Destruction Of North Tower.\nThis is the first in the Category:Compromise but since then Randall has proposed several compromises, where most will also be unlikely to be accepted...\n\n
