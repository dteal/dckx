n\n\nMegan is upset because she is apparently older than 26, and among people who marry, half do so below 26. The intuitive conclusion is that the number of potential partners is decreasing as time goes on.\nThe Half Plus Seven Rule is an unwritten rule which asserts that it is creepy to date anyone who is younger than half your age plus 7 years. For example, a 50 year old dating someone who is 31 or younger would be classed as creepy. As the graph on the right shows, there is a lower limit and an upper limit.\n\nThe lower limit defines the minimum age of your partner in order that you are not considered creepy.\nThe upper limit defines the maximum age of your partner in order that they are not considered creepy.\n\nAs age increases, they age range of potential non-creepy partners widens. At 26 the range of non creepy partners is 18 years (20 to 38 year olds). At 50 it is a range of 54 years (32 to 86 years old).\nAt age 14, you can only date people your own age. The same also works with infinity, but even Methuselah died once.\nWhile the application of this rule actually reduces the number of potential matches further, Cueball presents it in a positive way. By showing that there are whole swathes of people who she couldn\'t marry in the first place without being in a creepy relationship, and that as her age increases the range of non-creepy partners increases, combined with Census Bureau data, Cueball shows that her eligible dating pool is in fact still increasing.\nMegan notes that graph-making nerds like Cueball may have a hard time finding dates, but this is belied by the title text.\n\n\n
