n\nU+202e is a unicode control character that changes all subsequent text to right-to-left (RTL, as the title references). In the comic, Black Hat tires of Cueball\'s complaining and inserts a U+202e character in the middle of Cueball\'s speech, turning his complaints into gibberish - sentences that must be read from right-to-left. \nThe title of the comic builds on this theme, with the title of the webpage it is hosted on being LTR in some browsers (see trivia), the reverse of the comic name.\nWhat Cueball actually tries to say after Black Hats change is:\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 They didn\'t even...\n...What the hell?\nHow did you...\n...Asshole.\n\nWhen multiple writers work on the same text, arguments can often arise with some writers resorting to vandalizing the works of other writers. The title text takes this up a level, suggesting the use of U+202e and other direction control characters in editor wars to disrupt other people\'s work. For reference for future wars U+202c returns text back to its normal direction.\n\n
