n\nThis comic adds strange twists to some classic abysmally cheesy pickup lines. Warning, terrible puns ahead:\n\n"If I could rearrange the alphabet, I\'d put U and I together."\n\nCueball is making a "your sister" joke.\n\n"Is your father a thief? Because he stole all of the stars in the sky and put them in your eyes."(Is Your Dad Pick Up Lines)\n\nA Jetta is a car, and Cueball is implying the father is an actual thief.\n\n"You must be tired, \'cause you\'ve been running through my mind all night."\n\nHe adds the word "Screaming", to make the word "running" be literal instead of figurative.\n\nThe title text refers to a pickup line like this: "That shirt looks good on you, but would look even better on my bedroom floor." But here the shirt is used as fuse for a Molotov cocktail thrown into their office.\n\n
