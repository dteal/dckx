n\nThe comic itself is pretty self-explanatory; Cueball had a very emotional dream.\nThis comic is a commentary on people who dream, daydream, and wish for things to happen, commonly in a romantic context. Cueball dreams of a girl who gives him a time and a place, and the last panel implies that he went to that place at the given time, but did not find the girl. The strip builds up hope and anticipation that this supernaturally romantic reunion will occur, but grounds the reader with the last line of the comic and the title text.\nThe coordinates of the note lead to Reverend Thomas J. Williams Park in Cambridge, MA, USA. The time on the note, September 23, 2007, was about six months after the publishing of this comic. One hundred eighty-one days, to be exact.\nNotably, several hundred xkcd fans met up at that very time and place. Randall also visited the meetup, and was recorded as saying "Maybe wanting something does make it real."\nThe idea that the frame of the comic grabs the people inside was already used in comic 82: Frame.\n\n
