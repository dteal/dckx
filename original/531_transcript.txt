n\nMegan comments that Cueball is force-feeding their child so many sugary drinks that the child runs the risk of developing diabetes. Cueball responds that that is the plan, since if anything were to go wrong, they\'ll just have to stop giving her insulin, which will kill her. Cueball then comments that he thus takes the Jurassic Park approach to parenting.\nJurassic Park is a series of books and films centering on a disastrous attempt to create a theme park of cloned dinosaurs. In particular, the park scientists give the dinosaurs lysine deficiency as a contingency plan, so that if some dinosaur were to escape, it wouldn\'t be able to survive in the wild. In practice, lysine can easily be obtained by eating protein-rich foods like red meat, lamb or pork.\nThe title text continues the theme, noting that having children is basically one big genetic experiment, and that Cueball is experimenting responsibly, by having a contingency plan, thinking ahead as to the possible consequences of his experiment.\n\n
