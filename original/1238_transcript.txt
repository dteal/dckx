n\nThis comic is a reference to a scene one might imagine in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in which Yoda expresses doubt in a young Anakin\'s potential to join the Jedi order. Yoda delivers a speech similar to the one that Ponytail gives here, except that the end of the sequence he presents is "the dark side" instead of "being an asshole". Yoda is ultimately correct; Anakin\'s fears lead him to join the dark side so that he may keep his loved ones from dying; this is at the expense of the stability of the galaxy, however, and his actions are in vain, as his wife dies nonetheless. The circle on the ground is also taken from the Star Wars scene, and Cueball is presumably in the Mace Windu role.\nHere, Randall compares Anakin\'s decision to join the dark side to the propensity of many Internet commenters to correct others on their spelling and grammar, and to the extreme prevalence of criticism over commendation or confirmation. Randall\'s point is that correcting people, like joining the dark side, ultimately stems from insecurity.\nPonytail and Cueball challenge Megan to type the sentence "I heard you\'re idea\'s and their definately good", which contains four common misspellings (you&#39;re instead of your, idea&#39;s instead of ideas [see greengrocers\' apostrophe], their instead of they\'re, and definately instead of definitely) and a grammatical error (a missing comma before the word "and").\nRegarding the content, this sentence is one that is highly unlikely to be ever read in an internet argument, as almost every time people still have things they claim to know better about.\nMegan thus can\'t bring herself to typing this sentence, having spent so much time judging others for their trivial errors, even when they\'re saying helpful things like the sentence in question. Instead, it is strongly implied that she smashes the computer and runs away \xe2\x80\x94 demonstrating the sort of anger that "Grammar Nazis" and internet wiseacres like her can feel about punctuation and spelling errors, and about content-related errors respectively. Cueball and Ponytail remark on this, both failing to use apostrophes.\nThe title text refers to Terry Pratchett\'s novel Equal Rites, in which the characters discover that the most powerful magic is not using magic \xe2\x80\x94 with the distinction that not using magic because you don\'t know how is not the same as choosing to refrain from using magic when you do know how. Randall is comparing this with use or misuse of the rules of Standard English: not even knowing the rules is not admirable, whereas knowing the rules but choosing to disregard them is. There is also a double meaning - not writing anything at all is in fact "saying nothing".\n\n
