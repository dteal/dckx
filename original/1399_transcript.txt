n\nThis comic pokes fun at the 1993 film Jurassic Park, which features a theme park filled with cloned dinosaurs. In the film, chaos ensues when all the dinosaurs escape and begin terrorizing their creators. The list of chaos topics, phase space, nonlinear equations, and strange attractors, comes directly from the movie, in which Dr. Ian Malcolm (portrayed by Jeff Goldblum), a mathematician and chaos theorist brought in to inspect the park prior to its grand opening, suggests that the dinosaurs\' escaping could have been predicted based on mathematical chaos models.\nCueball explains that although he has also studied chaos theory, he has never seen where chaos models predict that dinosaurs would escape. Cueball\'s confusion highlights the contrast between the mathematical definition of chaos \xe2\x80\x93 shown in the graphs on the whiteboard \xe2\x80\x93 and its common meaning \xe2\x80\x93 a state of utter confusion or disorder (as illustrated in the film).\nThe whiteboard shows a bifurcation diagram of the logistic map (one of the simplest examples of the mathematical concept of chaos, also featured in what-if 105) and a dragon curve, which appeared on the section title pages of the novel Jurassic Park, upon which the film was based.\nThe title text references the scene in Jurassic Park in which Goldblum, as Malcolm, while making small talk with Drs. Alan Grant (portrayed by Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (portrayed by Laura Dern) during the helicopter ride to the park, responds to a remark with an  odd-sounding laugh. The laugh has gained minor Internet notoriety after being used as the central sample in at least one remix.\nThe comic may be timely, as a remastered 3-D version of the film was released in April 2013, and a fourth film in the Jurassic Park franchise is scheduled for release in June 2015.\n\n
