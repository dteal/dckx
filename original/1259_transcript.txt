n\nMegan is explaining the evolutionary phenomenon of mimicry of female insects which fools male insects into trying to mate with the flower (pseudocopulation). This causes the pollen of the flower to stick to the male bee, who may make the same mistake with another flower, allowing for pollination.\nThis particular orchid mimicked the solitary bee Eucera, which now only pollinates it in the Mediterranean (the bee isn\'t really extinct yet). This may eventually lead to the extinction of the orchid due to lack of reproduction. In most areas where it grows, the orchid is using a method of self-pollination, which can be detrimental to the genetic vitality of the species as it is a form of in-breeding.\nPhotographs of Ophrys apifera:\nx250px x250px\nFemale Eucera (Synhaolonia) guarding nests (left) and male Eucera (right):\nx200px x200px\nIn a similar way, some plants depend to animal species now extinct, but as the dependency was not about pollination but about spreading seeds across the land, those plant species can still last millions of years after the animal species extinction. For instance, it\xe2\x80\x99s the case of the avocado.\nThe comic plays on the subject of levels of indirectness of memory or knowledge representation. The female bee is extinct, remembered only by the male bee\'s perception of her; the male bee is also extinct, but its memory of the female is preserved in the orchid\'s shape; the orchid, due to self-pollination, is nearing extinction, but the memory of the female bee is now preserved by Beret Guy\'s memory of the orchid, remembering the male bee\'s memory of her.\nThe title text culminates this theme by invoking the idea that some day human beings will, likewise, be extinct, and aliens will be able to learn about us through the distorted and faded representations of ourselves that we leave behind - Axe commercials which, like the orchid, present an idealized form to deceptively attract mates. We are left to speculate whether these aliens will be able to construct, somehow, through three levels of indirectness (the human representation, the orchid\'s representation and the male bee\'s perception) any memory of the female Eucera, and, if so, how distorted a view of the bee it will be.\n\n
