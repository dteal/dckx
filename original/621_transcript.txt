n\nThe comic parodies a famous advertisement campaign for the Dos Equis beer brand. In the campaign, Jonathan Goldsmith plays "The Most Interesting Man in the World", a suave elderly gentleman with a number of astonishing life experiences and skills. The campaign\'s format generally includes the narrator presenting hyperbolic descriptions of the man\'s accomplishments, followed by the man delivering his signature catchphrase, "I don\'t always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis.", which has been widely adopted as an internet meme.\nCueball plays the antithesis of the protagonist in the campaign: the least interesting man in the world. Unlike the stories in the advertisement, his affairs tend to bore the listeners. Being the generic everyman, he possesses no outstanding capabilities at all. While the original is said to "speak French... in Russian", Cueball seems to have forgotten his French altogether. He also has apparently nothing of interest to tell, either in real life or in his blog. Instead, he will talk away about his weird dreams and his success in video games. Moreover, he is unable to stand too much beer and therefore absolutely ill-qualified to advertise it.\nThe title text is a reference to the slogan of the campaign "Stay thirsty, my friends." It also references Team Fortress 2 (TF2), a multi-platform, multi-player First-person shooter game.\n\n
