n\nThis comic is a parody on the opening scene of the science fiction monster movie Pacific Rim from 2013. In the film, huge monsters called Kaiju (for instance Godzilla is a big Kaiju) entered the world through an inter-dimensional portal under the Pacific ocean and attacked coastal cities. The first Kaiju attacks the city of San Francisco, killing tens of thousands of people before its death five days later. \nIn this comic, officials and police are evidently trying to describe the extraordinary qualities of a huge monster by comparing it with everyday objects instead of numbers, which is a recurring theme on xkcd (see 526: Converting to Metric, 1047: Approximations) and also in the Blag article Dictionary of Numbers where Randall says "I don\'t like large numbers without context."\nThis comic pokes fun at how common it is in the media to compare things of extraordinary qualities to a certain narrow set of well-known objects. The comic features people discussing a fictional monster which - apparently - can be only described by these overused comparisons. The three used by Megan, Cueball and Ponytail are:\n\nThe monster is as long as a football field. This is most likely an American football field (given the author is American). So the monster is about 120 yards/110 m long.\nHere is an example from Wikipedia where a building is compared to the length of a football field.\n\nThe monster runs as fast as a cheetah, at least 60 mph or 96 kmh.\nThe Cheetah is famous for being the fastest land animal at full sprint. Like the monster, the cheetah is prone to comparisons: to cars, since 60 mph is a common highway speed limit. Unlike a cheetah, however, the monster\'s speed is almost certainly thanks to its large stride.\n\nThe monster is as heavy as a blue whale (about 180 tonnes).\nHere is an example where the weight of a blue whale is used in two different comparison (something heavier and something lighter).\n\nFinally it is stated that it has the intelligence of a two-year-old child. Comparing someones intelligence to a child of a given age is very common.\nHere is an example where a dog is compared to a two year old kid.\nThere is even an xkcd comic that is referring to this age IQ: 1364: Like I\'m Five.\n\n\nThe caption below the panel names the monster the Frequently-Made Comparisons Monster and continues the joke by comparing the number of killed people to those that could fill a (sports) stadium (of the order tens of thousands), and the area of devastation to the smallest state in the US Rhode Island (1,214&#160;sq&#160;mi/3,140&#160;km2) (a state Randall also used for comparison in the What if? Everybody Jump. In another What if? he uses a football stadium filled with ants as a comparison: Lethal Neutrinos.)\nThe title text take the joke one step further by comparing the nuclear bomb used to destroy the monster to the bomb dropped on the Hiroshima at the end of the second world war. This is an oft-used reference for explosive devices, and implying that it is the frequently-made-comparison quality of the bomb that destroyed the monster. (Here is an example from Wikipedia of such a comparison with the strength of a meteor strike.)\n\n
