n\nPrior to the events in this comic, Cueball has evidently told Megan that he made an assumption about something. Megan starts to respond with a takeoff on the modern proverb: "When you assume, you make an ass out of you and me." This proverb plays on the fact that the word "assume" may be broken down into the letters "ass", "u", and "me", and is intended to suggest that one should not make assumptions because they may turn out to be wrong and make those involved appear foolish.\nHowever, when Megan evokes the proverb in the modified form "You know what happens when you assume", Cueball astutely points out that her phrasing itself is hypocritical in that it makes the assumption that he knows what happens when you assume. Megan stops to ponder Cueball\'s point, to which Cueball responds "Check and Mate": a common phrase originating from chess \xe2\x80\x94 suggesting triumph or having successfully countered another person\'s argument to which there can be no retort.\nIn part, Cueball\'s response demonstrates that, in life we make assumptions almost every time we speak. This only tends to be problematic in the few instances where the assumption is wrong.\nThe title text is a play on the original "assume" pun, breaking down the word "assert", into "ass" and "ert", with "ERT" being an acronym for "Emergency Response Team".\nThis comic follows a pattern similar to 1657: Insanity.\n\n
