n\nThe comic starts to set up a joke about the "phone wars" between the iPhone and phones that run the Android system (in this case the Motorola Droid), but instead just brings up a serious point criticizing the consumerism this "war" stems from. In the last line of panel 2, Cueball refers to the slogan "There\'s an app for that" from Apple\'s iPhone marketing.\nThen the third panel makes a joke anyway, at Apple\'s expense: apparently, this "enlightenment app" was rejected from Apple\'s app store, which is the only supported way to put software on an iPhone. Apple has become infamous for rejecting apps from their app store without adequately explaining why. Android devices, on the other hand, are not limited to an app store and can install software from any origin. Many, however, use the Google Play Store as a primary repository for apps.\nIn the title text Cueball succumbs to the consumerism and marvels at the Motorola Droid\'s high Pixel density. Apple responded 9 months later by releasing the iPhone 4 with a 326 ppi Retina Display.\n\n
