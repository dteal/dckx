While the comic is funny on its own in a "Wake Up, Sheeple" kind of way, the title text reveals that the comic is a parable about homeopathy. The comic title is a play on alternative medicine.

In the comic, it is implied that Cueball has been scammed into buying blank books, though he attempts to defend it as a valid choice. The title text likens this to the CVS Pharmacy selling homeopathic pills using methods that does not clearly distinguish them from traditional pharmaceuticals. Homeopathy is a pseudoscience based on the idea that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people will cure that disease in sick people, if administered in sufficiently small doses. It is possible that Cueball actually bought blank notebooks and is scamming himself into believing he made a valid and logical choice.

Homeopathic remedies are prepared by repeatedly diluting a substance with alcohol or water. Somewhat counter-intuitively, homeopathy considers the weakest dilutions to have the most powerful healing effect. Frequently, in fact, the dilutions are repeated past the point where any meaningful number of molecules of the "active ingredient" can remain.

Selling a homeopathic remedy as actual medicine when it is just water is analogous to selling blank books. The smudge of ink Cueball mentions in the comic may be referencing the fact that some of the less diluted homeopathic remedies can contain a tiny amount of the original substance.
