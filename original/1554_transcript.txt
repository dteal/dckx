n\nCueball and Megan are apparently playing a game in which they name all of the elements in some category. Cueball asks Megan to name all of the Spice Girls, a pop group whose nicknames were\n\nPosh Spice (Victoria Beckham)\nSporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm)\nScary Spice (Melanie Brown),\nGinger Spice (Geri Halliwell)\nBaby Spice (Emma Bunton)\n\nInstead, Megan winds up making up names by tacking "Spice" onto words from other, completely unrelated categories:\n\nFirst guess: The five human senses: Hearing, Vision, Smell, Touch, and Taste.\nSecond guess: The five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance.\nThird guess: The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: War, Famine, Plague, and Death.\nFourth guess: Words that are phonetically similar to the actual names: Pog (Posh), Story (Sporty), Sarah (Scary), Gender (Ginger), and Baleen (Baby).\n\nThis seems to be a continuation of 1417: Seven, where Megan asks Cueball to name the seven dwarfs. Apparently Megan confuses different sets of five (or four when she is not trying) which may be compared to the way Cueball mixes items from different sets of seven, thus not mentioning a full set, but just seven items from seven different sets of seven.\nThe title text has the correct "first" names of the Spice Girls, but replaces the "Spice" part of their names with "Extinction" to associate them with Earth\'s five mass extinctions. The five actual worst mass extinctions are:\n\nThe Ordovician-Silurian extinction,\nThe Late Devonian extinction,\nThe Permian-Triassic extinction,\nThe End Triassic extinction, and\nThe Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction.\n\nRandall previously referenced the Spice Girls in 1511: Spice Girl (more specifically, using "Which Spice Girl Are You?" as an example of online personality quizzes).\nAnd already in the next comic 1555: Exoplanet Names 2 he suggest to give five exoplanets around the same star the five nicknames.\n\n
