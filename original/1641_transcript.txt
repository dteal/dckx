n\nA common staple of trite comedy is "why do hot dogs come in packages of ten but hot dog buns in bags of eight?" The phenomenon is mildly frustrating for the consumer, as it often leaves leftover food. The most sinister result is the subsequent purchase of more buns, followed by more hot dogs, followed by more buns, over and over again until forty total hot dogs have been eaten (in a cycle similar to that shown in 140: Delicious).\nThe actual reason for the mismatch between hot dogs and buns, according to both Karl Smallwood and Cecil Adams, is that meat packers like things that come in pounds and bakers hate things that come in tens. Nonetheless, some smaller companies are starting to offer bags of ten buns, and several brands of hot dogs sell in packages of eight.\nHere, Cueball attempts to raise the question as he is standing with a package of hot dogs in one hand and a bag of buns in the other hand (presumably for their dinner), but a person offscreen interrupts him mid sentence and mentions condoms instead of buns. Cueball mulls the subject over in his mind, and when he realizes his friend is putting hot dogs in condoms, he is promptly grossed out.\nThe title text makes it clear that Cueball\'s new found association of hot dogs with sexual activity, has put him totally off the idea of eating any of them this evening, and he suggests ordering pizza, which he then can hope will not be used for this similar (NSFW) comparisons\xe2\x80\xa6 Cueball also asks that he and his friend never discuss this conversation again, due to the situation\'s awkwardness and uncomfortable subject matter.\nThe style of the conversation with Cueball asking, someone answering and Cueball saying Eww is similar to a situation in the game comic 1608: Hoverboard where a giant ant queen inside the Destroyer is provoking Cueball in the same way by talking about laying eggs like this:\n\nCueball: What\'s up?\nAnt queen: The usual. Poopin\' out ants.\nCueball: Eww.\n\n
