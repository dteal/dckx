n\nThe graph in the comic shows the enjoyability of movies - going from good to okay to bad, then popping back up with "So Bad It\'s Good". The term is used to describe movies that are so terrible that, for a variety of reasons, watching them can be considered an enjoyable experience. The comic lists Plan 9 from Outer Space and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, two widely known films of this type.\nHowever, the graph warns of showing The Star Wars Holiday Special, as it manages to wrap back around from "So Bad It\'s Good" to being So Bad it\'s Horrible. The Star Wars Holiday Special is a prime-time comedy special based on Star Wars. It is widely known for its terrible quality, and has never been fully released (although an animated segment that introduced Boba Fett, which George Lucas has approved of, has been released as a bonus feature on a DVD).\nThe bottom of the comic shows Cueball, Megan, and Ponytail watching a movie with alcohol - first enjoying it, then merely watching, then not watching it and unhappily drinking.\nThe title text refers to torrents, which are a way to obtain large amounts of data over the internet. Since the Holiday Special was only aired once on television and was never released on VHS or DVD, torrents of the TV recordings are one of the few ways to actually see it. According to Munroe, he had torrented a copy of the film and intended to watch it in its entirety, in spite of its terribleness, just to cement himself as a nerd. However, he underestimated how bad it really was, and could not make it all the way through.\nThe title text may also contain an subtle play on a line of Star Wars dialogue. In Return of the Jedi, Darth Vader says to Luke Skywalker, "Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don\'t know the power of the dark side! I must obey my master." The implication here being that "kitschy nerd cred" is the "dark side" being served by those who would sit through a torrent of the Star Wars Holiday Special.\n\n
