n\nSenator Grayton is a fictional character, made up for this comic, which is unusual for xkcd, which typically uses real-world references.\nThe issues that Grayton supports:\n\nTax Breaks to Drunk Drivers: Grayton proposes giving those who have been convicted of a DUI or DWI (i.e. Driving Under the Influence or Driving While Intoxicated) money back on their taxes, when those infractions are typically severely penalized, as drunk driving has resulted in numerous deaths.\nPredator Drones and the War on Christmas: The War on Christmas is not a real war; it is simply the perception by some Christians that non-Christians are trying to replace traditional Christmas imagery with more inclusive and generic holiday customs. No politicians have explicitly announced their support of the "War on Christmas," and the idea that one would not only do so, but would also want to use drones \xe2\x80\x94ostensibly to harm or possibly kill people\xe2\x80\x94 in the effort is an absurd exaggeration of a relatively harmless culture war.\n\nThe term percentage point is used to overcome an abiguity when comparing two percentages. Assuming an original sample of 1,000,000 people, where 20% approve of Senator Grayton. \nReduction of a stated number by a percentage\n\nWhen the original value is given as a number, there is no ambiguity. In the statement below the only possible conclusion is that now only 162,000 people approve of Grayton.\nPreviously 200,000 people approved of Senator Grayton, and then his approval rating dropped by 19%. \n\nReduction of a percentage by a percentage\n\nWhen the original approval rating is given as a percentage (20% in the comic), then a reduction of 19% has two possible meanings:\n1) Of the 20% who previously approved (200,000 people), 19% no longer approve. In this case the result is 162,000 as in the above example.\n2) Compared to the original results, 19% fewer of the entire original sample of 1 million people approve. In this case only 1% of the original 1 million approve, equal to 10,000 people.\n\nIf using the second method of comparing percentages, the approvals rating should be described as having dropped by 19 percentage points. In reality, the distinction between the two methods is often overlooked, leading to confusion.\nThe caption\'s issue with "percentage" versus "percentage points" is that if Grayton\'s 20% approval rating drops by 19%, that means that his support has only dropped 3.8 percentage points since 19% of 20% is only 3.8%. That would mean that even after all his outrageous statements, his support dropped only from 20% to 16.2%. However, if the news reports that his 20% approval rating dropped 19 percentage points, that means his support has dropped to 1%, which appears to be more accurate given Grayton\'s egregious policy decisions and the description of his campaign as having "imploded."\nReferences in the title text:\n\nTracy Morgan is an actor who plays Tracy Jordan in the TV Show 30 Rock. He has been reprimanded for controversial comments on homosexuals and Sarah Palin (in separate incidents).\nJohn Wilkes Booth is the person who assassinated Abraham Lincoln.

He suggests that all of modern physics is wrong, in addition to claiming that religion is evil, specifically Christianity, and that the idea of family is poisoning children.\nCollege Scholarships to Sexually Active Teens: Many people think adolescents should not engage in sexual activity, let alone encouraged to do so by college scholarships. This is the opposite of abstinence programs, which encourage teens not to be sexually active until marriage.\nIllegal immigrants who create room for themselves by killing a citizen: Illegal immigration is a highly controversial topic in the United States. One argument against illegal immigration is that illegal immigrants are taking jobs away from American citizens. Proponents of immigration assert that this is not the case, since more people in the overall economy creates jobs and brings in more tax revenue. Neither group would be in favor of illegal immigrants murdering citizens even though it would not result in a net gain or loss in population.\nGraduated income tax based on penis size: Many men are sensitive about their penis size and would probably consider the measurement of their penises for tax assessment purposes an enormous embarrassment and invasion of privacy. Even the scenario in which those with relatively smaller penises would be levied less tax than those with larger penises would probably not be sufficient for them to accept this policy, and even if they did, those with larger penises would probably consider this policy to be unfair. And the alternative - a scenario in which larger penises pay less taxes - would be both unfair and incredibly demeaning.\n\n
