n\nThis comic\'s use of Skynet is a reference to the main antagonist in the Terminator franchise. Skynet is a fictional artificial intelligence system which becomes self-aware and decides to terminate humanity, its creators. Skynet is rarely seen onscreen, with its actions often performed via robots, cyborgs (usually a Terminator), and other computer systems.\nThe final frame is a reference to semantic satiation; when you\'ve said or thought about a word too much, it can stop sounding like a real word and instead start sounding like nonsense. As it continues Skynet appears to come to self-aware realizations that usually are the result of drug usage.\nThe title text is a reference to one of the Terminator\'s first lines upon arrival in the 20th century. It combines this with a self-awareness statement of the type that\'s often used to annoy or distract someone: "You are now breathing manually." Similar statements include things like "Your clothes are touching your skin and you can feel it" and "[Name of earworm song] is playing in your head." Randall has done a comic before on this kind of thing.\n\n
