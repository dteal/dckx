n\nMiss Lenhart is back teaching a math class. She begins a proof when one of her students (Cueball) interrupts her asking if this is one of those dark-magic (unclear, incomprehensible) proofs. She says no, but it soon turns out that it is; Cueball exclaims that he just knew it would be.\nThe proof she starts setting up resembles a proof by contradiction. However, after Cueball\'s interruption Ms Lenhart\'s proof takes a turn for the absurd: rather than assuming there will be a point in the function that correlates to co-ordinates (x, y), Lenhart assumes that the act of writing numbers on the board will correlate to co-ordinates (x, y).\nA normal proof by contradiction assumes that a particular condition is true, and shows that this assumption leads to a contradiction, which disproves the initial assumption. For example assumption that \xe2\x88\x9a2 is a rational number means that, for some natural a and b, \xe2\x88\x9a2=a/b, where a/b is an irreducible fraction. Yet, multiplying this equation by itself, we get 2=a\xc2\xb2/b\xc2\xb2 which in turn rearranges to 2b\xc2\xb2=a\xc2\xb2. Therefore a\xc2\xb2 is even (as any integer multiplied by 2 is even), which means that a is an even number, as an even number squared is always even and an odd number squared is always odd. This means, that a=2k and 2b\xc2\xb2=(2k)\xc2\xb2=4k\xc2\xb2, meaning b\xc2\xb2=2k\xc2\xb2, so b must be even too. But if both a and b are even, a/b cannot be irreducible. Contradiction means that the initial assumption is false, and \xe2\x88\x9a2 cannot be a rational number.\nAlternatively, instead of a proof by contradiction the setup could be for a one way function. For example, it is relatively easy to test that a solution to a differential equation is valid but choosing the correct solution to test can seem like black magic to students.\nThe way that Ms Lenhart\'s proof refers to the act of doing math itself, is characteristic of metamathematical proofs, for example G\xc3\xb6del\'s incompleteness theorems, which, at first sight, may indeed look like black magic, even if in the end they must be a "perfectly sensible chain of reasoning" like the rest of good mathematics. While typical mathematical theorems and their proofs deal with such mathematical objects as numbers, functions, points or lines, the metamathematical theorems treat other theorems as objects of interest. In this way you can propose and prove theorems about possibility of proving other theorems. For example, in 1931 Kurt G\xc3\xb6del was able to prove that any mathematical system based on arithmetics (that is using numbers) has statements that are true, but can be neither proved nor disproved. This kind of metamathematical reasoning is especially useful in set theory, where many statements become impossible to prove and disprove if the axiom of choice is not taken as a part of the axiomatic system.\nUsing a position on the blackboard as a part of the proof is a joke, but it bears a resemblance to Cantor\'s diagonal argument where a position in a sequence of digits of a real number was a tool in a proof that not all infinite sets have the same cardinality (rough equivalent of the number of elements). This "diagonal method" is also often used in metamathematical proofs.\nThe axiom of choice itself states that for every collection of nonempty sets, you can have a function that draws one element from each set of the collection. This axiom, once considered controversial, was added relatively late to the axiomatic set theory, and even contemporary mathematicians still study which theorems really require its inclusion. In the title text the decision of whether to take the axiom of choice is made by a deterministic process, that is a process which future states can be developed with no randomness involved. Determinacy of infinite games is used as a tool in the set theory, however the deterministic process is rather a term of the stochastic processes theory, and the dynamical systems theory, branches of mathematics far from the abstract set theory, which makes the proof even more exotic. The axiom of choice was mentioned earlier in 804: Pumpkin Carving and later in 982: Set Theory, another comic about a math class with a similar theme on how teachers teach their student mathematical proofs.\nAlthough Miss Lenhart did retire a year ago after 1519: Venus, she seems to have returned here for a math course at university level, but continues the trend she finished with in her prior class.\n\n
