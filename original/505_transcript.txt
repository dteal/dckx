n\nCueball awakens to find himself trapped for eternity in an endless expanse of sand and rocks. At first, he uses this time to derive all of mathematics and physics, including quantum mechanics and general relativity. Next Cueball creates a computer that can process any possible function, out of rocks and rules for the interaction between rocks. He then simulates a particle followed by the interactions between particles, followed by the entire universe. The amount of time it takes to simulate the change in the universe from one instant to the next takes an extremely long time as the time it takes to update just one row of rocks can be measured in googols of years, assuming a realistic time to place each rock.\nCueball then apologizes for any flaws we see in the simulation. This implies that the audience is living in Cueball\'s simulation, making Cueball essentially God.\nThe final frame cuts to a classroom where a bored student stares at his hands waiting for class to end. Cueball admonishes the student for thinking that class is lasting forever. The joke being that the boredom felt in a classroom is nothing compared to the boredom that inspires Cueball to spend his time toiling to keep the universe moving. Indeed, the minutes of lecture actually took many "billions and billions of millennia" for Cueball to simulate.\nThe title text suggests that Rule 34 should be called on Wolfram\'s Rule 34. Rule 34 (see 305: Rule 34) is a humorous rule of the Internet which states "If you can imagine it, there is porn of it. No exceptions." Wolfram\'s Rule 34 is a cellular automaton. Therefore, the title text says that someone has made pornography featuring the cellular automaton in question.\n\n
