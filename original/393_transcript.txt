n\nGary Gygax was a game designer best known for co-creating the iconic nerd pastime Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D); as such, he is commonly described as the "father of D&amp;D." He died on March 4, 2008, three days before this comic was released. It made him the first person to receive tribute in conjunction with his death on xkcd, but not the last!\nThe idea of playing games (typically chess) with supernatural entities in exchange for one\'s soul is an old one and has been referenced in many works, but mainly known in the form of playing Chess against the personified version of Death, which was made famous in The Seventh Seal. The last part of this trope is used in this comic. Here, the specific twist is that the victim can choose which game they want to play. Naturally, it is only fitting that Gary would challenge Death to D&amp;D.\nThe problem is that Dungeons and Dragons isn\'t so much a game as it is a set of rules for describing stories. It requires the intervention of a Dungeon Master (or DM) to create a scenario which the players\' characters must overcome. It\'s unclear exactly how the game between Gary and Death works, but given that D&amp;D generally takes a long time to play due to the setup time and large amount of dice-rolling, and the fact that Gary seems to keep adding extra rulebooks (official or pseudo-official books which add new classes, items, spells, etc. for players to use), it\'s understandable why it would take longer than Death\'s boss would like.\nPart of the humor in this comic comes from the fact that Death\'s boss, who would presumably be an extraordinarily powerful entity, appears to be a completely ordinary man in an ordinary office, complete with bald patch and potted plant.\nDeath\'s usage of the name "Jesus" in the final panel may be considered ironic given that he\'s, well, Death.\n\n
