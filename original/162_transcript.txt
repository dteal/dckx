n\nA moving object (like the Earth) has momentum. Momentum is the mass (size) of the object multiplied by the velocity (speed) of the moving object. So the Earth moving around the Sun has a very high momentum because the Earth has a large mass (size) and is moving at a high velocity (speed).\nA moving object has to keep moving at the same velocity for its momentum to stay the same. The momentum of a moving object can increase, decrease, or stop via the force of another object. Force is the transfer of momentum from one object to another.\nMegan attempts to slow down the Earth\'s momentum, and spins counter-clockwise to force her momentum onto the Earth, so that she can spend more time with the one she loves. Of course, the few nanoseconds gained by her spinning aren\'t enough to give her more time with Cueball, because she spends her time spinning instead of being with Cueball.\nThe Earth has a massively high momentum, and the momentum that she produces is minuscule relative to the Earth\'s. And the title text implies that this isn\'t possible: While not being able to reverse time, enjoy your night time. Sunrise always comes too early.\nThe total duration of a human lifetime is measured in physical time. The total duration of a human life is constantly depleting at a constant velocity. So even if she were able to slow down physical time, that would not increase the total duration of a human lifespan. \nHer attempt, and her feat, of overcoming the seemingly impossible is grand; and culturally, we value this kind of high romanticism.\nLater in 442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel the same kind of spinning Megan is used in the first frame to tell that xkcd loves momentum.\nTechnical notes: Angular momentum depends on the axis used for measuring angular momentum.\n\n
