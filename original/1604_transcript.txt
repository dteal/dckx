n\nIn the comic, Megan confuses a popular method of identification of the dangerous North American coral snake by its red, yellow, and black stripes with the color-coding system used to indicate the resistance of electrical resistors.\nThe coral snake has red bands adjacent to its yellow bands. However, coral snakes are mimicked by nonvenomous species with similar coloring, such as the milk snake, whose red bands are not adjacent to its yellow bands. This has led to a variety of rhyming mnemonics, such as \xe2\x80\x9cRed touches yellow, kill a fellow; red touches black, friend of Jack.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because Megan is describing a red band being adjacent to a yellow band, she is indeed holding a coral snake, which contains the most potent venom of any snake in North America. This assumes, of course, that the comic takes place in North America. The familiar mnemonic does not apply to South and Central American coral snakes.\nInstead of realizing the danger, Megan equates the color bands to having the same function as those printed on electrical resistors. Resistors have at least three bands to identify their resistance value in ohms, followed by an optional fourth band showing the tolerance as within the bounds of a certain percentage of the aforementioned resistance value. A red band followed by a yellow and a black one identifies a 24 ohm resistor (the Omega symbol, \xe2\x80\x9c\xce\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d, stands for ohms). As per the mnemonic, North American coral snakes have an additional yellow band between the black band and the next red band. Yellow corresponds to a tolerance of &#177;5%, so the actual resistance will be between 22.8\xce\xa9 and 25.2\xce\xa9. See this resistor code calculator. Resistor color codes were also mentioned in 227: Color Codes.\nThe title text refers to the fourth band specifying the tolerance but interprets it as the snake\'s tolerance for being held before biting, instead of the measure of the imprecision of the 24 ohms. In the case of yellow, this would refer to a tolerance value of 5%. How tolerance to being held is measured left ambiguous. If the value represents the probability of being bitten over a given period of time, then larger numbers would mean a less tolerant snake.  If it instead represents the position on some per-determined "tolerance scale" between 0 and 1, then larger values would represent a \'more\' tolerant snake.\n\n
