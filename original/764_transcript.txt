n\nThe comic parodies Sesame Street, an American children\'s TV show. The Count is a character in Sesame Street who teaches counting to viewers. The Count usually laughs after counting numbers, an innocent version of the sinister laugh that is a stereotype of old Hollywood horror films. In the book One Two Three ... Infinity, the writer describes African tribes that only have words for numbers up to three and their inability to distinguish or comprehend larger numbers.\nIn the title text Randall predicts that anthropology majors will write to complain that this view of primitive tribes is a myth no longer held true by today\'s anthropologists. He makes a jab at them saying they would have time to write letters to complain about things because they don\'t have to spend time doing real science and thus real research.\n\n
