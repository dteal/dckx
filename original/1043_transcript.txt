n\nThis comic plays with the Google trends for the terms "blog", "tumblr", "wordpress", and "livejournal".\n\nBlog: a website with opinions and comments\nTumblr: a "micro-blogging" site, which has taken off due to the prevalence of animated gifs and funny photos.\nWordPress: a type of blog software.\nLiveJournal: a sort of personal blog site that hasn\'t been very popular since 2004-2005. Randall published his first comics there.\n\nAs you can see in the caption and then the title text, there is no way that newscasters will reference the "Tumblverse" because all the reactions will be filled with animated gifs of a person in a raptor suit falling over or a dog answering a phone.\nThis actually came to pass, with the change over occurring between October and November 2012, as can be seen using the link above.\n\n
