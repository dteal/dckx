n\nCueball and Megan refer to the practice of tricking people to see shock sites using bait-and-switch pranks. A shock site is a website that is intended to be offensive, disgusting and/or disturbing to its viewers, containing materials of high shock value which is also considered distasteful and crude, and is generally of a pornographic, scatological, extremely violent, insulting, painful, profane, or otherwise provocative nature.\nThis comic is a direct reference to the former shock site goatse.cx that displayed a human distended anus (among other things). The domain was taken down in 2004, but it remains a memorable cultural reference from its time period. It therefore may be cited as nostalgia by trolls in the future. This comic evidently takes place in the future, as the characters are using some sort of advanced levitation technology which has yet to exist.\nIf you ignore the warning from the title text and Google for "distended anus" you will find many results on this awful dysfunction like rectal prolapse.\nFurthermore, the aforementioned shock site still exists at DISTENDED ANUS WARNING! http://goatse.info/.\n\n
