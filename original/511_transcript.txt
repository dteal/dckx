n\nMegan is seen leaving an apartment, trudging through freezing temperatures and foul weather, when she could be in a warm, cozy bed. The dialog is likely her thoughts, rather than speech. She is fed up with the second person\'s endless discussion of Digital rights management (DRM). She probably agrees with his position, but would rather face the weather than his endless rehashing of the issue.\nThe words in the first panel are the opening lyrics of the Christmas standard, Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!.\nIn the last panel, Free Culture refers to a book by Lawrence Lessig, who advocates for fewer restrictions in many areas. Randall had previously advocated this title himself in 86: Digital Rights Management and 129: Content Protection, and mentioned Lessig in 343: 1337: Part 3.\nIn the title text, it is revealed that Megan herself is also guilty of droning on about \'boring\' subjects, likely to the annoyance of those around her. In this case complaining about science-fiction TV series Battlestar Galactica which tends to produces strong reactions among geeks. She has gone outside to avoid the boring rant, however given the opportunity, it is her that would be doing the ranting.\n\n
