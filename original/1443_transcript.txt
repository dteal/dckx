n\nParts of speech can be treated fluidly, in English and other languages. For example, "medalled" has been coined as a word meaning "gained a medal" in a sporting competition, implying the existence of the verb "to medal" meaning "to win a medal". Megan, in conversation with Cueball, similarly creates new meanings from existing words: firstly, she uses the adjective "legit" (a slang abbreviation of "legitimate") as an adverb to mean "legitimately"; secondly, she uses the noun "adverb" as a verb meaning "to turn a non-adverb into an adverb"; and thirdly, she uses the noun phrase "language nerd" as an adjective. All three are used in the past tense.\nMegan uses the words "verbed" and "adjectived" without any comment, implying that the acts of "verbing" the nouns "verb" and "adjective" are so natural and long-established that they are unremarkable (although the fact that "adjectived" came after "verbed" may also have something to do with the latter\'s non-mention), even if grammatical purists might decry such usage. An example of a change of parts of speech that is widely accepted is the gerund, which is nothing more than the use of a verb or verb-phrase as a noun; for instance, "I enjoy reading," and "the best thing for your health is not smoking".\nAdded humor is gained by the self-referential nature of Megan\'s sentence. She uses fluid parts of speech, and also refers to that very same use, in one sentence.\nThe title text, "Not to go all sentence fragment on you," is an implicitly self-referential sentence fragment, containing neither an explicit subject nor a predicate. It can be converted into a full sentence by rephrasing it something like, "I do not mean to go all sentence fragment on you, but..."  It is also funnier because, as well as being self-referential, it also refers to the main comic by adjectiving the noun-phrase "sentence fragment".\n\n
