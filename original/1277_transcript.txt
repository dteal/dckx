n\nThe comic is an attack on the problems with the philosophy of "Objectivism". White Hat explains to Cueball a program he wrote, the "Ayn Random Number Generator", which is a pun on Ayn Rand, the name of a writer who created a philosophical system known as Objectivism. The joke is an attack on her philosophy, which claims to be a completely fair mechanism for distributing resources, but inherently favors those who start out with more resources, or already in a position to acquire the resources. It also has a strong overarching theme that people that believe in objectivism are inherently better than other people, and thus deserve what extra resources can be acquired - as with the Ayn Random Number Generator, which claims to be completely fair and balanced, but actually favors some numbers - which White Hat explains by saying that they deserve to come up more because they\'re inherently better.\nNow, objectivists, of course, would challenge the above portrayal, but the joke is, in the end, an attack on Ayn Rand\'s philosophies. A more nuanced description is that objectivists believe that the primary aim of life is to maximise personal happiness. In their view, if some humans are born more capable of satisfying their desires than other people, they deserve to reap greater rewards from life than others, no matter the cost to those others.\nAs an aside, "biased" random number generators exist. They\'re called weighted random number generators, and they have many practical applications when the programmer isn\'t lying about the number generator\'s function and output.\nThe title text identifies a group of people whose names match the regular expression /(\\b[plurandy]+\\b&#160;?){2}/i. A step-by-step explanation of the expression:\n\n\\b is a word boundary, matching anywhere there is a \'word character\' next to a non-word character\xe2\x80\x94punctuation, digit, spacing, etc.\n[plurandy] is a character class, and will match any single character from the set inside the square brackets; [adlnpruy] means exactly the same\nthe plus sign means one or more of the previous thing, so [plurandy]+ matches one or many of the characters in that class, one after the other\n"&#160;?" - a space followed by a question mark:  "?" means "0 or 1 of the previous thing", so a space is optional\nthe whole section in parentheses (\\b[plurandy]+\\b&#160;?) translates to "a word containing one or more letters, all of which are in the set [plurandy], followed by an optional space"\nthe {2} on the end means to repeat the pattern, so it must match exactly twice\nThe slashes at each end mark out the pattern, and the "i" at the end is an expression qualifier means it is "case insensitive" (uppercase and lowercase match interchangeably)\n\nOverall, it matches two words separated by a space, composed entirely of the letters in [plurandy], which is what all the names listed have in common.\n\n\n\n\n Person \n Brief Description\n\n\n Ayn Rand \n Author, best known for her novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.\n\n\n Paul Ryan \n US Politician known to have been influenced by the writings of Ayn Rand.\n\n\n Rand Paul \n US Politician, also influenced by Ayn Rand\'s writings.\n\n\n Ann Druyan \n Author, widow of Carl Sagan\n\n\n Paul Rudd \n Actor, screenwriter, comedian\n\n\n Alan Alda \n Actor, best known for the role of Hawkeye Pierce in the TV series M*A*S*H.
