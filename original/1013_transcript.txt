n\nCueball is going through the traditional street-protester refrain about the government having control over our lives and shouts "wake up, sheeple!" through a megaphone. Sheeple is a portmanteau of sheep and people used as a derisive term to describe people who thoughtlessly wander through their daily lives going exactly where they are "herded" by the powers that be.\nHowever, in this comic, the Sheeple are gigantic humanoid sheep-men who have slumbered beneath the Earth for ten thousand years, and whom Cueball has inadvertently awoken with his repeated mantra (much as in 555: Two Mirrors). The Sheeple appear to be some kind of eldritch abomination who will destroy the human race, and Cueball seems to be the only one previously unaware of their existence.\nThe title text says the humans will be led "like lambs to the slaughter" which is a phrase that appears many times in older texts, the Bible as an example. The phrase means that someone or something would be led to its destruction without it thinking to escape from the disaster. The Sheeple are likely to take it amiss, because it indicates the uncaring frequency with which humans kill sheep.\nSee more Sheeple-related comics at Category:Sheeple.\n\n
