n\nBefore starting xkcd, Randall worked on robotics at NASA\'s Langley Center. This drawing was apparently made during that period, while attending a talk that he didn\'t like.\nThe name of the comic is a portmanteau-like play on the following:\n\n G\xc3\xb6del, Escher, Bach is a book by Douglas Hofstadter. He is an American author who has written several books about philosophy, mathematics, and science. This particular book is his most famous one, about "strange loops", self-reference, and recurring patterns, partially shown through the works of the three people in its title:\n Kurt G\xc3\xb6del was a 20th-century mathematician most famous for proving that in our commonly used axiomatic systems, there are true propositions that cannot be proved from the axioms. His proof used a self-referential paradox.\n M. C. Escher was a 20th-century artist most famous for mathematically-inspired engravings of tessellated animals, impossible scenes, fractals, and so on. The form of this strip resembles one of his Metamorphosis etchings.  \n Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer and musician from the Baroque Period, famous for numerous works such as the Brandenburg Concertos.\n\n\n Kurt Halsey is a comic artist from Oregon. His work often contains introspective philosophical musings. At least one phrase in the letter is attributed to Halsey, "The past is just practice".\n\nThe comic is drawn in the form of a storyboard and is clearly intended to be visualized as an animated sequence.\nIn the first part of the comic, two people discuss the difficulty of comparing past and present generations, since the person making the comparison invariably belongs to one of the two groups.\nIt\'s unclear whether the hatted guy is Black Hat, because Randall hadn\'t standardized his character designs yet. The sarcastic comment suggests that it is. If it is, then this would be his first appearance. (He also appears in 12: Poisson but that comic was released about 3 month later, but the numbering did not follow the release day on LiveJournal when the comics were transferred to xkcd - see the trivia for that comic.)\nThe assembly of text panels found in the middle of the strip is similar to his 124: Blogofractal.\nThe philosophy of Kurt G\xc3\xb6del is also a theme here: 468: Fetishes.\n\n
