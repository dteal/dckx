n\nThis is a reference to the 1989 documentary Roger &amp; Me, in which director Michael Moore attempted to confront General Motors CEO Roger E. Smith over the company\'s closure of factories in his home town of Flint, Michigan. Moore uses the documentary to demonstrate his belief that the factory closures had a crippling effect on the local economy, and his objective is to ask the CEO pointedly about GM\'s disregard for the lives affected by their business decisions.\nIn this strip, Beret Guy mirrors Moore\'s determination to speak with the CEO of the auto company Volvo Cars, only to reveal that his burning question is actually trivial and juvenile in nature. "Stephen" is probably Steve Odell, the CEO of Volvo Cars in 2009, a subsidiary of Ford by that time, and later taken over by the Chinese company Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.\n\n
