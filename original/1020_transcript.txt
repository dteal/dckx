n\nThe Orion nebula is a diffuse nebula situated south of the three stars that compose Orion\'s Belt in the Orion constellation. In terms of the comic, it is the middle "star" in the sword/dong of Orion. Dong is an American slang word for penis. The star appears fuzzy to sharp-eyed observers, and the nebulosity is obvious through binoculars or a small telescope.\nWhen the speaker says "We are no strangers to controversy" he is probably referring to Pluto\'s demotion from planet to a dwarf planet/plutoid. It could also be a reference to Rick Astley\'s song "Never gonna give you up", the original line is "We\'re no strangers to love".\nThe title text is a quip about how small and off-kilter the hips are in Orion the constellation compared to the rest of its body.\n\n
