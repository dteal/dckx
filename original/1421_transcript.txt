n\nThis comic is a joke about how the person you were in the past can be viewed as a distinct entity from who you are now, as well as the predictability of future events relating to your future actions.\nThe comic shows comments, informational notes left in the code that do not change the algorithm, from a project completed by Cueball some time ago that is still being used and maintained.  It is implied that Cueball is looking at these comments because the algorithm, a parsing function, is no longer working. These comments were written by Cueball\'s "younger self" in anticipation of being read by his "older self" at a date close to the present. The function has held up to the younger Cueball\'s expectations as it has lasted until the publication date of this comic, September 2014. The comments indicate a firm belief that the parsing function could not be easily "re-kludged" to handle the new situation but instead would need to be re-written.\nThese comments are surprisingly accurate, leading Cueball to rhetorically reply to his younger self that these comments were creepy. Cueball\'s "younger self" must have anticipated a snarky reply and reminded his older self that his older self has likely not fulfilled his dream of going to Iceland. Cueball again replies that his younger self should stop judging him. \nIn the title text, current-day Cueball lashes out at his younger self, further emphasizing the way he is viewing his past self as a different person, blaming the ineffectiveness of his past self\'s coding for never going to Iceland.\n\n
