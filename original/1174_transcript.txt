n\nSome web sites have a mobile app designed for use on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. In theory this is because the main website will be more difficult to navigate on the small screen of a mobile, or some features won\'t work. In practice, this alternative is frequently worse than simply viewing the standard web page, for reasons offered in the comic:\n\nYou cannot zoom or change the text size in most of these apps, a feature available on mobile browsers.\nThe app is often of poor quality and is incomplete, lacks part of the content, or lacks features available on the standard web site.\n\nThe comic offers a brutally honest version of such a promotional popup. Alternatively to an app, some sites have a mobile version which is still an HTML-based website - just one that has been designed for mobile. These mobile versions (often denoted by being in an "m." subdomain) often have the same issues as above, or worse, because the sites do not have the benefit of the programmability of an app.\nCompounding the frustration is that some sites aggressively promote their app/mobile version with a popup message that repeats the suggestion on every visit to the site, and as the title text notes, if you reject the popup, you end up on the site\'s homepage, rather than the subpage you may have been trying to reach via a web search. A similar effect (where the mobile version will only load the site\'s main page) is described in more detail in 869: Server Attention Span.\n\n
