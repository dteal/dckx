n\nThis comic is a take on the instructions "Remember to use a #2 pencil on the Scantron" that most modern students have heard something approaching a billion times. Scantrons are standardized machine-readable papers used by students to answer multiple-choice tests. Often, the instructor will remind students to use a #2 pencil, which is the US term for the pencil hardness HB. HB pencils use a medium-hardness graphite considered ideal for Scantron use because the graphite is soft enough to leave a dark mark but hard enough to not smudge, both aspects that improve the performance of machine-readable paper. Miss Lenhart seems to have given her class one of these tests.\nThe joke is that the student used a #3 pencil, which has a slightly harder graphite rating, on the Scantron as opposed to a #2 pencil. Instructors and examiners usually place great emphasis on using a #2 pencil, as if not using one would lead to dire consequences. The comic jokingly suggests that these consequences would include causing the grading machine to explode, harming people nearby.\nThe title text refers to the instruction to "fill in all the bubbles completely." This again improves the performance of machine-readable paper. Randall states that he spent an inordinate amount of time making sure his markings were perfect because he had been warned so many times to do so, but five seconds are usually enough.\nThis is the first of only two comics where Miss Lenhart is both drawn and named, the second being 1050: Forgot Algebra.\n\n
