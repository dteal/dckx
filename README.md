##Usage

This program requires Python 3 with Pillow and nltk (including the nltk
corpus) installed as well as an internet connection.

Run dckx.py with command line arguments. Said arguments, forming, ostensibly,
a headline, will be elucidatingly reinterpreted via XKCD conglomeration.

##Preprocessing

In order to run, dckx has a large precollated library of source material.
The materials consists of webscraped XKCD graphics, caption text, and
executive summaries drawn from explainxkcd.com. The database generation code,
in modular form, is in getxkcd.py, parser.py, and contourtest.py.

	Program: getxkcd.py
	Input: (none)
	Output:
		image files in /originals/, e.g., dckx/originals/971.png
		summary text in /originals/, e.g., dckx/original/971_transcript.txt
		list of comic numbers in /originals/index.txt

	Program: parser.py
	Input: (none)
	Output:
		image files in /originals/, e.g., dckx/originals/971.png
		summary text in /originals/, e.g., dckx/original/971_summary.txt
		list of comic numbers in /originals/index.txt

	Program: contourtest.py
	Requirements: OpenCV
	Input: (none)
	Output:
		image files in /originals/, e.g., dckx/originals/971.png
		summary text in /originals/, e.g., dckx/original/971_transcript.txt
		list of comic numbers in /originals/index.txt

##Postprocessing

Input is tokenized by dckx.py, then fed into search.py, which uses
several techniques to match each token to a proper comic panel. These
panels are recombined in an output comic, which is displayed for the
user's convenience.

##Authorship

dckx was authored by Annie, Brian, Daniel, Kevin, and Zach during HackTX 2016.
