* Dreadfully Creative Klaxon Xylophone
* Deeply Concerning Knews eXceptor
* Daleks Can be Killed by X-rays
* Don't Care, Keep Xeroxing

Current plan:

We'll have multiple little sub-programs, each with a specific task.

##Preprocessing

Daniel: program to download XKCD images and Explain XKCD text to numbered
PNG and text files, respectively.

	Program: getxkcd.py

Brian: program to take each png comic and output individual panels as
separate images (and the number of images).

Zach: program to take each text file from Explain XKCD and the number of
panels, and to output a text file containing relevant text for each panel.

##Postprocessing

Kevin: program that takes input from user and ends up with a number of panels
needed and relevant text to describe each panel.

	Program: ui.py

Annie: program that matches a bit of text to the most relevant panel
description.
