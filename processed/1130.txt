n this is a comic about the 2012 us presidential election as it was posted the day before the election on november 6 2012 this tuesday it is the third comic on the subject the previous two being 1122 electoral precedent and 1127 congress and the next comic 1131 math continues the issue raised in this one in the comic cueball is glued to his laptop reading media coverage of the election the offscreen character remarks that cueball should take a break suggesting that cueball has been reading media coverage for quite a while cueball is so caught up in media coverage that he is speculating on the effect that incumbent president obama winning the election and the resulting news coverage could have on challenger mitt romney's campaign the joke is that the end goal of romney's campaign is to win the election if obama wins the campaigning is already over regardless of media coverage cueball is simply so invested that he overanalyzes potential scenarios and fails to see the big picture specifically he has become so concerned with following the polls that he's lost sight of their purpose as a predictive tool after the election is over polling becomes trivial since the result they are intended to forecast is already known and so in reality will not be conducted at all this is possibly intended as a rebuke to those pundits talking heads who seemingly care more about or whose jobs are contingent on caring more about the game of analyzing and predicting the politics of the race rather than caring about the actual policies the candidates are likely to pursue after coming into office the title text repeats this theme with nate silver an american statistician psephologist and writer among other things he has a political blog called fivethirtyeight which was originally written under a pseudonym the blog and its associated website primarily discuss tracking polls in respect to elections thus the choices made on tuesday election day will have massive and permanent effects on fivethirtyeight's charts which will obviously change to reflect the actual votes cast xe2x80x94 but all the charts will have become trivial since the purpose of the blog is to predict the results this is a parody of the bold statements often made during campaigns such as that the choices made on election day could have massive and permanent effects on such things as your health care the economy your job etc polls and pundits are also referenced in the next comic 1131 math published the day after the election
