n cueball and megan are studying a fungus that takes over the brains of mammals and makes them want to study the fungus this is a reproductive tactic by the fungus since the fungus makes the mammal whose brain it took over want to study the fungus which means that mammal will need to produce more of the fungus to study it cueball and megan are most likely themselves being controlled by the fungus since they tell ponytail that they want to cultivate the fungus as much as possible the title of the comic refers to mycology the study of fungi this is likely a reference to various species of cordyceps fungi which can infect the brains of insects causing behavior advantageous to the reproduction or spread of the fungus this also may be an allusion to another fungus ophiocordyceps unilateralis which manipulates its hosts to aid its propagation toxoplasma gondii is also known to alter the behavior of mammals and some researchers have proposed that this parasite may be partly responsible for the cat lady phenomenon whereby humans are compelled to hoard cats the comic and its subtitle may in fact be a subtle argument that human behavior and the entire concept of free will may need to be re evaluated given the massive numbers of human parasites known to exist in evolutionary biology the phenomenon of an organism influencing its environment sometimes by modifying the behavior of other organisms is known as xe2x80x9cthe extended phenotypexe2x80x9d richard dawkins wrote a book of that name as a follow up of xe2x80x9cthe selfish genexe2x80x9d where he describes this mechanism as an extreme example of the so called selfishness of genes the title text parodies numerous conspiracy theories by suggesting that corn which has been propagated by humans throughout large parts of the world is actually just a fungus that has used humans and is not a grain at all this type of theory is remarkably similar to the brain in a vat thought experiment and to the isaac asimov short story each an explorer in both cases something has affected the perception of the mind itself making it impossible to discern the true reality of something in practical terms there would be little difference between this conspiracy theory and the reality as it posits the fungus corn would be the same food that humans have already been cultivating for food for millennia unless of course this fungus's stalks have no nutritional value and it's only been making us think that it's a food and those of us who live on corn are starving without realizing it conspiracy theories is a recurring subject on xkcd
