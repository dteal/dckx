n the crypto nerd would be concerned with strongly encrypting data on their personal machine this would conceivably come in handy when villains attempt to steal information on his computer the crypto nerd imagines that due to his advanced encryption the crackers will be ultimately defeated randall suggests that in the real world people with the desire to access this information would simply use torture to coerce the nerd to give them the password both panels also reference the amount of money used to access the data in the first the villain is willing to use millions of dollars to construct a super computer while in the second he simply uses a $5 wrench the comic effectively states completely accurately that the weakest part of computer security is not the computer but the user rsa is a commonly used public key encryption method current standards typically use 1024 2048 and more recently 4096 bit keys these encryption methods are not yet feasibly breakable a 4096 bit key will remain unbreakable for the foreseeable future the title text pokes fun at typical users who do not have data that would be worth anything to anyone but themselves therefore it is unlikely that the above situation would ever occur additionally the wrench used in the second panel is large and presumably more than the $5 referenced by the thug
