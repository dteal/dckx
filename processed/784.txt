n the first few panels of this strip seem romantic and sentimental as it's common to hear that people sleep better next to people they love the last panel reveals that cueball and megan are actually going through some relationship trouble because cueball uses her presence as a good reason for leaving this world behind he does however not intend to commit suicide to escape from her and the world; he just wishes to escape by falling asleep as the title text reveals he also wishes to avoid her in his dreams as he wishes their dreams do not intersect ie he hopes he will not dream of her and vice versa the cartoon seems to be a homage to the webcomic a softer world which takes the same format
