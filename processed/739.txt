n a malapropism is the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound resulting in a nonsensical utterance  an example of a malapropism is yogi berra's statement texas has a lot of electrical votes rather than electoral votes a portmanteau is a word made up of two or more combined words and their definitions for example motel is a portmanteau from the words motor and hotel a neologism is simply a newly coined word that is not yet in common use  here randall shows a hypothetical wikipedia page of the word malamanteau which is both a portmanteau of malapropism and portmanteau and a malapropism of portmanteau finally malamanteau is itself a neologism the methods used to create this new word are the very words used in the process this is called a meta or self referential joke malamanteau was originally coined in 2007 when it was proposed by user ludwig_van on metafilter as a term for language errors like flustrated flustered &amp; frustrated and misconscrewed misconstrued &amp; screwed  the bottom line of the comic ever notice how wikipedia has a few words it really likes is a reference to the large number of wikipedia pages that start by labeling their subject matter as a malapropism a portmanteau or a neologism  in response to this comic editors at wikipedia created a malamanteau page it was deleted multiple times and eventually turned into a redirect to the wikipedia page for xkcd malamanteau and the controversy at wikipedia got coverage at the economist and the boston globe the title text refers to wikipedia's requirements of citations for a page on there to exist it also refers to the wide range of places citations can be obtained from showing a direct opposition due to the use of very different citations the language log arguments are modern and informal whereas the obscure manuscript is formal and much older language log is a blog that posts content relating to language and linguistics including things like malapropisms and portmanteaus while an informal source it has produced new linguistic terms before such as eggcorn its comments sections frequently contain discussions and arguments about english whose participants are probably the same people who write wikipedia articles about linguistic phenomena like malamanteaux the fact that no modern citation could be found outside of language log comments implies that the malamanteau is not a widely recognized or studied concept but one invented by amateur linguists malamanteau did not appear on language log until after this strip malamanteau has since been referenced on the language log website with a link to the comic in question language log has referenced xkcd many times before reposting the comics and linking to the xkcd website the citation of a document from the 1490s is a reference to the fact that linguists like those who post on language log often use old documents as evidence possibly to prove that a construction is a longstanding feature of the language however if such an archaic citation is the only evidence of the term's use then it is unlikely to be a notable feature worthy of a wikipedia article further the title text implies that the fictional article isn't exactly the most stable inside the fictional wikipedia's userbase or otherwise is being subject to some severe favoritism since malamanteau hasn't been used at any time since the feudal ages and its most recent citations are a borderline flame war on another website most articles that are only cited by a single website tend to get deleted unless the subject has achieved significant coverage in outside news media
