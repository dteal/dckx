n for most people under most circumstances a flashlight's water resistance is a completely moot point as most flashlight use occurs on dry land but as randall has shown before there is a tendency for people to imagine elaborate scenarios in which an extra edge would be useful in the dream sequence over the first 2 and a half frames cueball appears to be diving to find a key underwater which he spots using his flashlight when he is at 8 meters his flashlight goes out at 10 meters because he bought the hi brite model the dream sequence also references a radio shed which were only really used in the past for amateur radios or some other military style bases/compoundsxe2x80x94which would align with his warn the president line the title text takes cueball's thought process to the next level if he is getting a flashlight that works to 40 meters worst case he should probably be prepared for even deeper waters as well even worse case however this is seen as ridiculous from his friend since the more durable model costs $25 more in return however he replies that you never know what situation you'd be in
