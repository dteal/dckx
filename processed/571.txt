n cueball is in bed and is having trouble sleeping he tries the old standby of counting sheep as they jump over a fence but upon reaching 32767 sheep 65536 sheep jump back over the fence and start counting up again from32768 this is because when a whole number or integer is represented in a digital form such as on a computer the number's range is limited by the amount of space used to store it when the greatest possible number given the storage space is exceeded an arithmetic overflow occurs which may result depending on the used language among other things in starting over at the least possible number given the storage space this is not at all unlike a car's odometer imagine an odometer with six digits reaching 999999 upon driving one more mile or km the digits will roll back over to 000000 causing or failing to prevent integer overflow is a common mistake by programmers that may have software security consequences some languages like c/c++ even leaves the signed integer overflow undefined behavior it may or may not wrap to the beginning the instruction can be ignored or may cause the software to crash  in this case the least and greatest possible numbers are32768 and 32767 which implies that the storage space used would be two bytes in addition it's clear that the number is designated as a signed number meaning that it can be either positive or negative however even if cueball had this limitation it would never actually pose a problem by 32767 sheep at a rate of one sheep per second cueball has been counting for over nine hours this would signify that he has extreme insomnia and probably needs treatment and also that he has spent the entire night counting and therefore would just get up and start the day rather than count sheep all over again from32768 moreover according to an experiment conducted by researchers at oxford university counting sheep is actually an inferior means of inducing sleep see the wikipedia article the title text refers to the 1968 philip k dick science fiction novel do androids dream of electric sheep which was adapted into the perhaps more widely known ridley scott directed 1982 film blade runner the implication is that if we ever do create androids that dream of electric sheep we should make sure to give them sufficient storage space to store numbers large enough such that an arithmetic overflow will be far less likely to occur even if they count for a long time a long int consists of four bytes rather than two so instead of being limited to a range from32768 to 32767 the number will be capable of storing numbers from2147483648 to 2147483647 sheepcount is a possible name for a variable to be used in a computer program declaring a variable tells the computer that it should allocate a portion of memory to be associated with the variable name given for those who might be unfamiliar with common programming practices sheepcount is named using what is commonly referred to as camelcase meaning that all words in the name sheep and count are pushed together and the first letter of every word after the first is capitalized this is one of several common approaches to naming variables in computer programming
