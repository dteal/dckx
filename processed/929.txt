n during a basketball game the players discuss the nature of universal conformity facebook and google+ are competing social networks at the time of this comic many people were switching to plus over facebook leading many to speculate that facebook was in decline and that plus would soon be the dominant social network the two players seem to have a disagreement over this one player states that it would be ridiculous to expect everyone to move to plus the other player denies the notion that they have to valuing his personal preference over conformity he supports this by saying that his mother still uses aol and other people continue using irc if each time a new dominant social network emerged and everyone switched to it neither of these things would stick around they are interrupted when they pass the ball to black hat who immediately shoots it with a crossbow bolt their arguments and rather intelligent discussion are derailed by the absurdity of black hat's reaction which is both humorous and puts the issue in stark contrast black hat neither joins in the discussion nor does he participate in the game and it seems that any offer to participate in either is met with a blunt and clear denial he is simply not a conformist in the title text black hat continues to provide an example of his tendency to play by his own rules a clay pigeon is a clay disc that is thrown into the air and serves as a target on a skeet shooting range participants are expected to shoot the pigeons with a shotgun but black hat would rather capture the clay pigeons and shoot them from a very close range this is made even more humorous by the excellent crossbow skills he shows in the comic this practice eventually got him expelled from the shooting range
