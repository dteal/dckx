n in the first panel a cross sectional drawing of a plane wing with the air moving around the wing showing a common teaching that an airfoil works because the air on top of the wing must travel faster to keep up with the air flowing across the bottom of the wing the theory goes that because the air on top of the wing is traveling faster it must as a result of bernoulli's principle create an area of lower pressure above the wing; this causes lift that is the wing rises because the higher pressure below the wing symbolized by thick up arrow pushes it up more than the low pressure above the wing this is what the teacher miss lenhart is teaching as is revealed in the next panel as it turns out this is to put it mildly a vast oversimplification of how lift is truly created because then a student asks a particularly insightful question why if the theory is true can planes fly upside down if the simple airfoil theory is all that permits planes to stay up in the air then flying upside down should reverse the pressures xe2x80x94 pushing the plane down and causing it to crash miss lenhart thinks about it and clearly has no answer the final set of panels posit three potential responses from miss lenhart upon realizing her theory has been disproved  in the right one miss lenhart realizes that perhaps the model she's been using to explain how an airfoil works is wrong or at a minimum too simple she is curious about it and suggests that this is an area for further exploration and encourages additional study xe2x80x94 in effect rewarding the student for his insight it seems that miss lenhart has taken the right course as it is shown later in 843 misconceptions that she wished her students to generally avoid any 803 airfoil at  wikipedia the title text also mentions that this is a common misconception and it is actually the first mentioned on list of common physics misconceptions on wikipedia in the wrong panel miss lenhart out of apparent embarrassment avoids the question entirely saying simply that it's complicated and implying that such questions are outside the student's understanding this way to continue a discussion where you wish to be right was much later used in 1731 wrong in the very wrong panel not only does miss lenhart avoid answering the question she attempts to distract them or even punish them for asking such an insightful question note that in this panel miss lenhart has clenched her fists suggesting anger by telling the kids that santa claus isn't real but in fact that he is really their parents xe2x80x94 something that would obviously distress children if they still believe in santa claus in addition to distracting them from the question they've asked and constitute harsh punishment for pointing out the teacher's ignorance of course most children old enough to be taught about the airflow around plane wings should be too old to believe in santa however if she just wished to tell them a bit about planes she may have drawn this drawing even in very early grades making the santa trick effective the title text suggests additional reasons for re thinking the common theory as to how airfoils create lift it points out that 1 it is absurd to believe the air has to get across the airfoil's two sides in the same amount of time and 2 the wright brothers plane's wings were curved the same amount on both sides of the airfoil which is not actually true; the wright flyer's wings were concave like an arch meaning that the distance that the air needs to travel to get across the wing is not the dispositive factor in creating lift the strip is correct in noting that lift is a far more complicated process than the simple theory posited by miss lenhart while the role of bernoulli's principle that is the difference in pressures cannot be entirely discounted the theory here is vastly too simple as an initial matter as suggested by the title text there is no reason that the air on top of the wing should be compelled to keep up with the air on the bottom of the wing indeed as demonstrated by the illustration below in the time that the air below the wing travels across the air on top of the wing has not only traveled the length of the entire top of the wing a distance that may be farther than the distance under the wing due to its shape but often additional distance  lift may be more usefully described as resulting from the deflection of air although this explanation still does not explain how symmetrical wings will work at least absent effects caused by a change in the angle of attack nor how a plane may fly upside down the wikipedia article on lift provides a more detailed explanation it in fact gives an explanation as to these two issues it explains that with zero angle of attack a symmetrical wing will not generate lift though it is possible that other factors may generate other slight upward force such as updrafts the shape of the plane and the angle of the engine relative to the wings it also explains that an asymmetrical or cambered wing may adjust angle of attack to compensate and still generate lift finally to answer the question in the second panel in a general sense most planes can't fly upside down for an extended period of time while many aerobatic aircraft can sustain inverted flight with negative g forces some others can achieve an inverted attitude only momentarily and are experiencing positive g forces in fact almost any airplane can do a barrel roll or aileron roll given sufficient altitude a boeing 707 prototype once did this
