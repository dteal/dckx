n this is the fourth entry in the ongoing xkcd phone series and once again the comic plays with many standard tech buzzwords to create a phone that sounds impressive but would actually be very impractical from the top left going clockwise   18000 xcexbcah micro ampere hours nickel lithium iron battery non rechargeable phone battery capacity is measured in ampere hours which thanks to the magic of dimensional analysis is just an unusual way of denoting electric charge which equals 3600 coulombs usually the capacity is quoted in milliampere hours one thousandth or 10 3 of an ampere hour; however this one is quoted in microampere hours one millionth or 10 6 of an ampere hour presumably as a marketing ploy to give a more impressive looking number quoted in more standard terms this phone's battery capacity is 18 mah in comparison an iphone 6+ has a battery capacity of 2750 mah  this phone's battery is dreadful under a typical current draw of 01a it would power the phone for about 11 minutes there is nothing normally called a nickel lithium iron battery rather this seems to be a malamanteau of the experimental nickelxe2x80x93lithium battery and the common lithium ion battery which does not contain any iron or the lithium iron phosphate battery often called lithium iron but more often called the lifepo battery the nickelxe2x80x93iron battery may contain lithium hydroxide but it's terrible for most applications worse this battery is non rechargeable meaning that it would have to be replaced to use the phone again after it is exhausted every 11 minutes at that  xkcd phone 3 was powered by two aa batteries not included which have an energy capacity roughly 100 times larger  many devices have a small second battery which is only used for keeping the clock time  this could be such a battery   subwoofer a subwoofer is a large bass speaker which this is not some phones do have high quality speakers for playing music but these are not placed right next to the earpiece this would be a surefire way to deafen your users when put next to dog whistle this is probably a pun since both relate to dogs; the sound a dog makes at least in english is woof  dog whistle a dog whistle is a high pitched whistle that humans cannot hear but dogs can  in speaker terminology a bass speaker is called a woofer because it could reproduce the low pitch of a dog bark  a treble speaker is a tweeter; if this whistle is actually a speaker it might be termed a supertweeter the scare quotes may be a reference to dog whistle politics in which certain phrases have a particular meaning to a segment of the audience that passes unnoticed by the rest this allows a candidate to surreptitiously signal agreement with that group without alienating the rest of the audience among whom the ideas might be unpopular if plainly stated  xkcd phone 2 contained a dog noticer   non porous washable on the one hand it's rare for a phone to be made of porous materials on the other there are legitimately waterproof phones that seal the speakers and ports with rubber  xkcd phone 2 was also washable though only once   webmd partnership cough activated feature reads aloud a random diagnosis for coughing webmd is a website to help people diagnose themselves for the vast majority of people a cough just means an irritated throat or maybe a cold but selecting randomly from all webmd diagnoses gives some much more ominous if very unlikely ones including ricin poisoning plague lung cancer and radiation poisoning  wings these wings resemble the ones found on sanitary towels sometimes called pads making this a possible ipad pun which attach the pad to the gusset and keep it in place between the woman's legs during her period menstruation cycle  if actually functional as aerodynamic wings they would likely come into play when the spacex impact protection feature becomes engaged and would likely make holding the phone awkward if rigid  xkcd phone 3 had a similarly positioned wristband   beveled bezel the bezel is the  ring around the edge of watches and screens this one's beveled which means it's cut at an angle  bezeled bevel punning on the above doesn't make much sense but could mean that it features a beveled edge which is surrounded by a bezel  seedless fruit such as grapes can be seedless which means that they're grown from a special cultivar that doesn't grow seeds in the normal way making a phone seedless probably won't do anything but it might hurt its random number generator  xkcd phone 3 was boneless   water resistant down to 30 meters and below 50 water resistance is often measured in terms of how deep an object can be submerged since pressure increases with depth in this case the phone can be submerged to almost any depth but there's an odd lacuna between 30 meters and 50 meters it also plays with the confusion in describing depths greater than 50m as below 50  alternatively this might indicate the phone must remain dry above 50 meters altitude  xkcd phone and xkcd phone 3 could drown  the latter was otherwise waterproof  xkcd phone 2 was only waterproof internally  in a previous comic 870 advertising a similarly absurd range was used up to 15% or more  this could be mocking the donut hole in american medicare drugs insurance where people are insured up to a certain amount then not insured then insured again  this doesn't appear to make sense to anyone   turing complete a computer is turing complete if it can perform all the operations needed to simulate a turing machine all modern computers are usually described as turing complete which would make this not very impressive but no computer can ever be turing complete in the truest sense since they can only ever have a finite amount of memory if the xkcd phone 4 is truly a universal computer it's very impressive indeed  gregorian/julian calendar date switch the julian calendar is the predecessor to the modern gregorian calendar the difference is that the two calendars calculate leap years differently the current difference between the calenders is 13 days which will remain unchanged until february 2100 the julian calendar is still used occasionally  mainly by eastern orthodox christians  but it's not something so vital that it needs a hardwired switch on the front of the phone  spacex impact protection when dropped phone lands on barge the rocket company spacex recently trialed a reusable rocket stage which after separating from the launch vehicle lands on a drone barge to be reused  the title text pokes fun at the number of spacex rockets that crashed and exploded before they got the landing gear right  parallel port a parallel port is a type of interface which transfers high volume simultaneous data  it was often used to connect printers and other devices to computers but was generally considered obsolete by the time smartphones began to appear on the market and would be very bulky and slow compared to the usb ports generally used in phones  it was commonly found together with serial ports which are used for low volume sequential data such as mouse movements  here it is paired with a serial interface for analog data with parallel outputs for several people  12 headphone jacks phones often include a single headphone jack to allow the user to privately listen to a call play music etc twelve of them would be pointless overkill especially given the difficulty of getting twelve people close enough to all use their headphones presumably joking about the constant rumours that apple's next iphone will not have any headphone jacks and the weird vents on the bottom of the phone it could also be a reference to one of the more talked about modules for the upcoming project ara phone from google which gives 4 headphone jacks not only allowing sharing between four people but would also allow full surround sound recording/playback at any location something often limited to recording studios  onboard cloud the cloud is a catch all term for the use of remote computers to store data providing a backup if all local copies are lost and allowing the data to be accessed from a broad network an onboard cloud would thus be a contradiction in terms and appears to be a marketing ploy to use the cloud buzzword to describe the device's onboard storage capacity  new brightglotm display incorporates genetically spliced jellyfish protein should have used the glowing genes not the stinging ones aequorea victoria jellyfish contain a protein called green fluorescent protein the gene for which has been isolated and can be used in many ways unfortunately the developers of this phone took the wrong gene and ended up getting one of the hundreds of proteins from jellyfish venom which will presumably mean that touching the screen becomes a painful experience  xe2x9cx93 certified twitter certifies accounts related to music producers government journalism business sports and other more official types of accounts with a blue checkmark besides the twitter handle besides the @whomever it's of course nonsense for a phone to be twitter verified alternatively it might be a reference to 1096 clinically studied ingredient in which buzzwords such as tested and certified are intended to make a given product sound more legitimate  software defined software defined radios are quite popular in some areas meaning the radio hardware is quite universal and can be adapted to different radio protocols just by  changing software sdr would actually be quite a nice feature for a cellphone of course it doesn't specify if it's the radio that is software defined  exposed ductwork a phone shouldn't even have ductwork unless it has a very sophisticated cooling system but this could supply air to the dog whistle exposed ductwork is a trademark of bowellist architecture such as the lloyd's building in london and the pompidou centre in paris exposed ductwork is also considered a crucial flaw in a death star may also refer to a transparent window in the side of the phone allowing the user to see the circuitry inside similar to computer cases with transparent side panels popular among diy computing enthusiasts  voice interaction siri cortana google now and alexa respond simultaneously these are all intelligent personal assistant software from apple microsoft google and amazon respectively and all do the same thing control your phone and answer questions using speech recognition having all four talk at once would mean you'd have a total cacophony while gaining nothing  xkcd phone 3 might have included siri    did you know 4 is iv in roman numeralsxc2xaexc2xa9xe2x84xa2 the tenth version of apple's operating system for its macintosh computer was labeled os x which was intended to be read as oh ess ten  steve jobs was irritated that everyone else preferred oh ess ecks  this phrase is labeled with trademark and copyright symbols as if someone desires it to be the product's tagline but has poor understanding of relevant laws  in particular xe2x84xa2 is a symbol for unregistered trademarks while xc2xae is a symbol for registered trademarks  if the phrase were an unregistered trademark the owner would be prohibited from using xc2xae
