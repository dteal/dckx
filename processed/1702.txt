n bug bites such as mosquito bites are itchy home remedies are often ineffective and in some cases very complicated  think of the number of suggestions on how to cure hiccups in this case cueball's suggestion starts out plausible but rapidly gets increasingly and insanely complicated involving finding rare french orchids megan is not actually interested in trying out a complex home remedy she really just wants sympathy the suggested remedy is a mix of many popular home remedies such as&#160;   taking a hot shower supposed to stimulate nerve endings it can also destroy some toxins  applying vinegar supposedly effective on mosquito bites  applying ice numbs the pain more commonly used on bruises  using aspirin as an anti inflammatory drug aspirin may have an effect on itches although it may cause more itches than provide relief  tea and a rare french orchid orchids like many other plants are commonly used in traditional medicine to cure various ailments and tea is a common route of administration  megan's answer is a sarcastic comment stating that her own family home remedy is to keep scratching until the skin falls off  which is a natural tendency although not until the skin literally falls off; hence it is not really a home remedy just a natural reaction the title text refers to chiggers or trombicula alfreddugesi as the worst source for itches; in fact only in the larval stages are these mites parasitic chigger can also refer to the chigoe flea or jigger tunga penetrans a parasitic flea which also causes bad itching but randall explicitly mentions the mite trombicula alfreddugesi a move to a more northerly region of the world like iceland might seem to be a perfect cure because those parasites are only found in warmer southern regions similarly since mosquitoes lay their eggs in water moving to a dry place with no water usable by mosquitoes would be a cure for mosquito bites  unusually iceland does not support native mosquitoes despite similarities to other northern regions which do one might fallaciously assume it does not support parasites in general &#8212; but it does support parasitic insects in other genera and it has other species of mites  thus move to iceland is a weird home remedy that will work if the person wants to prevent chiggers however it won't work if the person wants to stay away from all parasites this comic could be seen as a continuation of the title text from 1693 oxidation where that is interpreted as ponytail ineffectively reassuring megan that her bug bites should not be a concern
