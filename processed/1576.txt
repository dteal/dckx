n this comic references the dichotomy between the literal meaning of the phrase i could care less and its idiomatic meaning in american english as an expression of indifference synonymous with i couldn't care less many people argue that this use is incorrect and the phrase should only be i couldn't care less which is the original form of the expression and remains the standard form in british english this is the opinion expressed for example by the weird al yankovic song word crimes like i could care less  that means you do care at least a little however linguists point out that the strict application of logic to an idiom is inappropriate many expressions seem on the surface to mean the opposite of the meaning they are used to convey eg head over heels and they defend i could care less on those grounds the psychologist steven pinker argues in the language instinct that the phrase is sarcastic cf big deal while linguist john lawler explains it as a negative polarity item a phrase that is practically only used in negated form allowing the explicit negation to be omitted a pattern often found in french in this comic megan feels alone because there is unavoidable difference between her understanding of her own words and the listener's interpretation so while she sees discussion of semantics as being of potentially high social and emotional value she doesn't think it has objective value however ironically at the end of the comic the meaning of i could care less with regards to ponytail's behavior is ambiguous either megan is brushing off ponytail's pedantry because she doesn't care about it she couldn't care less or she is hurt by ponytail's focus on the details of her words rather than the emotional cues she should have learned over the course of their relationship she actually could care less the title text refers to another word often used in ways some consider incorrect literally see 725 literally the sentence is also ambiguous as it may mean that 'literally' or 'figuratively' the speaker could or couldn't care less further it implies that randall considers the argument over whether literally may be properly used to mean 'figuratively' is petty in the same way later in 1735 fashion police and grammar police ponytail is once again on the side of the grammar police and also in this comic the word literally is used alternatively it could mean that megan cares too much about ponytail's correction considering her response to it in a further alternative the title text could amount to a self ironical evaluation on randallxe2x80x99s part to the effect that he himself might be devoting too much of his time and energy to the meaning of the phrase in question as evidenced by the comic itself the inverse image of megan floating through space in the fourth panel as well as her long introspection is a reference to the five part choices series starting at 264 choices part 1
