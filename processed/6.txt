n it must be part of the human condition that causes us to think that odd statements are sometimes more humorous than those supposed to be funny cueball makes a true statement that his statement is not very funny however because he invoked irony and thus makes it self referential the sentence is now funny the other guy also a cueball like character producing a fake laugh is probably not so sure that it is actually funny now going meta in 20000 years there might be no more humans on earth to find the irony funny any more how ironic alternatively the barren landscape would have occurred regardless of whether someone made the joke so ironically the cautionary tale is completely meaningless although still funny   this is the first xkcd comic showing stick figure people which eventually becomes a defining characteristic of the future comic series it is thus also the first comic with cueball and the first with multiple cueballs  the too much perspective idea may reference the total perspective vortex in the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy   self references was already used again in 33 self reference and again and again but never more famously than in 688 self description
