n randall presents a venn diagram or a logical diagram that illustrates the relationship between multiple sets the diagram is usually used when sets overlap in other words a venn diagram of even numbers and numbers divisible by 5 would have 2 4 6 8 12xe2x80xa6 in one circle 5 15 25xe2x80xa6 in another circle and 10 20 30xe2x80xa6 in the intersection of the circles as those numbers fit into both sets here we have a three set diagram which randall has purportedly created to explain his feelings to his love interest the three sets are 1 people who can always make him smile; 2 people he wants to spend the rest of his life with and 3 people who constantly show him new things to love about the world in the intersection of these three sets is you xe2x80x93 his love interest all three of those statements apply to her normally this might be a cute way of simply implying that he has these three feelings about her without including any other elements in any of the sets however here randall has included one other element vanilla ice an early 1990s rapper is shown to also constantly show randall new things to love about the world and is also someone randall wants to spend the rest of his life with although vanilla ice doesn't always make him smile vanilla ice is a caucasian read white rapper who was most popular in the early 1990s with his song ice ice baby he was frequently mocked as a very white rapper he is obviously an unexpected name to turn up in this diagram apparently randall's love interest didn't take too well to randall professing similar feelings for vanilla ice as he did for her causing some friction in their relationship the title text suggests that other 90s rappers have similarly affected randall's past relationships
