n cueball is gathering a lot of different sorts of random things including a parasol a miniature eiffel tower what appears to be a small round bomb with a short fuse and the bust of a mannequin he adds these to an already immense pile of weird things including balloons and a cage with a bird  while this happens cueball narrates in short sentences the first three are statements that at first seems similar to what you would find on a birthday or anniversary card from one person in a relationship to another but in this case all the statements ends up being negative or at least neutral   normal sentence you are the light of my life  cueballs sentence you are not the light of my life  normal sentence  making you happy is my greatest dream  cueballs sentence making you happy isn't my greatest dream  normal sentence your smile is all i live for  cueballs sentence  your smile is not all i live for   the negative continues in the fourth statement but then it turns around and ends up kind of positive   negative fourth sentence i've got my own stuff going on  positive fifth sentence but you're strange and fascinating and i've never met anyone like you   it turns out to be megan he is talking about who is shown applying a hammer to the front of a large and strange vehicle while standing one of it's huge wheels she seems to have build this giant super tank/machine from anything cueball supplies her with with several huge pigged wheels a mounted gun satellite dish a crane and smoke coming out of an exhaust pipe at the top implying it is already running it seems quite a disturbing tank she is creating but cueball is very fascinated by her strangeness cueball's final statement is also positive i want to give you everything hence the title which could have been on a card as it is but the reason is unusual and written at the bottom right at the very end as his final statement the reason he wishes to give her everything is because what she does is so strange and fascinating so he does this just to see what you would do with it referring to whatever it is megan is building now or later some of the objects in the piles in the second panel can easily be determined like the two balloons but most others are more difficult to recognize to the left there is what appears to be a cage with an animal inside could be a bird to the right there appears to be the hilt of a sword maybe stuck in a stone see 1521 sword in the stone finally the tall thin thing sticking out of the top left of the right pile could be the stuffed giraffe from 604 qwertial aphasia there are other distinct things like the tall cylinder and the three cannonballs in a pyramid pile to the left and something with a peculiar shape between the giraffe and the sword hilt but it seems impossible to determine what they are the title text similarly starts with the conventional beatles love song i want to hold your hand but for an unconventional reason to not fall out of a gyrocopter a gyrocopter is a flying machine that has a rotor like a helicopter but the rotor is not powered by a motor rather the motor of the gyrocopter drives a propeller that accelerates the machine forward while the air rushing past the rotor drives the rotor like a helicopter during autorotation
