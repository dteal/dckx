n this comic is an affectionate parody of calvin and hobbes a newspaper comic drawn by bill watterson that ran for ten years from november 1985 to december 1995 calvin and hobbes follows the daily life of a rambunctious precocious six year old named calvin and his sarcastic stuffed tiger hobbes sunday strips for both calvin and hobbes and many other print comics often consisted of two comics strung together the first one often lasting one or two panels and the second one being more elaborate this comic follows the sunday strip pattern hence the double comic in the title the artwork in the second strip is distinctly wattersonian as well calvin and hobbes is also referenced in 529 sledding discussion randall has a special fascination with motorized skateboards a longboard is a skateboard that is longer and is used for downhill races and skating through less urban areas college campuses for example mario kart is a game for nintendo game consoles that allows four players to race each other while having good spirited fun like at 290 fucking blue shells while throwing items at each other the objects in the fourth panel are koopa troopa shells items in the game they can be thrown like projectiles to crash into foes calvin and hobbes frequently involves heavy philosophical discussions in one recurring theme they ride down a dangerous hill in a red wagon or tobbogan while discussing the nature of morality usually ending in a crash examples 1 2 3 this comic inverts that by having cueball and megan go uphill while discussing philosophy naturally they collide with calvin and hobbes' wagon which prompts the title text cueball uses the c and python programming languages as analogies for their ride in general python is easier than c and abstracts a lot of c's hairier features boring parts as randall calls them moving from c to python is quite a freeing experience; programmers no longer have to worry about pointers and memory allocation and just lets the code flow through the programmer until they are one with the force erm computer although it seems before the crash that the idea that programming in c and skating without electricity builds character is about to be explored philosophically building character is also a recurring theme in calvin and hobbes as documented delightfully in the calvin and hobbes wiki electric skateboards have been the subject of several other comics like 139 i have owned two electric skateboards a panel in 442 xkcd loves the discovery channel and the entire the race five part comic series
