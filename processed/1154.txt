n this new year comic is a little reminder that it's the last day of 2012 and it's time to make your new year's resolutions cueball wants to break a very common habit of resolving to do something go on a diet for example not doing it and then trying the same dysfunctional plan again thinking it will work this year this is another way of stating a common folk definition of insanity to keep doing what you always do yet expecting different results the irony is that cueball resolved the same thing last year and it is implied it didn't work but he says it'll be different this year the title text is a parody of the saying if at first you don't succeed try try try again
