n this comic which appeared the day before national train day plays on the fact that a choice of a reference frame is arbitrary leading to the principle of relativity in albert einstein's theories of special relativity and general relativity but at speeds much lower than the speed of light it also applies to the newtonian mechanics rather than viewing this situation as a train causing itself to move relative to an immobile earth randall provides the unconventional perspective of a train remaining fixed in space while causing the earth itself and all the stars in the sky to rotate instead in principle either perspective is equally valid xe2x80x94 though in practice different trains often move in mutually exclusive directions thus each train would have to define its own frame of reference it is said that einstein once asked a ticket collector what time does oxford stop at this train changing the reference frame into the inside of the train only means that you see the outside world in a different reference since the train doesn't really move the earth the train's engine and the friction of the wheels aren't even remotely powerful enough it simply appears that way from the inside from the newtonian perspective this choice of frame is valid but results in unnecessarily complicated math; the equation of motion would include terms for centrifugal coriolis and other so called fictional forces see 123 centrifugal force newton supposes the existence of inertial frames in which these forces are zero and the surface of the earth approximates an inertial frame well in general relativity the presence of mass in a system curves the spacetime around of it the train earth system could be modelled in general relativity taking the train as fixed however the resulting equations would be complex and not amenable to an exact solution the title text expands on this to include elevators which change a person's position relative to the center of the earth from a passenger's perspective it would appear as though the earth's position was instead being changed in space these examples use the train and the elevator as fixed points to define relative travel the more common method to define movement is to use the earth's surface as fixed point but other reference points could be the earth's center the sun predefined fixed stars or the center of our galaxy each of these would result in a completely different movement speed  the speed of the train stationary on the equator relative to the earth's center 465&#160;m/s 1674&#160;km/h or 1040&#160;mph the speed of the train on earth relative to the sun 30&#160;km/s 108000&#160;km/h or 67000&#160;mph the speed of the train on earth relative the center of our galaxy 220&#160;km/s 828000&#160;km/h or 514000&#160;mph  the train as seen from an inertial frame doesn't seem to rotate the earth but it does in fact have a minute immeasurable effect on the earth's rotation see what if 41 go west and 162 angular momentum
