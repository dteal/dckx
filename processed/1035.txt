n cadbury eggs are a chocolate egg shaped candy with a filling they are supposed to replicate a real egg with a hard exterior and soft interior however unlike real eggs the exterior is edible in this comic cueball is trying to say that sodas have way too much sugar to even be appealing as beverages because they contain as much sugar as 2 or 3 cadbury eggs and one cadbury egg alone makes him feel sick however megan interprets this in precisely the opposite way to what cueball intended instead of comparing soda to cadbury eggs she compares cadbury eggs to soda if a few cadbury eggs have the same amount of sugar as soda megan can eat as many as she wants year round in place of soda with no additional guilt cadbury eggs are usually consumed around easter xe2x80x94 which is usually anywhere from late march to late april the title text mentions the closure of the manufacture in new zealand in 2009 and the change of the filling from runny to thick as a consequence the joke here is the comparison to real eggs who can be cooked scrambled the new thick filling is not liquid enough to be cooked in a pan as was the old runny filling
