n when asked by megan what he's been up to cueball responds with the warning tv tropes link suspiciously specific denial definitely not spending every day consumed with worry over stupid things i never talk to anyone about which suggests that that is exactly what he's been spending every day doing but he is hiding it from her and everyone else megan's response oh yeah me neither suggests she too is worrying over stupid things but isn't admitting it instead of discussing their mutual worry and possibly making each other feel better they instead continue to not talk to anyone about it and stand in awkward silence the title text continues the irony suggesting it's good that they're too smart to spend all day being uselessly frustrated with themselves but that's apparently exactly what they are doing this could also be a reference to the common response to the question megan asks in the first panel nothing a response that is almost certainly false and usually means the same thing that cueball said but is usually accepted if not expected
