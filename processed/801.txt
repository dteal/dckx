n java is a programming language touted for its portabilityxe2x84xa2 which sometimes leads to it being used in systems where it really just shouldn't be used cueball laments that the hardware he's tinkering with despite being used for a single purpose has its firmware written in java; since the microprocessor is unknown it's quite possible the java virtual machine jvm had to be ported over to the processor before the hardware designers could write firmware for it presumably they considered this worthwhile to be able to write the control code in a language they're comfortable with even though it probably would have been much simpler to just write the control code in whatever language they used to port the jvm in the first place black hat explains that this is really an example of an age old adage when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail also referred to as the law of the instrument or as in the title the golden hammer the hardware developers probably only knew java and when they thought about how to write firmware for their new device java was the only solution that occurred to them of course instead of a hammer and a nail black hat's analogy is about using bolt cutters and vodka to get through the lock on wolf blitzer's boathouse not so coincidentally black hat is holding a pair of bolt cutters and a bottle of vodka the implication is that black hat did in fact break into wolf blitzer's boathouse the previous night which is why he has just now entered the door at the start of the strip the changes he makes to the adage implies that he believes vodka and boltcutters are designed specifically to be used on wolf blitzer's boathouse an interpretation that fits black hat's warped and anarchic disposition the title text implies that black hat had to break into a number of boathouses before he found wolf's and that his boat did not survive the evening  the use of the phrase 'our night' allows us to infer that black hat may have been with danish his partner in crime
