n spider man is a fictional superhero in comic books published by marvel comics and has been the star of a number of television shows and film the spider man theme song first used for the 1967 cartoon show includes the words spider man spider man does whatever a spider can however at other points the theme song explains some things spider man can do that a real spider obviously couldn't such as crime fighting randall is pointing out that while the abilities attributed to spider man make a good superhero story spider men #3 they are not real abilities of a spider this comic depicts cueball as a far more realistic spider man behaving and thinking much more closely to a real spider than the spider man from the comics cueball is shown ballooning1 a trait used by spiders to move between locations rather than swinging on web cords as in the comics and films as he is floating he sees a good spot to land eat some bugs and make an egg sac again this contrasts the real life of a spider with spider man who would doubtless be rushing to fight crime or save a pretty girl only female spiders create an egg sac male spiders spin a sperm web in order to transfer their sperm from their epigastric furrow into their pedipalps reproductive organ located on the front two appendages in the position where a scorpion would have pincers which will then be used to transfer the sperm into the female during copulation cueball/spider man being nominally male should in fact be looking for a place to create a sperm web not an egg sac however thanks to being featured in children's books the actions of female spiders are much more widely known the title text refers to the mating ritual of some spiders in which the male performs a dance to court the female mary jane is the third love interest and peter's eventual wife in the spider man stories and so cueball is planning to court her by dancing in front of her in doing so he hopes that he is lucky and she doesn't eat him before copulating with him as sexual cannibalism is a trait associated with spiders
