n cueball is a knight that has saved a kingdom it seems that he is being rewarded by a god since his reward is inside a box that is floating in a beam of heavenly light inside the box is a pair of shoes with five toes and with these magic shoes he can outrun death this comic refers to a new type of running shoes that have very little support and have individual areas for each toe they are supposed to make you feel like running barefoot specifically the shoes cueball takes out of the box looks like vibram fivefingers  the joke in the comic is that the shoes are so strange/creepy that cueball is not even sure he would want to live forever if he would have to wear these shoes at all times immortality is not worth it the title text is a play on the common phrase x is the best thing since sliced bread the way that randall uses the phrase in the title text humorously implies that these shoes would be almost as good to wear on your feet as two slices of bread earlier in 977 map projections it was stated that those who preferred the dymaxion projection would wear shoes with toes and later in 1735 fashion police and grammar police it was a different type of shoes that was deemed non fashionable with the crocs
