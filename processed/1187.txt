n aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of the image and in this case a video and is denoted in a ratio of &lt;width&gt;&lt;height&gt; usually either in lowest common denominator or with a decimal width to a height of 1 up until the 1990s all televisions and most computer monitors crt tube and lcd were in the standard 43 aspect ratio called fullscreen meaning the width is 4/3 or 133 times the height when hdtv was developed the standard for television screens changed to 169 width being 16/9 or 177 times the height called widescreen although widescreen can also refer to a number of even wider ratios used in feature films computer monitors are now available in widescreen ratios though fullscreen remains common as well letterboxing is a process whereby an image which does not fully fill a screen is expanded to fill the screen by the addition of further material mattes usually this is done with the addition of black bars in the empty space one example of why this was necessary was widescreen films on vhs cassette vhs could only record and play back 43 images thus in order to display a widescreen film the rest of the vhs's 43 image had to be filled with horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of the image those bars were part of the video information recorded on the cassette when dvds were introduced many dvds also had letterbox bars on the dvd's full screen image with the increased popularity of widescreen televisions dvd players were improved to offer anamorphic widescreen in which the full widescreen image is horizontally rescaled shrunk into a 43 size which the player then was able to display stretched horizontally back to the proper widescreen aspect with the advent of blu ray video is generally encoded in whatever its proper aspect ratio is intended to be and the player itself is left to appropriately matte the image the problem with letterboxed video such as a 169 video letterboxed for 43 is that if one tries to watch the video on a 169 widescreen where the image should fill the whole screen instead the 43 letterboxed image fills part of the screen with further vertical mattes on the left and right of the image thus producing an image much smaller than it needs to be with mattes on all four sides some tvs or media players can zoom to help resolve the issue although the video resolution usually suffers by encoding only the video itself and allowing the player to do the matting the video can be seen as large as possible on any given screen animorphs is a late 90's to early 00's young adult book series about shape shifting teens who turn into animals to fight body snatching aliens sony held the rights to create a film but never made use of them beyond creating urls for a proposed movie on december 11 2012 in this comic randall appears to be complaining about the issue of widescreen videos which have been rescaled to 43 by adding mattes to the top and bottom and uploaded on sites like youtube he is probably annoyed by the fact that on his widescreen monitor tv or mobile device the video as noted above does not fill the screen because of the letterboxing in some cases uploaders also take video and rescale it to the point where the image is improperly compressed horizontally or vertically even without letterboxing this is more akin to the car crushing randall depicts in the comic a note is that if someone managed to expand the car the car would not be un crushed and probably even weakened even more referencing the bigger damage done when letterboxed video is attempted to be expanded to its original ratio distorting the video quality
