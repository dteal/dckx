n this comic features cueball sitting down to a meal and requesting that an offscreen person pass him the salt the offscreen person osp then proceeds to solve the problemgenerally cueball's implied/specific request was can and will you pass me the salt immediately however the osp begins to solve the salt problem generally without regard for time context the specific heat of the meal or what some would call common sense for the next 20 minutes while cueball nibbles at his bland cooling meal the osp works on a system that will pass condiments more quickly than possible by the osp the problem obviously is that developing and then using the system is much slower than just manually passing the salt  in the title text randall states that when someone uses a lot of time to do an easy task right in the present he considers them a perfectionist with no ability to prioritize since they are unable to do something inefficiently even if it satisfies the task at hand much quicker yet if a perfectionist had done something right in the past he would be impressed and consider them a master artisan of great foresight the osp's argument for taking so much time is that in the end if he were to add up all the time he saved by no longer needing to pass condiments it will equal more time than it took to build the system and thus in the long term he will have saved time and solved the general problem of passing condiments this could also be spread out to many people all over the world and thus save a billion times as much time if a billion people in the world have both condiments and an adequate food supply to use them on this situation would be akin to a major website performing maintenance during peak hours instead of waiting till traffic was lower from the perspective of the person trying to check their email the upgrade would seem ill timed and unnecessary however if the person were to instead log in not till the following day he would think the upgrade was masterful and full of great insight put simply the comic draws attention to the fact that humans are very adept at things that can be difficult to teach machines we learn as children how to pass arbitrary things to someone who asks however to design a 'system' to do this can be quite difficult dealing with recognition shape size temperature etc there is an engineering joke here that novices often attempt to solve general systems problems that seem trivial at first sight but can end up taking years to solve the superficial joke is that a human would have to think at all to do this let alone 20 minutes the title text carries perhaps the more important point for which of course this case is a trivial and hence humorous example most pure and some applied research does not look like it is a reasonable use of one's time therefore only in retrospect when something has in fact resulted in a generally recognized useful product can one justify the time and resources consumed until then it looks like self indulgence   see also 137 dreams 1205 is it worth the time1319 automation and the time management category
