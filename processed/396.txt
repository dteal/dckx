n the ring is a horror movie released in 2002 based off the japanese movie ringu in it there is a video tape that causes everyone who watches it to die after seven days however the viewer can prevent their death by making a copy of the tape and giving it to someone else a young boy cueball watches the tape and prevents his own death by copying the tape and uploading it to a video sharing website presumably youtube cueball not only got one person to watch it the requirement for escaping death but 363104 people; all of whom are most likely going to die in seven days rickrolling1 is an internet meme where someone is lured into clicking on a video link of rick astley singing never gonna give you up when someone is rickrolled they usually get very upset cueball states in the comic that he uploaded the tape to get revenge on everyone who rickrolled him though it was obvious that he would likely kill many more people than those who rickrolled him or those who've rickrolled anyone else the title text refers to the file format used by the youtube player historically youtube was famous for having extremely poor quality videos because their internet connections were slower and server storage space was expensive so all videos were transcoded into a very low quality flv flash video format the girl shown in the video tape xe2x80x94 a major part of the ring series xe2x80x94 is named samara posting the tape on youtube would result in heavily compressed videos in the flv format this presumably would reduce the quality of samara's apparition the title text also implies that nobody deserves that although rickrolling is apparently punishable by death
