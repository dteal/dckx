n another comic where randall takes a less than serious look at sports the halftime pep talk of a basketball game is commonly used by coaches to inspire his team to come back from a seemingly insurmountable deficit and to make strategic changes that will help them do so unfortunately the basketball coach cueball has absolutely no fundamental understanding of the sport and has pulled his team of cueball like players into the locker room while the game is still in progress enabling the other team to score at will  he could have tried to get a time out but still he would not have been allowed to take his team down to the locker room the title text parodies a common plot of especially us sports movies in which an inexperienced team and sometimes coach still manage to win a title after a highly motivational pep talk see for instance hoosiers in this case the players are not even just poor basketball players but rather chess players and the coach know nothing of the sport the opposite of what is usually the case in said movies and of course in this case those pessimistic about their chances were proved right in 1392 dominant players randall compares basketball with chess
