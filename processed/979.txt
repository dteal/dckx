n this comic refers to a common experience that those trying to solve tech problems have typically people search on google to try to find solutions to the problem sometimes the solution can be found on a software program's website but the most helpful solutions frequently come from discussions on message boards particularly for more obscure problems this is because the odds are rather high that someone else years ago had the same problem you're having and resolved it however in this comic cueball is unable to find any mention of the problem he's currently facing except for one forum post about it that did not include the problem's solution this is akin to finding an faq with questions but no answers the title is a satirical reference to the notion that the ancients ie from thousands of years ago possessed knowledge that has been lost to the centuries such as exactly how stonehenge was built and that artifacts from those times do not fully divulge such knowledge the fact that the ancient referred to in the comic is from 2003 only 8 years before the comic was published is an exaggeration of the feeling that the forum poster is lost to the sands of time but in some sense this feeling is nonetheless true since cueball is unlikely to be able to contact her or him  the title text is a suggestion to forums to be aware of the fact that people are likely going to come across such posts in the future and therefore to provide handy summaries of the most helpful conclusions of long threads for them since combing through several false starts and failed attempts to resolve a problem can be quite tedious in 1722 debugging the title text also mentions googling an error message explaining what it means if you get zero results
