n in the comic cueball has gotten a gps and asks megan what to do with it she suggest that they take their current coordinates and modify the latitude and longitude with a simple function based on their birthdays thereby pointing to an arbitrary non random location for example if cueball was born on let's say april 1 1986 and megan on august 12 1988 and they are somewhere in new york 40768062 7398468 the coordinate they type could make 4004018673081288 assuming us date format or 4086040173880812 assuming following iso 8601 the good thing about keeping the number before the decimal point is that the distance is still realistic to get to by car megan suggests to make out in this place this procedure is somewhat of a precursor to geohashing the comic is a christmas comic since it came online on christmas day 2006 the title text suggests if the location you make for yourselves is over water which the example above happens to be you either need to find a boat or find some rule that you can preserve the promise of making out and if you can't do either then there is no way you'd get to make out
