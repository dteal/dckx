n the diagram is a graphical representation of the statistically predicted distribution of nearby exoplanets planets not in our solar system based on the assumption that the exoplanets that are currently known have a distribution of orbits sizes and star types that is similar to the actual distribution astronomers are particularly interested in exoplanets within 60 light years of earth which lie in a habitable zone; that is a planet whose orbit is within a certain range of distance from a star such that water could exist in a liquid state since almost all life on earth which is the only place we've actually found life thus far depends on liquid water in some way these planets are considered the most likely to support life the diagram categorizes exoplanets in two ways the disc color indicates the characteristics of the central star with a
