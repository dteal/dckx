n a reference to the most well known sonnet in the english speaking world william shakespeare's sonnet 18 the first line of which is shall i compare thee to a summer's day in this comic randall sets about this in a typically goal oriented chart as opposed to the rather more romantic poetry of the bard   the lines are 1 the first line is a reference to the sonnet itself which reads thou art more lovely and more temperate  he considers both thee and a summer's day to be fair this is a pun; depending on context fair can refer to complexion or weather and temperate meaning warm which again can describe a person or the weather 2 hot sticky also refers to both in different ways  hot can mean sexually attractive or simply that the temperature is high  a sticky day refers to humidity 3 short is another pun  thee is not tall  a summer day is chronologically long time from dawn to dusk 4 harbinger of hurricane season is technically accurate; hurricane season does follow the summer 5 required for a good beach party is not a pun although it is another example of a word with slightly different meanings  the party is required to be held on summer's day and with thee present at the party  the party would not be held on thee although some of the other lines suggest that the writer might personally be on top of thee during the party 6 heat stroke is a condition mainly affecting children and the elderly heat waves and excessively hot days are highly linked with heat stroke incidence; see epidemiology 7 linked to higher rates of juvenile delinquency apparently refers juveniles committing crimes in the summer  however this results to some degree from school not being in session rather than simply as a direct result of the summer weather 8 sometimes too stifling is another pun  it is also unusual in that it expresses a negative feeling about thee unlike the other entries which express what the author likes or admires about thee 9 arrested for releasing snakes in the library is possibly inspired by the movie snakes on a plane 10 the last line difficult to focus on work while i'm in is a sexual reference on the thee side not on the summer's day side  to be in someone refers to the penetrative part of sex which would occupy a typical person's attention in shakespeare's day english had informal pronouns and formal pronouns thou/thee informal and ye/you formal this is similar to what is still used today in many european languages wikipedia has a nice chart for all of english's personal pronouns current and archaic for both the chart and the original sonnet whether or not the work is autobiographical is unknown  also unknown is the identity of the person whom each work refers to  it is believed that sonnet 18 is addressed to a young man and of course the title text is a reference to ron paul a former republican candidate for president who was on top in the republican primary against a few other challengers for the nomination ron paul was frequently represented on the internet using similar language to the image text paul has been seen as an alternative because he is a strict libertarian and believes the government should be as small as possible and stay out of people's lives
