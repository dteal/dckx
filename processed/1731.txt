n       this explanation may be incomplete or incorrect more on white hat's new theory from the last panel the abstraction of the particle idea not explainedif you can address this issue please edit the page thanks  all objects on earth are matter meaning they are made of atoms which are specifically not made up of antimatter atoms while once when they were named believed to be the smallest unit of matter are now known to be made up of protons neutrons and electrons protons and neutrons are in turn made up of quarks quarks come in six different flavors up down top bottom charm and strange with protons and neutrons being made of the first two types each flavour also has a corresponding flavour of the quark's antiparticle an antiquark which would make up antiprotons and antineutrons white hat and megan appear to be discussing the topics of antimatter and subatomic particles white hat makes the assertion that we referring to people and objects are made partially of antimatter because as he claims a proton one of the particles which makes up all matter is made of two quarks and an antiquark in fact protons are made up of two up quarks and a down quark he is making the simple mistake of mixing up the difference between up and down flavors of quarks which in some ways are opposite flavours of quarks with the difference between particles and antiparticles he continues to elaborate on his idea by mentioning neutrons which are made of two down quarks and an up quark which he incorrectly reasons as two antiquarks and a quark white hat may have incorrectly remembered that while the valence quarks in a proton are all matter quantum field theory says that protons also contain an indefinite number of virtual anti quarks quarks and gluons see this video what are quarks about this  his final comment could be referring to the ontological debate over whether virtual particles are in some sense real or only an artifact of perturbation theory when megan accurately doubts his claim white hat takes out his smartphone to look it up in order to show megan that he is correct however upon researching online he realizes that he was in fact wrong hence the title of the comic not wanting to admit being incorrect or yield his position in the discussion he convinces himself that he wasn't actually wrong as depicted by his mentally erasing the realization that he was wrong instead he completely changes the topic to try and re frame it so that he is not wrong in this case he circles back and criticises the entire scientific concept of particles presumably he will go on to explain how scientists are wrong and how he remains correct that humans are made up in part of anti matter it is rather common to be unwilling to admit fault the whole topic of this comic and to instead try to maintain an air of infallibility and intelligence some people are just too prideful to admit that they are inherently fallible white hat is one of those people as depicted in several of his earlier appearances see trivia section randall uses this comic to criticize people who are unable to put aside their ego and re assess what they know in the face of empirical data such thinking flies directly against scientific rigor adding an extra layer of irony to the situation since white hat and megan are discussing a scientific topic this method had already been called wrong in 803 airfoil white hat's new topic where he can be right includes the quantum field theory a very complicated field which it is likely megan is not well versed in  inferred by the fact that she was not quite sure about the anti quarks so he may be raising the topic because he believes she will not understand it sufficiently to refute his correctness megan however recognizes exactly what he is trying to do and can only sigh in response to his failed efforts in qft particles are often described as resonances in the title text white hat just remembers another thing he's right about this shows that he is not interested in a discussion on the merits of a topic but instead is seeking only recognition and validation for being right this bears some similarity to 386 duty calls in which cueball stays up late correcting someone on the internet
