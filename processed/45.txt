n this comic is a joke creating a humorously false synthesis combining the principals of quantum superposition and the effects of reading a comic one panel at a time schrxc3xb6dinger's cat is a thought experiment that illuminates the notion that a particle only resolves itself to its state upon observation and until this observation it is in all of its possible states simultaneously in the thought experiment a cat is both dead and alive until observation likewise in this comic the comic is both funny and unfunny until the comic is observed or read black hat and cueball are likening the last panel to the box with the cat until you read it it is in a mixed state a superposition of both funny and unfunny in the last panel black hat says shit  the joke is that after reading the last panel the comic is both funny as it is unexpected and not funny as the last line was a non sequitur and therefore there is no climax at the same time thus proving black hat and cueball wrong hence them expressing discontent with the word shit the title text which randall here calls the alt text suggests that the alt text did not exist until the mouse over action occurred
