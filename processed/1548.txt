n this is another example where randall describes the inexorable passage of time the children are complaining about things their parents tell them as children are wont to do their first complaint is something recognizable the usual just eat your vegetables they're good for you the second is about a comment lol remember rugrats and doug share if you're a 90's kid which however is a generic social media comment that a 90's kid would make not something you would expect a mother to say at least not in the context of things their children are embarrassed about but it illustrates that the teens and tweens of yesteryear are now adults and parents at that according to the cia world factbook in the usa the median age of mothers at their first birth is 256 2011 estimate on the date this comic was published this would center the mother's own birth date in very late 1989 although there are various interpretations of the term 90's kid most center around the person in question having had most or all of their childhood during the 1990s the stereotypical '90s kid has a strong attachment to objects movies tv shows phrases etc from the era of their childhood which bring back memories of their younger days in this comic randall picks up on a number of things which could be used to identify a '90s kid  the use of the acronym lol means laughing out loud or laugh out loud and was probably coined in the 1980s finding its way into general usage with the later uptake of wider public internet and should be known to every kid working or playing on a computer today  rugrats is a cartoon that was produced from 1991 all the way to 2004 featuring the adventures of a group of toddlers and babies  doug is another cartoon that ran from 1991 to 2000  the use of traditional social media and more specifically of sharing the type of post described  given that the children shown in the comic appear to be somewhat older than newborn babies is not contradictory since a 90s kid is anyone who was a kid during the '90s so that would also include kids who turned five in 1990 or even ten; so today a 90s kid could easily be more than 30 years old and thus have children more than 10 years old the title text suggests that viewing a child of one's own peering through such a barrier elicits nostalgia for the rugrats cartoon a baby gate is a semi fixed piece of child safety equipment to restrict a small child typically a toddler from leaving a safe area of a house and especially to prevent access to stairways up or down where falls may happen without overly inconveniencing an adult who can open the gate baby gates fully enclosed playpens and similar barriers around cots feature as usually insurmountable barriers to the younger characters in rugrats who are of crawling and toddling age
