n this comic references one of the scenes from the sci fi classic star wars set in mos eisley cantina at the spaceport on tatooine a wretched hive of scum and villainy in this scene obi wan kenobi with the beard and luke skywalker on the left are trying to get off the planet secretly and they enlist help from han solo and chewbacca chewbacca is the very hairy one because he is a wookiee from the planet kashyyyk  han solo tels he is captain of the famous ship the millennium falcon when luke asks what that is he brags about it telling that it's the ship that made the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs which is crazy as parsec is a distance unit not a measure of time but it turns out that what luke asks about is what a falcon is etymology is the study of the history of words their origins and how their form and meaning have changed over time randall wonders what luke would say to han if he had no idea what a falcon was  normally the viewers of sci fi accept that the aliens speak standard english and do not wonder why they have a word like falcon because of the etymology of the word in our world but there is no evidence of a falcon in the star wars universe especially for luke who has been raised only on tatooine a desert world in the title text randall references the fact that star wars is set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away and muses over the fact that he as a child dit not have any problems dispensing his disbelief in a distant galaxy full of humans but was still derailed by the language it would seem unlikely that another galaxy has creatures to similar to humans while at the same time being filled with so many other types of creatures the reference to indo european roots is another reference to etymology as an example certain words will have indo european roots because the word originated in indo european languages and as there are nor asia or europe in star wars how come they use the english language
