n this comic is a satirical infographic which is usually used to simplify and help visualize information that would be dreadfully boring otherwise randall takes this simplification to the extreme by making an unhelpful infographic complete with unnecessary data and ironic and blatant misuse of common graphs and charts at this point he is not even simplifying his sentence by the year 2019 all information will be communicated in this clear and concise format he makes a sarcastic claim pointing out how needlessly complicated some infographics make things they are supposed to condense in the chart  the number 2019 is huge and placed between the numbers 2018 and 2020 which is bordering on extraneous considering that the fact that 2019 precedes 2020 and succeeds 2018 is blindingly obvious the graph of information represented by this format is extrapolated off of and intersects with 100% at 2019 this is a running joke on xkcd and is ridiculous for multiple reasons as shown in 605 extrapolating and 1007 sustainable the word information has the letters info highlighted differently for the typical abbreviation despite the text splitting after the r a rather silly graphical styling a pie chart with one part labeled will and one part labeled be which is completely nonsensical as pie charts compare the sizes of two populations and will and be are merely words and are not being used as populations 6 years from now is more blindingly obvious fact at the time 2013 72 months is an unneeded and obvious conversion from six years; it is also false precision as 2019 january 1 arrives 63 months from the comic date the word months is also split across two lines mid syllable a corny illustration of megan telling hairy the word communicated and hairy enthusiastically responding yes despite the absurdity of the situation the word this in huge font and the word in with a bracket taking up an inordinate amount of space a venn diagram as anyone who has seen a venn diagram knows the two circles are two concepts or qualities and objects or concepts that fit inside the circles go within the words clear and concise plastered across the venn diagram have absolutely nothing to do with venn diagrams and are ludicrously inappropriate for this jumbled and overblown presentation but the word and is in the intersection of the two circles which is meta humorous in the lowermost bar graph the bar height shows the alphabetic position of each letter of the word format with t highlighted because it is the highest  it is also likely that this comic is a send up of the recent trend towards presenting information in tall graphics that are easily viewed on smartphone screens a tall graphic with the same pixel width as an iphone for example can viewed without zooming and using only vertical scrolling another discussion venue for the topic and this comic is gizmodo tall infographics suck the title text mentions the often hyped term big data big data normally refers to the challenges of working with and visualizing a quantity of data which is hard to process using traditional tools and methods randall now speaking unsarcastically tells us that just because the font size is huge doesn't mean you have handled the big data well
