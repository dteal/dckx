n this comic depicts an entertainment news television program hairy as the news anchor notes that all hollywood is in town meaning there are a lot of members of the film industry the event is a movie premiere a common place for reporters to interview celebrities actors and other people related to entertainment megan represents the reporter at the premiere reporting for the television program the red carpet is a tradition whereby a long red carpet is laid out leading to the entrance of a theater as a symbol of elegance movie stars are said to walk the red carpet when they arrive and do interviews and pose for photos along this carpet most famously seen at the oscars  when asked the ambiguous question how do things look instead of reporting on the premiere and the movie stars arriving megan reports on the bleak long term outlook for the earth as we know it she states than in about 800 million years the sun will become so hot that the earth's oceans boil away according to the wikipedia article this will though first happen in about 11 billion years but the 800 million years may have been the best estimate back in 2012 when this comic was released see for instance this article from 2013 that states 850 million years the loss of oceans will still happen long before the sun turns into a red giant in about 5 billion years  when hairy then asks how the stars are reacting meaning how the movie stars are reacting to this news about the oceans megan instead replies that the stars are reacting with hydrogen fusion the nuclear reaction of actual stars like the sun thus again mistaking  all astronomical stars eventually die when there is not enough hydrogen or other heavier atoms to continue the fusion process that keeps the stars stable  hairy then clarifies that he of course meant the movie stars but megan keeps being bleak in her reporting as she notes that they also won't last forever and by the way no one else will she is of course right as eventually everyone dies just as the stars will eventually die but of course much sooner for any living human movie star or not this reminding people that they will soon die is a common thing for xkcd apart from the whole segment of comics to make one feel old there is a specific example in 1393 timeghost and even more so in 926 time vulture in the title text hairy ask about the buzz about the film the buzz here refers to ongoing discussion of the movie analogous to a continuous humming sound megan exclaims that she hopes this buzz distracts people from the apparently grave news she has already reported also since premiere etymologically means first the title might be a pun on the comic number which only consists of four ones 1111 the joke of megan answering a question in an interview in an unexpected manner was used again in 1302 year in review
