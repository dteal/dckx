n cueball and megan are watching a movie on a couch during the movie a scene features a character's face with legible text projected by the monitor though commonly depicted for dramatic effect this phenomenon does not actually occur with conventional monitor technology megan is annoyed and agitated by the inaccuracy of the effect cueball agrees and delves more into the optical underpinnings of projected images but in the process segues into a romantic memory of the two of them in a parked car in the rain at that point the two lose interest in the movie and begin making preparations to drive to the nearest rainstorm for another romantic evening experience the title text offers further poetic allusion to the rainy car romantic scene
