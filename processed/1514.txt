n this comic proposes a new calendar system named permacal a  malamanteau of the words permanent and calendar in it the date stays constant in order to accomplish that as each day passes it is interpreted as drift and a new permacal leap day analogous to the leap day of the gregorian calendar is added to compensate in the comic which was published on monday april 20 2015 megan wonders why today would be the 19th since cueball said it was the 19th a day ago cueball interprets the news from megan that a day has passed as drift in the date and resolves to add another a leap day to permacal so that his calendar will be correct he is presumably becoming frustrated that he has to do this so often leap days in the gregorian calendar are days added to the end of february every year that is a multiple of 4 but not by 100 unless it's also a multiple of 400 the purpose is to synchronize the calendar with earth's orbit without having a partial day each year leap seconds are necessary because the earth rotation is not constant but speeds up and slows down over time the leap seconds account for the differences in the length of our 24 hour day and a solar day the time taken for earth to rotate once with respect to the sun and are announced several months beforehand ntp servers are used to keep local computer time from drifting they also are used to announce leap seconds in the context of this comic leap seconds would refer to a different system in which there is a new leap second each second so the time also stays constant down to the resolution of one second this would require something like setting the ntp leap second bit anew every second the title text presumably refers to moving to a resolution of one millisecond via leap milliseconds this would require at least 1000 updates being requested every second using enormous network bandwidth and resulting in a distributed denial of service attack ddos situation the comic relates to several ddos problems due to ntp server misuse and abuse over the years part of the humor stems from the problems that leap seconds are causing for some computers 1 the last leap second disrupted computers at big companies such as reddit linkedin gizmodo and foursquare google first introduced a new approach of smearing the leap second smoothly changing the reported time over an undisclosed number of hours around midnight utc on december 31 2008 the smooth shape of the adjustment is graphed at synchronization math behind google leap second smear formula stack overflow a new calendar was also proposed in comic 1061 est
