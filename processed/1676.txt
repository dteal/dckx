n the comic refers to an irritating problem in laying out text to fit from margin to margin the problem of justification where you want multiple line text to line up on the left side common the right side less common or both sides which is commonly called full justification this strip is dealing with how to make text fit such that it lines up on both sides while still looking good sometimes as before a long word like deindustrialization there's no universal good way to make the typography work it is a difficult problem to make text look good and be easily legible especially in a narrow space with the biggest issue being how to handle words that are too long to fit nicely the comic shows several solutions to this problem some realistic and others less so but each partly or wholly unsatisfying giving up essentially means not attempting full justification for a particular line which means it will not fit with the rest of the layout letter spacing involves an conspicuously large amount of whitespace between letters suggesting a reading where each letter is a word until the reader recognizes what is intended this method is in somewhat common use in newspaper and magazine layout where it is generally known by the name tracking distance between all letters and kerning distance between particular pairs of letters that fit together easily however letter spacing is unavailable for justification purposes in some languages such as german in which it is used for emphasis as italics are in english hyphenation is confusing because it requires suspended recognition of the full word confusing the eye into seeing in the given case the non words deindus and trialization this creates difficulty in both pronouncing and parsing the word moreover the decision of when and where to hyphenate is non trivial particularly for automated text layout; for example breaking a word and leaving only two orphaned letters on the following line is generally considered an illegal hyphenation nevertheless hyphenation is a very common means of handling extreme cases stretching appears visually unnatural and unfamiliar and may present technical difficulties in rendering adding filler words is generally undesirable in the worst case the meaning may be unintentionally altered or the tone might be rendered too informal as in the given example and even in the best case the text becomes less concise and potentially more difficult to read automation is also difficult however filler words added by a human especially the original author of the text are the least visually conspicuous and may be the most practical solution in some scenarios finally adding a decorative image like snakes but not necessarily snakes in particular to fill the extra space is a justification practice of significant historical interest it was particularly common for illuminated manuscripts in the medieval era and remained prominent until the invention of the printing press but little modern relevance there may be a particular absurdity to using a snake as it can be read as a word such as the relationship between snake deindustrialization as would be done similar to a rebus in modern text layout programs some combination of the above strategies may be used to achieve the most visually consistent effect for example in one case hyphenation might be the best option to split a very long word while another line might be too long by only one or two letters in which case the program could apply a very slight degree of extra letter spacing too small for the average reader to notice the title text suggests that in order to facilitate the snakes method of solving the problem the unicode consortium the organization in charge of the common text standard unicode should add snake building characters similar in concept to the existing box drawing block to allow variable length snake images to be used as filling currently there are at least six snake characters in unicode not including at least ten more egyptian hieroglyphs that represent specific snakes some in specific combination with other hieroglyphs 1  u+1dc2 &#160; &#x1dc2; &#160; s&#x1dc2; a diacritical combining character used in americanist phonetic notation to indicate lenis weak articulation  u+2e92 &#160; &#x2e92; a cjk character which might be interpreted as snake  u+8675 &#160; &#x8675; another cjk character meaning snake  u+86c7 &#160; &#x86c7; another cjk character meaning snake  u+1d9dc &#160; &#x1d9dc; one of the poorly supported characters in the signwriting block  u+1f40d &#160; &#x1f40d; an emoji snake   one of the hieroglyphs u+13192 egyptian hieroglyph i009a is described in source documents as horned viper crawling out of enclosure so it is literally a snake building character non breaking in the title text refers to a similar process as zero width joiners and no break html and css; the whole snake would shift down if it were too wide to fit on a given line this suggestion would likely be rejected; the unicode consortium is very specific about which characters are added&#91;citation needed&#93; and always require a good reason&#91;citation needed&#93; before adding a character or set of characters to the standard strange decisions by the consortium have previously been referenced in 1253 exoplanet names 1513 code quality and 1525 emojic 8 ball within an hour or two of this comic being published a thread on the subject started on the unicode consortiumxe2x80x99s official unicode mailing list as of two days later itxe2x80x99s still running
