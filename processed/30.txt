n in the early days of xkcd and days when wikipedia was not quite in the mainstream consciousness randall didn't trust people to understand his comics or his references and often explained the joke in the title text as the title text says the donner party was a group of pioneers who set out west along a new route that was supposed to be easier to travel but ultimately proved slow and treacherous they became trapped in the sierra nevada mountains and many died low on food it is believed that many of the pioneers resorted to cannibalism eating the bodies of party members who had already died  in this comic three donner party members arrive at joe's restaurant where they have ordered a table for four as given by the fact that the maxc3xaetre d' knows they are the donner party and calls for a party of four the three declines the table since they are already full this suggests that they just have eaten the unknown to us fourth member of their party after they placed the order for a table at the restaurant but before they strolled over to it anyway  of course since they are not in a survival situation in this strip cannibalism would be completely unnecessary
