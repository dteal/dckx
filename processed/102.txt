n this comic is a reference to the back to the future film series specifically the first film in which the protagonist marty mcfly played by michael j fox travels back from 1985 present day for him to 1955 and accidentally interferes with his own parents' first meeting he must then arrange for them to fall in love before he ceases to exist from the paradox of his own parents never having children an unintended side effect of the way events occur is that his dad gains self confidence in the past and becomes less of a loser in the present as noted in the comic the time machine marty uses is built by his professor friend doctor emmett l brown christopher lloyd out of a delorean dmc 12 a 1980s era sports car cueball or possibly hairy as the art could be inconsistent on this early comic has a very similar experience he suggests that the aforementioned changes to history are what he really needed to do after a frame of awkward silence megan reminds him that her father was in the world trade center north tower xe2x80x93 implying that he died along with several thousand others in 1 world trade center on september 11 2001 at the time the tower collapsed due to a terrorist flown passenger jet crashing into the building megan is therefore implying that saving her father's life and perhaps the lives of the other 9/11 victims might have been something else of importance he needed to do xe2x80x94 perhaps something of significantly more importance he seems completely oblivious to what she is trying to suggest megan starts to explain but apparently decides that there's no point even trying to get through to him the title text could refer cueball/hairy megan's father or marty mcfly as a side note for the comic to make sense the events in the comic must take place after september 11 2001 and not 1985 as it is in the movie since no dates are mentioned cueball probably went back by thirty years because that's how far back marty travels in the film
