n the comic shows a seven segment display aka calculator style numbers with a countdown black hat explains that it is a countdown maybe to a supervolcano eruption however an unfortunately placed picture blocks view of the full display due to the form of a seven segment display the first digit could be 0 6 or 8 and five digits are completely blocked by the picture cueball is worried and ask him to move the picture but black hat lazily or teasingly refuses to move it  he has already teased that he doesn't know what the countdown is for his reply can either be understood as if he do not know which one of the seven potential supervolcanos it is counting down to or to which other cataclysmic event it is a countdown for such as a meteor strike or global nuclear war for instance it could also just be a general doomsday clock since it seems to be black hat's countdown it is safe to assume that he knows both what it counts down to and when it stops but he just likes to mess with peoples' minds the fully visible part starts at 2409 and based on the pace of the scene it seems to be in seconds thus it is unclear when the eruption might occur if the obscured digits are all 0s it could be as soon as 40 minutes on the other hand if the obscured digits are '899 999' there's another 285 million years to go; if they are '000 001' we have a little more than 3 years the choice of the picture is probably also interesting the image is distorted enough that you can imagine it as being two very different images   it could depict a setting sun either reflecting in an ocean or with a river possible also a lake running out of the picture but if it is a sun it is not very circular although there do appear lines to indicate it is shining this could maybe be explained with atmospheric interference alternatively it depicts an exploding volcano a mountain with lines away from it to indicate the explosion or the eruption and then it is lava flowing away from it or collecting in lakes  in either case it makes sense so maybe this is on purpose if it is a volcano the supervolcano clock makes sense on the other hand we are talking about the possible end of the world as we know it and for this kind of theme a sun setting upon humanity would be a great metaphor the title text for all we know the odds are in our favor could imply the assumption that since we can't see the digits behind the picture we can treat them as random if so chances are only 1 in 300 000 they are all zeros however because of statistical principles such as benford's law the digits are not entirely random and the odds are higher than 1/299 999 for all the digits to be zero since the middle 4 digits are zero the title text might also be a reference to the hunger games trilogy with a common phrase in the series being may the odds be ever in your favor the first movie in the series came out about a year before this comic was released finally the odds could refer to odd numbers meaning that if the hidden digits form an odd number hence being non zero everything will be fine in an alternative view the strip is not about pondering at distributions of digits on an oracle countdown it's more of a grim view of our natural disasters prediction capabilities as they say xe2x80x93 the question is not if it will happen but when it will happen move the picture would mean investing into research and warning systems that would correspond to shifting the picture to the left disregard the 40 minutes think of it as arbitrary interval of interests minuscule as we folks have them say one's lifetime; or grimmer yet some term of office because hey year after year passes and no apocalypse has been observed the empirical odds are low indeed an interesting question is what we would use the knowledge of the timing of our impending doom if it is an event we can do nothing about such as stopping a supervolcanic eruption or a large asteroid with direct impact course on earth would we not have lives more happily for our remaining years how few that might be while not knowing on the other hand if the event is something we might prevent given enough time to plan and the funding resources such knowledge would ensure then it may have saved us if we moved the picture just in time using a countdown theme for comic #1159 could be a subtle joke as 1159/2359 is one minute to midnight on the doomsday clock supervolcanos was also referenced in the title text of 1053 ten thousand and it is the subject of in 1611 baking soda and vinegar
