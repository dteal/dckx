n cueball is seen at his desk in front of four devices he has clearly run out of things to do or is looking for an excuse to procrastinate a flowchart describes the process by which he scans the whole environment for something to do which everyone can relate to the comic uses electronics likely because they are the common time killer these days and are most likely to contain fresh tantalizing entertainment news sites can be viewed as a good source of yet to be seen content yet the search yields no interesting content or the results don't garner enough attention thus the blank stares and moving on to next device in line cueball has four devices so he can begin with the pc and move through the loop three times first to laptop then tablet and finally to smartphone the title text notes that this also happened before there were electronic devices like today assuming most entertainment came from books the point made is that while the internet and modern electronic devices are often blamed for jeopardizing the minds of adolescents the attention span of the kids is not worse than it ever was neither in the context of low tech nor high tech media kids focus on some things for a long time but they do change this focus often very abruptly but nevertheless there are still many kids reading books today until the end the title text could also be considered to imply another type of loop in which various generations experience the same situations under different circumstances ie history repeating itself in this case the new generation experiences the attention lapse loop with electronics whereas the previous generation experienced this same loop with books there may also be a commentary present on the shorter attention span of the current generation as opposed to the previous one in that there is an obvious terminus to the electronics loop while the book loop could extend nearly indefinitely
