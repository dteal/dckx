n it has been said that maps with the south pole at the top will change your perspective of the world such a map can easily be achieved by simply rotating a normal map 180 degrees though the text labels would also be upside down and perhaps harder to read a google images search reveals many examples of upside down maps with the text oriented correctly for reading 977 map projections is also relevant this map is a comedic play on that where instead of the whole map being upside down each land mass is in the same position it would be in a traditional north top map but rotated 180 degrees presumably around some central point of the landmass to the orientation it would have in a south top map note that individual islands are rotated about their own centers not following the rotation of the neighboring continent; however some are displaced as necessary to keep them from being overlapped by the rotated continents for instance madagascar would be overlapped by the sahara if it remained in position but is instead displaced eastward to keep it in the indian ocean on the other hand all the islands of the mediterranean sea have disappeared under asia asia is so broad that almost the entire indochinese peninsula with for instance vietnam and thailand has been rotated out of the top of the map similarly the map omits antarctica in the south to keep their familiar shapes on a rectangular map the continents would also have to be heavily distorted compared to their actual shapes becoming much narrower along the lines of latitude near the poles and wider towards the equator see also 977 map projections the basic climates for several areas would be distinctly different for example the formerly central america area would be in the arctic zone while siberia would be subtropical this arrangement of the world's land masses would have great advantages for trade because there are presumably navigable straits between the americas and between africa and asia removing the need for the panama canal and the suez canal the title text references the fact that in this new map the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland uk is now next to asia specifically the korean peninsula north korea is mentioned in the text having a history of hostile relations with nearby countries however on this map north korea would be the part of korea we today know as south korea further northern ireland is now at the south of the island of ireland so the uk's full name would need to change to the united kingdom of great britain and southern ireland there have been several wars concerning the english channel mainly but not only between england and france likewise there has been a history of animosity between korea and japan separated by a similar body of water since a channel now on this world map exists between the uk and north korea the real world's south korea there could obviously have been many wars for the dominance over said channel along the same line of thinking interesting speculations could be made from the following new facts  cuba is now off the east coast formerly west coast of canada and usa japan is next to the coast of portugal and spain madagascar lies next to morocco and mauritania on the east coast formerly west coast of sahara taiwan is now next to france it is though doubtful whether they get along any better with the french than with the mainland chinese greenland lies next to mexico sri lanka is located next to the yamalsky district of russia the island tierra del fuego an island just south of the southern tip of south america which is divided between argentina and chile is now located in a similar manner next to colombia and venezuela so it would probably have been divided between these two countries the falkland islands not named in the map they are probably represented by the single island above the t in tierra where argentina and uk have an ongoing sovereignty dispute now could be claimed by ecuador or peru the mediterranean islands seem to have vanished entirely as they are now in approximately the same place as mongolia
