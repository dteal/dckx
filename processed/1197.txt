n this comic was probably a reaction to the installation service ninite removing adobe flash player from their free version the previous day flash removed from ninite the comic makes fun of adobe systems software that delivers new versions of adobe products to users' computers such as adobe updater which replaced adobe update manager and adobe download manager from akamai these software increments might either be technical to fix compatibility or security issues or they might add new features that would go unnoticed in addition these updates are downloaded automatically by default but the operating system might install them only if a user allows it to the frequency of software changes and changes in the way adobe allows users to download new software could result in confused users there is an actual message that a specific version of these updaters display  the adobe updater must update itself before it can check forupdates would you like to update the adobe updater now  in fact the general necessity of such update managers has often been questioned as they require the user to download software in order to download other software other notable examples of companies who use update managers include google and sun/oracle with the latter being also mentioned in the title text the two buttons 'ok' and 'download' are implied to have the same effect indicating the user has no real choice or alternatively 'ok' may simply just close the dialog without taking any action as that is common in informational popups in many pieces of software in that case the placement of the 'ok' button implies that it is the default action meaning most users will just ignore the update given the extreme frequency and perceived lack of changes to your average end user this anecdotally seems to be what most people do statistics for the high rate of un patched systems in the wild support the anecdotal evidence the language of the message also plays with repeated up and down as in there is an update for the adobe download manager to give the whole process a feel of preposterousness verging on carrollian literary nonsense the title text also suggests that using update helper software which in turn must be updated bears the risk of creating a dependency hell  the version 2112 of the oracle may refer to the rush suite 2112 where moment v is titled oracle and contains the lyrics i stand atop a spiral stair an oracle confronts me there
