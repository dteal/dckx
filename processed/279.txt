n this comic adds strange twists to some classic abysmally cheesy pickup lines warning terrible puns ahead  if i could rearrange the alphabet i'd put u and i together  cueball is making a your sister joke  is your father a thief because he stole all of the stars in the sky and put them in your eyesis your dad pick up lines  a jetta is a car and cueball is implying the father is an actual thief  you must be tired 'cause you've been running through my mind all night  he adds the word screaming to make the word running be literal instead of figurative  the title text refers to a pickup line like this that shirt looks good on you but would look even better on my bedroom floor but here the shirt is used as fuse for a molotov cocktail thrown into their office
