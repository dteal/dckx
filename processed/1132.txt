n this comic is a joke about jumping to conclusions based on a simplistic understanding of probability the base rate fallacy is a mistake where an unlikely explanation is dismissed even though the alternative is even less likely in the comic a device tests for the highly unlikely event that the sun has exploded a degree of random error is introduced by rolling two dice and lying if the result is double sixes double sixes are unlikely 1 in 36 or about 3% likely so the statistician on the left dismisses it the statistician on the right has we assume correctly reasoned that the sun exploding is far more unlikely and so is willing to stake money on his interpretation the labels given to the two statisticians in their panels and in the comic's title are not particularly fair or accurate a fact which randall has acknowledged1  i seem to have stepped on a hornetxe2x80x99s nest though by adding xe2x80x9cfrequentistxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cbayesianxe2x80x9d titles to the panels this came as a surprise to me in part because i actually added them as an afterthought along with the final punchline xe2x80xa6 the truth is i genuinely didnxe2x80x99t realize frequentists and bayesians were actual camps of peoplexe2x80x94all of whom are now emailing me i thought they were loosely applied labelsxe2x80x94perhaps just labels appropriated by the books i had happened to read recentlyxe2x80x94for the standard textbook approach we learned in science class versus an approach which more carefully incorporates the ideas of prior probabilities the frequentist statistician is misapplying the common standard of p&lt;005 in a scientific study a result is presumed to provide strong evidence if given that the null hypothesis a default position that the observations are unrelated in this case that the sun has not gone nova there is less than a 5% chance that the result was merely random the null hypothesis was also referenced in 892 null hypothesis since the likelihood of rolling double sixes is below this 5% threshold the frequentist decides by this rule of thumb to accept the detector's output as correct the bayesian statistician has instead applied at least a small measure of probabilistic reasoning bayesian inference to determine that the unlikeliness of the detector lying is greatly outweighed by the unlikeliness of the sun exploding therefore he concludes that the sun has not exploded and the detector is lying the line bet you $50 it hasn't is a reference to the approach of a leading bayesian scholar bruno de finetti who made extensive use of bets in his examples and thought experiments see coherence philosophical gambling strategy for more information on his work in this case however the bet is also a joke because we would all be dead if the sun exploded  if the bayesian wins the bet he gets money and if he loses they'll both be dead before money can be paid this underlines the absurdity of the premise and emphasizes the need to consider context when examining probability the title text refers to a classic series of logic puzzles known as knights and knaves where there are two guards in front of two exit doors one of which is real and the other leads to death one guard is a liar and the other tells the truth the visitor doesn't know which is which and is allowed to ask one question to one guard the solution is to ask either guard what the other one would say is the real exit then choose the opposite two such guards were featured in the 1986 jim henson movie labyrinth hence the mention of a labyrinth guard here
