n the kola superdeep borehole is the result of a scientific drilling project by the soviet union in what is now north western russia that began in 1970 and continued through 1992 it was an attempt to drill as far into the earth as possible the deepest hole reached 12262&#160;metres 40230&#160;ft it remains the deepest artificial point on earth megan mentions the well to hell hoax that the drilling hit a super hot cavern which is disproved at wwwsnopescom the well to hell although super hot temperature was the reason the project was abandoned no chamber or voices were discovered as megan notes the hoax plays on the popular notion that hell is literally a physical place below us xe2x80x94 therefore by definition towards the centre of the earth xe2x80x94 whereas heaven is above us; often depicted in the clouds megan suggests that the miners therefore sealed the hole to seal in hell there is no mention in the wikipedia article about the hole being sealed; however there is a picture with the caption the borehole itself welded shut if sealing the hole is considered to mean filling the entire hole up with concrete or some other material then given the potential for future scientific data the 22 years spent drilling and the cost of sealing the hole this would not seem to be a reasonable thing to do black hat suggests that if the hoax were true and the miners did believe they'd drilled into hell a better alternative to sealing the hole would have been to dig a canal to the ocean thereby allowing water to flow into the hole and into hell given the common depiction of a subterranean hell is characterized by fire and brimstone and extreme heat filling hell with water would both drastically alter the landscape and entirely flood hell megan never thought of that possibility and compliments black hat's ingenuity by suggesting that if there were ever a real conflict with hell she would want to be on his side given his clever suggestion on how to destroy hell he responds by suggesting that megan is nice and therefore probably won't be on his side this suggests black hat considers himself evil and thinks he would be fighting for hell or maybe on behalf of those consigned there rather than against it the title text parodies a nondescript news report of a person's death in this case it is about lucifer being killed by black hat carrying out his plan to flood hell however the report is written in a non descript way that ignores the presumed sensationalism of the story ie that hell exists and has been flooded it is notable that lucifer is often used in modern times to refer to satan and both are used to refer to the leader or keeper of hell although the bible never directly identifies them as the same entity and he/they are never tied directly to hell anywhere in the bible much of the modern image of hell is derived from dante's inferno along with a variety of additional details which have been added and changed throughout the years the reference to sharks is a reference to 1326 sharks that was released a week before
