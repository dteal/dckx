n ponytail and cueball walks in from the left to meet megan who comes from the right they are walking in between two trees while ponytail tells cueball that one day a year the sun sets directly between these two trees cueball's reply oh cool like the manhattan thing is a reference to manhattanhenge a phenomenon occurring twice a year that causes the setting sun to align with the east west streets of the main grid of manhattan new york causing a very special light display manhattanhenge is itself named after stonehenge an ancient monument consisting of several large stones where the heel stone and the embanked avenue are aligned to the sunset of the winter solstice and the opposing sunrise of the summer solstice thus creating on purpose the effect seen today in manhattan on specially intended dates hence the title of the comic which was released less than a week after the winter solstice which fell on 2015 12 22 after a beat panel cueball however realizes that one could make the setting sun line up with almost any two arbitrary trees on any given day this is due to the fact that the trees are effectively zero dimensional points on the surface rather than one dimensional lines like street grids so any two trees that are close together with one tree further north would allow a setting sun to set between them; the viewer of the sunset could simply move themselves to make the alignment work this is opposed to stonehenge/manhattanhenge which requires the sun to align with a straight line and only works on a few days a year the twist comes when ponytail and megan actually attempt to capture the setting sun with a butterfly net as it is revealed that the sun is somehow setting at the actual point between the two trees rather than behind the trees when viewed from the east side this is of course not possible in real life but in the comic's last panel and in the title text the girls continue with their successful though surrealistic plan if this was indeed our sun that they had somehow shrunk and cooled enough to captured with a butterfly net transfer to a bag and bring it home this would on xkcd  terms be no more strange than many of the strange powers of beret guy if this would indeed happen then since earth and the rest of the solar system is now missing its central star there would be a ton of problems for everyone on earth so the girls would probably be able to get a lot of money in ransom for releasing the sun but in the title text it turns out that they are just going to sell the sun on line alternatively this is not the sun but just a small sun look alike maybe a ball lightning which might actually be able to behave like this though one would not be able to capture it a bag or the girls simply play a theatrical show for the reader they know the comic's panel orientation reader's position and the view projection so they position themselves like the two trees between reader and the distant sun to look like they capture it with a butterfly net and a bag the title text refers to craigslist a web site where the girls plans to offer the sun for sale in hopes of getting rich craigslist is a classified advertisements website with sections devoted to jobs housing personals for sale items wanted etc one of the girls tells that she was uncertain as to under which category she should list a sun for sale but she put it under property as in real estate to advertise the property she put that it has 'good sun exposure a common description of real estate being the sun itself you could claim that it is well located compared to the sun but it will never really see any sun light itself as the only sun light that hits the sun is the light from other stars which is very dim the title text may also be a reference to a woman who was stopped by ebay after attempting to sell plots of land on the sun on the site lately randall has had his characters catch several things but never butterflies with a butterfly net the next instance of butterfly nets can be seen in 1635 birdsong released less than a month after this comic's release date wherein a bird is chased with a net
