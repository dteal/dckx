n brian eno is a musician and a co founder of the long now foundation he is explaining to an audience that one of the missions of the long now is a manual for civilization a collection of reference materials that can help rebuild society in case it  collapses but in randall's version the experts have made a list composed of many books from the animorphs series animorphs is a series of books written by ka applegate it follows a group of five children later an alien joins as the sixth member that try to stop the parasitic aliens the yeerks by transforming into animals a yeerk that enters a human has complete control over their host and can read their memories because the yeerks can imitate their host almost perfectly humanity is slowly being taken over without knowing it and for this reason the children cannot contact the authorities and are on their own in the battle against the yeerks when asked if all the books on the experts' list are from the animorph series eno misses the point of the question by saying no only to mention the megamorphs books and the andalite chronicles both of which are side stories to the animorph universe there are other books like these which aren't mentioned here xe2x80x94 but it is clear from the last two panels that it is a quite long list xe2x80x94 and it seems to be written in two columns so maybe all 54 animorphs books and all ten side stories could be included on the list in suggesting that a series of children's novels make up the blueprint for rebuilding civilization randall is spoofing the idea of such libraries since such books would be largely useless in terms of providing the detailed instructions that would be necessary the title text makes it completely ludicrous by saying an entire wing of the library will be devoted to the book #26 where two main characters who have been attracted to each other since the beginning of the series finally kiss while this is a momentous event for fans of the book series the information is of no consequence for the rebuilding of civilization this comic may also be inspired by isaac asimov's foundation series where hari seldon claimed that the galactic empire is going to collapse in three hundred years there is no way to stop it but his group of scientists are writing encyclopedia galactica to help people rebuild civilization  the long now foundation was mentioned recently in 1340 unique date animorphs was referenced before in the title text of 1187 aspect ratio and 1360 old files
