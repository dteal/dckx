n when they are very young cueball and megan runs away from cueball's two friends who looks much like cueball and megan as well they fall in love get married and grow old together megan begins to look like hairbun and the old cueball wears a sailor cap but it is obviously still megan and cueball from the first panel at the end cueball leaves his wife without saying goodbye or explaining why he leaves he returns to the same place where he left his two friends that has been waiting on him with the same box next to them and we must assume the same list they also had in the first picture and we finally learn that being happy was just another thing crossed off cueball's list of what is presumably the longest duration scavenger hunt of all time considering cueball grew quite old before ever completing that step on the list and when he did he just got up and left his lifelong wife because now he was ready for the next item on the list  the title of the comic is probably a reference to the saying that you find happiness together with your loved ones so after finding a penny and a snake skin he had to get married and old to be able to find happiness next he needs to find a four leaf clover a shark tooth and something obscured by the speech bubble to continue the hunt but before he continues he find that he is getting bored with this game as can be seen in the title text the treehouse reference in the title text is another example of a common childhood activity naturally the intended mental image is a bunch of old men building a treehouse and living and playing in it like six year olds and also typical for children to tire of a game before it is finished except here he already spend a lifetime on just one point the idea of adults having a fort in the woods was mentioned rather darkly in the title text of 219 blanket fort three of the old people looks very similar to three of those standing in line in 586 mission to culture
