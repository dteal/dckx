n the comic is a reference to a short story by isaac asimov the last question where humans kept asking successively more complex computers whether entropy can be reversed thereby preventing the heat death of the universe the computers always answered there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer in the end the final computer figured out the answer but there were no humans left to give the answer to the comic depicts a note to xe2x80x9cisaacxe2x80x9d isaac asimov the note asks isaac to identify whether he likes the note writer by choosing either xe2x80x9cyesxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cnoxe2x80x9d isaac is supposed to check an answer and hand the note back but isaac whose pen is red has written and selected a third answer there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer mirroring the way his computers in the short story responded notes of this form are stereotypically written by young schoolchildren to gauge or incite romantic interest this allows impatient children to get an answer during a class and timid children to get an answer without having to ask the person face to face title text is a reference to the ending in xe2x80x9cthe last questionxe2x80x9d the unique capitalization of isaac in this text implies that isaac is an acronym for a type of supercomputer named with a similar convention to the computers in the last question instead of the computer climatically coming up with the solution on how to save the universe from entropy when all humanity is gone like in the xe2x80x9cthe last question isaac comes up with the anticlimactic excuse of an answer 'i like you but i don't like like you' xe2x80x9clike likexe2x80x9d is a childish euphemism for romantic interest in the last question a character considers a thought that perhaps ac stands for analog computer but in reality this was never the case; for example eniac stands for electronic numerical integrator and computer and univac stands for universal automatic computer this title text may also be meant to imply that isaac asimov was a supercomputer the original story can be read here comic 1737 datacenter scale also references the short story in the title text
