n recently vic gundotra left google because he was the head of google+ this has caused many people including techcrunch to theorize that google+ is going to be shut down despite the continuing comments from google that it will remain active and updated google has a history of closing popular services listed the comic extrapolates this to an announcement that google would be closing all its popular services up to and including its e mail service gmail and even the core business of the company its internet search engine to wholly concentrate on a relatively obscure part of its product lineup according to google its public dns servers domain name system servers better known by their ipv4 addresses 8888 and 8844 are supposed to be a faster alternative to using one's isp's dns servers because of caching effects due to a large user base as well as less susceptible to censorship when turkey started blocking access to twitter and youtube in march 2014 turkish isps first did this on the dns level by manipulating the results from their own name servers the most popular workaround was using google's dns server instead so much so that its address was written as graffiti on the side of a building the joke may also be related to the fact that 8888 is an ip address heavily used by network administrators to perform connectivity tests ping because it is easy to remember and fast to type google would want to concentrate on this feature to build a business model using that fact the reason behind this decision may be that google considers a dns server a fairly low level component of the internet's service stack to be the optimal place to collect information on its users an accusation leveled at google ever since it introduced the service the title text refers to the impression held by some that google will shut down services that prove less popular than desired at short notice even though they may in fact have a significant user base a recent example of that is the closure of the rss aggregation service google reader in july 2013 while the same dns service is provided under both addresses the more memorable 8888 is likely to receive far more requests than 8844
