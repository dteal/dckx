n a new year comic where megan asks beret guy if he has any new year's resolutions and even though this is just before new year 2015 his resolution is to find out what an email is despite being in popular use since 1998 when free email providers appeared and having existed since before 1982 when smtp was established beret guy apparently doesn't understand what email is even though he maintains a web page that includes his email address megan wonders how else he expects electronic messages to be sent she explains that one must check email regularly making a slight at voicemail which she implies is not worth ever checking beret guy offers two alternatives fax and snapchat megan refers to snapchat as the naked pic thing calling to mind how many of its users send naked pictures of themselves over the internet beret guy replies that people use fax machines for more than just faxting a made up term similar to sexting implying that many people send sexual content via fax a technology that predates smtp by more than a decade beret guy knows what a fax is which implies he is very behind in the technology world so it makes sense he doesn't know what email is but he also knows what snapchat is which was very popular around the time of this comic either beret guy heard about it in a similar way to email or he definitely knows what it is and/or uses it what's strange is that if beret guy knows what snapchat is he should know what email is as well the title text which could be randall's new year's resolution for 2015 refers to various date/time formats in programming a point in time eg the current system time is usually stored and processed as a single number that represents the count of seconds that have elapsed since a given starting time known as epoch the unix standard epoch is january 1 1970 at midnight utc in order to make sense to people this number must be converted to a human readable format but programmers must choose a format that best meets the needs of their users this can be a complicated problem to solve given that there are many different standard formats for different regions different levels of precision for different applications and differences between universal time and a user's local time zone randall has previously advocated for widespread adoption of the iso 8601 format as a universal standard the title text also probably references a twitter outage that took place on december 29 which was blamed on an error in a date format string most programming languages provide functions to create a custom date format string using tokens that represent different parts of the date/time here randall appears to have used one of these functions with the string %y %m %d&#160;%h%m%s which looks like it should produce a date and time as year month day hourminutesecond however he used the wrong tokens for this  %y = 4 digit year 2014 %m = minute 54 %d expands to&#160;%m/%d/%y which is month/day/2 digit year in the user's local time zone rather than utc 12/30/14 see below %h = abbreviated month name dec %m = 2 digit month 12 %s = unix timestamp 1420001642 seconds since epoch  the %s token shows us the actual unix timestamp used 1420001642 which corresponds to 2014 12 31 at 045402 utc the format string shown above thus yields 2014 54 12/30/14 dec121420001642 note that the middle portion of this string shows 12/30 instead of 12/31 this is due to the&#160;%d token expressing the date in randall's local time zone eastern standard time or est which is 5 hours before utc the time there was 235402 or just before midnight on the previous day the correct format string for randall's apparent desired result is %y %m %d&#160;%h%m%s which gives the string 2014 12 31 045402 utc or 2014 12 30 235402 est given the similarity between randall's string and the correct one it is easy to see how this type of formatting is confusing and often frustrating for programmers particularly those not intimately familiar with these functions randall previously addressed date/time formatting in 1179 iso 8601 and 1340 unique date the latter of which uses a formatting string correctly this was the second comic in a row with megan holding a smart phone the first being 1466 phone checking the comic before that one was also about smart phones 1465 xkcd phone 2
