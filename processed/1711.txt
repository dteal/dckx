n snapchat is a photo sending app that allows the receiving user to only view the photo known as a snap within 24 hours of its posting and for only 10 seconds before it is deleted the pulitzer prize is famously awarded for exceptional journalism and photojournalism there are many categories; see here  cueball reads that the snapchat pulitzer prize has just been awarded but then when megan states that she heard the picture was really good cueball becomes disappointed because he realises he has already missed out on the chance to see the prize winning entry due to the temporary nature of snapchat note that megan also missed the opportunity to see the snap a given snap can be sent to a semi public story and the user decides how long any user can see the snap in a range from 1 10 s in principle any specific snap is only accessible for 24 hours even if it is a story a committee of users could have more than 10 seconds to access the snap by viewing in sequence given the time it might take for a committee to decide which snap wins the prize it is realistic that cueball learns about the winner after the 24 hours is up; thus even a user following the outcome might not be able to see the winning entry after that time in practice it is possible to circumvent the snapchat rule and take a screen shot or in other ways save the content of the snap in the case of a pulitzer prize winning photo someone would probably have saved it if it was in real life on the other hand the only way for the photo to be recognised as a snap eligible to win the prize would be if no one could see it for more than 10 seconds so one of the possible rules might be that any picture which was saved would not be able to win the prize this would be effectively impossible to enforce the title text extends this ephemeral nature of snapchat's content to the prize awarded for it the other pulitzer prizes are announced annually in april and awarded in may except for 2016 the centennial year when an awards dinner will be held in october the snapchat pulitzer prize alone must be awarded as quickly as possible after the winner has been decided before the prize committee forgets what the winning picture looked like this of course underlines how silly this idea is because only images seen during the assembly of the prize committee can be seen and remembered and it is not possible to arrange this based on any knowledge of when a pulitzer prize worthy snap will be released randall could be making fun of snapchat see the title and the idea that you cannot save the images for later; as mentioned regarding screenshots it is actually very easy to save pictures from snapchat to many a user's regret after having sent something very personal such as naked pictures of themselves the comic could also be seen as mocking the pulitzer prize for having too broad a spectrum of categories alongside the photojournalistic and prose awards the pulitzers also honor a variety of artistic pursuits including poetry drama and music  the new medium of snapchat is certainly a hybrid form of art and information/opinion dispersal both at its best and at its worst but it is too ephemeral for awarding prizes to be logistically possible even if it were taken seriously enough for someone to want to award them the very next comic 1712 politifact features an organization which was awarded the pulitzer prize for national reporting in 2009
