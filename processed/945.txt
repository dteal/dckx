n in many english speaking countries including the us when someone presents the other with bad news they respond with a sympathetic i'm sorry that is different from the apologetic i'm sorry that a person would give for something that is their fault some people however choose to be pedantic and refuse to accept the phrase since the other person isn't guilty of anything this can be annoying to people who view it as a common phrase which should be accepted as a normal idiosyncrasy of the language as it says below the comic cueball switches his sympathetic i'm sorry when megan being pedantic does not accept the i'm sorry because it was not his fault instead of agreeing with her cueball says i know what i did implying that he did in fact burn down her mother's house an act which she would not expect at the title text you know i've always hated her is an explanation for burning down the house albeit an insufficient one it is unlikely that he actually burned her house down but rather is simply teaching megan a lesson not to nitpick so much
