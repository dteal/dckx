n this comic shows a map of the world the x in the center labeled me indicates randall's approximate location in the us and two arrows point west and east from it the map uses a format popular in america which places the american continents centrally therefore splitting asia parodied by you cut asia in half the comic then shows europe labeled the west as it is commonly referred to despite being located to the east of randall and asia similarly labeled the east despite being west of randall randall is therefore annoyed with the common terms the west and the east referring to locations east and west of him respectively the east and the west were defined in geographical terms from the traditional boundary between europe and asia  they were later expanded or mis appropriated to include references to cultural political and trade connections  another east west division comes from zero longitude the prime meridian the western hemisphere and eastern hemisphere are defined in reference to it and world maps are often centered on it  the fact that the prime meridian runs though london england is an artifact of the british empire's dominance xe2x80x94and british exploration of the worldxe2x80x94 in the 1700s and 1800s in particular british astronomical tables made by the royal observatory in greenwich london were widely used to determine longitude all over the world  the need for establishing a precise zero longitude is one of the two technological necessities to make a sextant work as a tool to calculate accurate position for map making in short the east and the west should simply be viewed as a reference to map coordinates and not as relative to where you are as suggested by the comic  an america centered map does not redefine the east or the west anymore than an australian up side down reversed map redefines the north or the south    the convention of orienting maps with north at the top and west at the left was started by the greek geographer ptolemy in his work geography he introduced the first coordinate system with latitude and longitude randall shows some other possible map orientations in 977 map projections the title text comments on the similarity in shape of new zealand and japan and suggests that one may in fact be the other in disguise the similarities are partly explained by both forming as volcanic island chains
