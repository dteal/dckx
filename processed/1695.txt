n the comic is a continuation of 1513 code quality in which we see ponytail being introduced to the source code cueball has written and where he is warning her that he is self taught so his code probably won't be written the way she is used to in the first comic she continues to describe poetically the total mess of a code she encounters using references to a child building houses recipes created by corporate lawyers or the transcript of a couple arguing at ikea as well as using emojis in the code title text in this comic she continues this trend in four more abusive comments after starting this sequel with a short remark on how she hates reading cueballxe2x80x99s code cueball is not even shown in this comic only replying twice off panel but as the title makes it clear this is a sequel there can be no doubt that it is cueball with the four remarks here as well as a fifth in the title text she has now managed to make no less than nine derogatory remarks on cueball's programming skills in the second panel ponytail makes a reference to ocr optical character recognition a technique for recognizing text in a picture using software in this case she is referring to a picture of a scrabble game which is a popular word making game in which players have a pseudo randomized set of letters and must arrange them on a grid to form interlocking words ocr software is notoriously imperfect at the time of writing and the criss crossing semi random words on a scrabble board fed through an ocr program would likely produce dubious results certainly not fit for current code standards ponytail observes that cueballxe2x80x99s code includes the javascript reserved words more often than a typical scrabble board would a concession that the code looks at least vaguely code like reserved words such as xe2x80x98functionxe2x80x99 xe2x80x98ifxe2x80x99 and xe2x80x98returnxe2x80x99 are fundamental building blocks of code and most code uses them often they are called xe2x80x9creservedxe2x80x9d because those words are reserved for their actual meanings such as defining a function xe2x80x93 programmers may not create variables with those names as for why xe2x80x9ctriple pointsxe2x80x9d translates to a prevalence of those words scrabble's point system is based on the value of individual letters combined with certain modifier squares on the game board which can boost points triple points is the highest class of modifier available in the game though it can be for triple points on a specific letter or the entire word and is highly sought after by players the third panel continues ponytail's rant this time referencing naval weather forecasts avian interference and indentation a weather forecast is a complex multidimensional array of data used in predicting or assessing the atmospheric conditions of a geographical area over a set time naval weather forecasts use an extremely condensed code to send their information rendering them unintelligible to an untrained reader transcribing it would be further complicated by a woodpecker a bird noted for its rapid successive pecking motions hammering pecking the shift key on the keyboard which would result in many letters being randomly capitalized indentation is the practice of shifting a section of text further from the starting margin which in coding is typically used to organize functions and statements but if done randomly would only serve to scramble the code hierarchy the fourth panel references famous poet e e cummings and user name suggestions edward estlin cummings was a poet who used capitalization punctuation and line breaks in unconventional ways websites that offer membership often also require that users create a pseudonym known as a username for use in tracking/authenticating their actions on the site as well as identifying them to the site's community many of these sites also require usernames be unique on popular sites many common words phrases and names have already been reserved by users so when signing up for them many people run into situations where the name they want has already been taken on many sites where this happens the site may suggest alternate usernames usually based on the one that was entered to begin with for example if the username hedgeclipper is already reserved the site may recommend hedgeclipper1234 or h3dg3clipp3r instead depending on the algorithm behind the suggestions in other cases websites requiring users to enter personal information such as their name may suggest a username based on their name with a string of digits after it such as joshua1128 an e e cummings poem written entirely out of these semi random suggestions would make the resulting poem even more unusual than his work is already considered the last panel's simile involves markov chaining chat bots presumably bus schedules and potential gross vehicular negligence applied markov chaining is a process used in many computer algorithms that try to simulate real world concepts such as speech simulation and decisions making its inherent randomness also makes it a candidate for unpredictable things such as stock market analysis and speech recognition bus schedules are often complicated and full of notation and are notorious for confusing people who are not used to reading them chat bots using applied markov chains to recognize and respond to speech/text rely on the input being clear and well organized in plain language feeding bus schedules to such a bot would likely result in the returns being complete gibberish and unreadable the issue is further complicated when ponytail suggests that the schedules are from a city where the buses crash constantly which would be horrifying if it happened so regularly that the schedules actually took crashes into account even more horrifying would be the further unpredictability of the output of the chat bot from such unpredictable input cueball finally comments that xe2x80xa6 it runs fine for now which indicates he knows the code has problems but it reluctant to fix them because it's more or less serving its function ponytail quips back that so does a burning bus which is technically true but the for now part implies that disaster and injury could result at any moment as would likely happen on a burning bus in the title text ponytail makes a final remark a formal grammar is a way of describing the structure of text such that computers can recognize or generate such text a raw database dump is an export of the data from a database for the purposes of transferring it to another database or importing it into a program viewed xe2x80x9crawxe2x80x9d without processing to make it easy for humans to read quickbooks is an accounting software package the company collapsing in an accounting scandal implies their accounting database would be a mess even in a human readable format
