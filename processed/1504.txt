n this comic is talking about the robotic science platform opportunity on january 25 2004 the opportunity rover landed on the surface of mars for the purpose of gathering data about the surface of mars opportunity has proven remarkably robust and the comic extrapolates the rover's resilience to absurdity for comedic effect as of the release date of this comic in 2015 the opportunity rover is still alive and moving  the comic depicts the two scientists ponytail and hairbun at ground control being amazed at this fact already in 2010 and maybe the same two scientists continue to debate this at present day in the second panel they mention another martian rover spirit that was also sent to mars on the same date as opportunity unfortunately it became stuck and a sand storm covered its solar panels on march 22 2010 it was thought that spirit's batteries finally ran out marking the end of its mission this was covered in 695 spirit in which the spirit rover is also portrayed with an anthropomorphic personality however in 2023 opportunity has apparently become so powerful that it has become dangerous presumably cannibalizing or destroying the rover sent in 2020  cueball and megan note it even continues to operate without its original battery suggesting it has developed a new power source  this evolution is similar to the stories of hal 9000 from 2001 a space odyssey and v'ger from star trek the motion picture both of which became dangerous to human beings by 2450 humans have colonized and terraformed mars maybe it is the 2023 cueball and megan's descendants that are looking out over their huge kingdom from the capital on mars however opportunity is by now dominating half of the planet and will not allow humans to enter its dark reign  everything the light touches is a reference to a line by mufasa in the lion king mufasa's son simba then asks what about that shadowy place and mufasa tells him that is beyond our borders you must never go there this was used again in 1608 hoverboard where cueball tells the same line to ponytail in the left part of the world the title text forecasts the first words of the first astronauts on the surface of mars at first the astronaut copies the first words of neil armstrong on the moon that's one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind but it is interrupted by the opportunity rover on board the rover is a drill used for sampling rocks but here it is heavily suggested that opportunity uses the drill to attack the astronaut
