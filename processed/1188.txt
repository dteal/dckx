n this is source code written in the java programming language which models a parent and a child playing a game of catch in which the parent throws a ball to their child who catches it and throws it back which repeats the comic title bonding refers to the building of relationship between the parent and the child but the computer program representation of this game is funny using a play on the keywords throw and catch and throwable which in java do not correspond to throwing and catching a ball but to a so called exception handling a method of signaling error conditions and responding to them the program as written will recursively call the aim method alternately on the parent and the child indefinitely until the program crashes with a stack overflow also the terms parent and child are usually interpreted more abstractly in programming as a generic terms used in hierarchical data structures the title text refers to eclipse which is a tool commonly used to develop software in java building character is something that you would expect a parent to do in order to instill in his child positive traits such as athleticism this is possibly a reference to calvin and hobbes where calvin's dad often encourages him to build character in a number of ways including playing baseball this is made more likely by other references combining technology and c+h such as xkcd comics 409 702 and 1002 however here build might also be a play on the term of building a program while character refers to a data type it may also refer to the common notion that programming in c++ or java builds character due to their powerful but sometimes finicky libraries
