n cueball has messed up his linux server apparently not for the first time megan offers to take a look at the pc and she casually types in 'ls' xe2x80x94 a very basic command that lists the files in the current directory the computer returns a bizarre error message xe2x80x94 it trips over one of the simplest commands indicating that cueball's system is messed up really messed up the /usr/share path should indicate architecture independent shared data adobe is a software company that produces acrobat flash and photoshop android vm would be a virtual machine for android the jar extension suggests a java language program none of adobe software android or java are needed to run 'ls' all of the above have nothing to do with each other with the exception that android applications but not core command line utilities like ls are written in java also basic system executables like 'ls' would never be placed within /usr/share or within some 'example' or 'doc' directory on linux executables don't have filename extensions like exe or jar additionally it would require the folder to be within $path in other words the error message implies that the server is in a very bad state in the last frame megan is bewildered by this result and asks what did you do cueball suggest a course of action which mimics a common error message ______ is busy please try again later obviously he has seen this type of message frequently enough to try it as a general cure in all similar cases megan then tells cueball to shut down the system and wait for the singularity referring to a hypothetical future event when superintelligence can be artificially created since future superintelligent humans/computers transcend our comprehension we can't predict or even understand what will happen after the singularity one interpretation is that megan is telling cueball that his system is such a mess that it will take a post singularity superintelligence to fix it or run it in its current state as only an intelligence beyond present comprehension would be capable of doing it also indicates that 1668 singularity could be the sequel to this comic the title text is yet another protip from randall ray kurzweil is an author and futurist who has talked and written much about a technological singularity presumably mangling the jargon by confusing the concept of the singularity with the science fiction term cyberspace is something kurzweil as an expert would find annoying also as randall later pointed out in 1573 cyberintelligence the word has not really been used for a decade
