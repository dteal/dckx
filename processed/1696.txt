n developing artificial intelligence ai has been a challenge for a long time even to develop one with the intelligence of a six year old child would be a great milestone and presumably a stepping stone on the path to making one with the intelligence of an adult human in this comic randall/cueball jokingly suggests that in order to accomplish this goal one can give him an ai that's already as smart as an adult and let him teach it childish and silly things he is shown teaching it dumb jokes much like the ones a sassy six year old would make as the first fart joke where artificial is changed to fartificial the humor in the comic is that randall is essentially accomplishing the present goal of a six year old equivalent ai by starting with the final goal which is a full human intelligence and making it dumber just by teaching it poor humor this is not unlike the old joke the easiest way to make a small fortune on wall street or similar is to start with a large one the specific situation may also be a reference to tay a microsoft chatbot that was taught to troll within hours of its exposure to the public updog refers to a light hearted practical joke in which the perpetrator casually uses the neologism 'updog' in a sentence hey i'm going to get some updog you want any the unsuspecting listener is expected to be curious about the meaning of the neologism and ask the perpetrator its meaning specifically in the format what's 'updog' inadvertently invoking the highly casual greeting of what's up dawg the perpetrator then draws attention to this by replying along the lines of not much you causing the target to realize the foolish thing they just said other neologisms used in the context of this joke include 'updoc' 'snoo' and 'samatta' what's up doc what's new and what's the matter respectively updog is mainly an american joke not particularly well known in other english speaking countries in the title text there is a joke on lambda calculus where lambda is changed to shambda lambda calculus is an area of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science it is a formal language which can express computation and evaluation it is turing complete which means it can do any computation which can be executed by a computer however it is very simple consisting only of two primitive notions abstraction which is forming a function and application which is applying a function to an input value for example a function which squares a given number can be written xcexbbxxxc2xb2 here the xcexbb indicates an abstraction hence the name lambda calculus the x is the input value and the output is xxc2xb2 as an example of application if we apply this function to 5 we get xcexbbxxxc2xb25 = 5xc2xb2 = 25 the title text makes fun of this by inserting the word sham into the phrase a word used to describe a trick or con; essentially it denies that such calculus is useful or valid the title text finishes with amirite short for am i right which is often used to finish sentences on web forums to prevent anyone saying you are wrong not very mature to use in a serious discussion so very fit to use for a ai that tries to emulate the intelligence of a six year old the ai tip in the caption relates to the protip category
