n a sesquiannual meeting is one that occurs one and a half times every year; equivalently 3 times every 2 years or once every 8 months this could be taken even more literally by having one meeting during each year and another meeting which spans midnight every other new year's eve thus having a one and a half meetings each year the term comes from the latin prefix sesqui  which means one and a half and annual which equates to xe2x80xa6one per year xe2x80x9csesquiannualxe2x80x9d should not to be confused with xe2x80x9csesquiennialxe2x80x9d meaning a half and one years perxe2x80xa6 or every one and a half years 18 months note that the wiktionary entry on sesquiannual has both meanings listed xe2x80x93 both 8 month and 18 months intervals this is an extension of the common confusion between biannual meaning twice a year and biennial meaning once every two years compare with the sesquicentennial exposition celebrating the first 1&#189; centuries of the united states and sesquibicentennial being 'half and two' hundred years ie 250 the joke suggests that only a competent linguist could understand the word xe2x80x9csesquiannualxe2x80x9d one reason for this is that the prefix xe2x80x9csesqui xe2x80x9d is rare so those who know its meaning are likely to be linguists another is that a competent linguist should be able to distinguish between xe2x80x9csesquiannualxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9csesquiennialxe2x80x9d if you understand this then you can join the linguistics club while most organizations attempt to ensure that the schedule of their meetings are clear to participants so that everyone will attend the club in the comic deliberately instills an ambiguity for those outside their target demographic their membership will thus swell with the desired cognoscenti who remain unconfused and maybe also a few lucky guessers once the applicant correctly understands the frequency of meetings presumably they are told at least one meeting date in the cycle so that an attendance can be made  regarding the title text a tautology is a statement that is true or self evident because of its logical form such as all birds are birds or a = a as such the statement the tautology club meets on the date of the tautology club's meeting is itself tautological while the membership requirement for the linguistics club is merely to know the intended frequency the tautology club's stipulation appears to require an eligible member to derive a valid meeting date from thin air without any clue at all and no indication that there is even a regular cycle of any kind this would definitely be more of a challenge the title text has a connection to 703 honor societies in which cueball announces that xe2x80x9cthe first rule of tautology club is the first rule of tautology clubxe2x80x9d
