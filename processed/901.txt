n this is a play on the fact that many digital thermometers look similar to pregnancy tests cueball perhaps feeling ill thinks he is using a thermometer to measure his body temperature and determine if he has a fever as a male he is presumably doubly surprised when the thermometer tells him instead that he is pregnant the two bars on the thermometer are similar to lines that appear on a traditional pregnancy tests one bar is the control line; it will become visible given any normal urine sample if it doesn't appear the test is invalid the other bar the test line reacts to human chorionic gonadotropin a hormone that's released during pregnancy if both lines become visible the test result is positive; if only the control line becomes visible the test result is negative other results are invalid since the control line didn't appear thermometers are typically used to measure temperature and the title text notes that this clever thermometer has also detected a fever in the baby
