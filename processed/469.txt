n in the second of the original star wars film star wars episode v the empire strikes back just before han solo portrayed by harrison ford is frozen in carbonite the following conversation occurs  leia i love you han i know  the original script had han solo respond with i love you too but harrison ford felt that the character would not give such a cliched response even in the face of likely death and ad libbed the i know line that was actually used in the finished film the ad libbed line is generally thought to be better than the original would have been the comic presents several alternative ad libs that ford could have made in that conversation as well as at various points throughout the original trilogy so in this situation it is the actor ford and not han solo that speaks the lines      row   col   ad lib   further detail    1   1   well duh   here han ruins the mood a dramatic confession with a flippant statement    1   2   seriously christ   another example of an out of tone ad lib the original line is never tell me the odds a nod to solo's daredevil persona in this ad lib however he is hesitant to try anything dangerous    1   3   oh hey that explains the kissing earlier   another absurd out of character answer to a serious remark this time with solo acting romantically oblivious rather than forward as he is usually    2   1   i'm nailing your brother   so far leia doesn't know she has a brother luke also since to nail means to penetrate she may be surprised to learn that han is currently engaged in a same sex relationship or at least an ongoing arrangement this panel is referenced in the title text    2   2   hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for scissors though they do beat paper and rock   the original line is hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid a reference to luke's force training and lightsaber use in this ad lib han turns a discussion about weapons into a unusually formal discussion about the game rock paper scissors    2   3   cool listen this thing is really really cold   han is in a freezing chamber in this scene this remark indicates that he is not very interested in leia's feeling at this moment since he is so cold    3   1   wowzers   wowzers is an expression used by inspector gadget; another amusingly out of character ad lib    3   2   barely they're pretty drunk   the original response here is uh my team's ready i don't have a command crew for the shuttle in this ad lib han responds to a serious situation preparations for an important mission to bring down the galactic empire with an unserious response and an admission that he's allowing his crew to drink while on duty    3   3   man me too but chewie never seems interested maybe i should grow my hair out   the original response was i can arrange that  you could use a good kiss  in the original film leia's remark i'd just as soon kiss a wookiee is meant as an insult to han implying that he's no more attractive than a great hairy monster in this ad lib though han takes her statement literally and suggests that he is also interested in kissing a wookiee chewbacca is han's wookiee copilot and fellow smuggler han's suggestion that he's interested in kissing chewbacca is unexpected on many levels firstly han's shown interest in leia secondly chewbacca is an entirely different species and thirdly chewbacca is also male and han solo is presumed by leia to be straight  note although it's spelled wookie in the comic the canonical spelling of chewbacca's species is wookiee the title text continues the ad lib in panel four it refers to the plot twist that luke skywalker is princess leia's brother which would not be revealed until the next film in the series how harrison ford knows this twist at this point in the story is unknown
