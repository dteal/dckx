n cueball is telling white hat about his attempt at debugging ie the process of finding out what is wrong with a given computer problem which can become increasingly difficult and convoluted in this case cueball had a problem with his browser his attempts to solve this problem led him to a problem with the device driver for his keyboard chasing that issue he found an unclear error message from a system utility and so on cueball decides to make a long story short by skipping several steps he believes are boring and he unexpectedly reveals this process has led him to find the xe2x80x9csword of martin the warriorxe2x80x9d a legendary relic from the children's fantasy novel series redwall this refers to the fact that a complicated riddled path was devised in the series that would lead to the sword which is similar to the process of debugging as it involves following clues to achieve an answer but apart from that they are entirely different this is pointed out by white hat who states that at some point in the process he switched from the puzzle of debugging to the redwall puzzle of finding martin's sword redwall has been referenced before most prominently in 370 redwall; where martin and the sword can be seen; but also in 1286 encryptic and more recently in 1688 map age guide googling an error message is a common method used during debugging often leading to useful information however when there are no search results for a given message it means the problem is so obscure that almost nobody had experienced it before see also 979 wisdom of the ancients about getting only one result or as the title text hints it might mean it was a hidden clue to the location of martinxe2x80x99s sword
