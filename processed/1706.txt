n cueball has sent a dna sample to a genetic genealogy company the implied premise of the comic is that cueball intended to send his own dna to one of the several companies that analyze human dna samples and provide a report as to the genetic history of that person examples include notable/famous ancestors or relatives ethnic background risk factors for certain medical conditions etc however the result that cueball receives is consistent with a report for a dog pedigree test breaking down the percentage of certain species present in a dog's ancestry megan suggests that cueball has sent his sample to the wrong company cueball appears to agree in principle but seriously or jokingly it is unclear indicates that he intends to hedge his bets and avoid chocolate just in case he actually is in fact a dog dogs are generally susceptible to poisoning from theobromine a compound found in chocolates which causes seizures and heart failure in dogs and many other creatures basically if cueball really is a dog then eating chocolate could kill him 82% or 94% of genes depending on how you measure it are shared between humans and dogs  national geographic erroneously reported that only 5% of human dna is shared with dogs and mice which may have misled randall munroe  this leads to several possible interpretations of the comic it is possible as cueball suggests in the last panel that he is in fact a dog with excellent human impersonation skills or that he somehow shares dna with a dog it is possible that cueball mistakenly sent a sample of a dog's dna perhaps his own somehow thinking that is the method of testing his own dna perhaps cueball submitted his own human dna to a dog pedigree company and their method of testing includes a presumption of dog dna and therefore was able to produce this result from cueball's sample or perhaps this comic is a suggestion that some dna test companies are scams that do not even perform dna tests but simply send out arbitrary reports that are not based on any testing
