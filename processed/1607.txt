n in this comic blondie as a news anchor presents a breaking news story about the supreme court of the united states scotus the highest judicial body in the united states its decisions as expressed in the judicial opinions of its justices are often in the news as in this comic however the supreme court has only nine members thus a ruling that passed 9 1 for a total of 10 votes would indicate that a man claiming to be an additional justice has somehow infiltrated the court the other nine justices are aware of the non justice and make it clear that this tenth justice does not belong it is unclear if the justices released a formal decision on the subject or if the news is merely reporting the judges' statements as if they were decisions by citing a 9 1 decision decisions of the scotus are made on the basis of the opinion of the majority of the justices the identity of the tenth justice is not revealed in the comic or apparently to the actual justices and neither is the reason that the interloper's vote was counted presumably the nine actual justices voted that the tenth didn't belong while the interloper himself voted the other way this comic may be motivated by a 2012 survey commonly cited since that two thirds of americans cannot name a supreme court justice and general ignorance of americans overall of their own political landscape by implying that even justices are not confident in the identity of other members the title text refers to justice kennedy's reputation for being a moderate who is usually the swing vote in 5 4 decisions which means that his vote can decide the outcome of the case which is otherwise split along the political leanings of the other justices the joke in the title text is that he is weighing the arguments of both sides even though the non justice is clearly not a justice and would not be allowed to make an argument if he were the fictional kennedy is committing the golden mean fallacy also seen in 690 semicontrolled demolition and makes the same jab at that fallacy sometimes the views of the two sides are mutually exclusive or the other side is just wrong there is a second joke in the title text that the man is claiming to be two of the current justices who would actually have been in the room at the same time as the impostor was claiming to be them to add further absurdity to this one of those justices the man was claiming to be was justice ginsburg who is female that said it is possible that this could refer to a point in time in the past under the tenth circuit act of 1863 the us supreme court was expanded to 10 justices; stephen johnson field was named to the 10th seat congress abolished the seat via attrition through the judicial circuits act of 1866 field remained in office until 1897
