n this comic has three layers hacking philosophy and google satire it starts off on a practical level with black hat describing to cueball a devious social engineering scheme it relies on the fact that people commonly reuse the same password on multiple websites and tend to create accounts on new websites somewhat indiscriminately thus one could create a simple web service to collect users' usernames email addresses and passwords since many users will reuse this combination on other websites as well the website owner can try to hack their accounts on other common sites such as amazon paypal or even people's banks using the same login information in panel 7 the comic suddenly develops a philosophical and ethical bent black hat reveals that he has already carried out step 1 through his numerous unprofitable web services which he had been running for this very purpose however after successfully executing the hack he realizes that he does not know what to do with all this power he reveals that he is already financially self sufficient and makes a point that money can't buy happiness once past that point he even states that research has proven this he could use his power to realize his sadistic pleasures of messing with people but he's already a serial classhole and do not need these information to continue that trend  if he had any beliefs or ideology he could use this power to try to spread them however he reveals that since march of 1997 he doesn't really believe in anything this could possibly refer to the march 26 1997 incident in san diego california where 39 heaven's gate cultists committed mass suicide at their compound it is a plausible explanation since one of them was the brother of nichelle nichols a star trek actress so the event got a big resonance in nerd circles and randall often refers to star trek in xkcd however given black hat's strange behavior it could be anything even bill clinton banning federal funding for human cloning research maybe he will finally find a belief he wish to spread after his revelation in 1717 pyramid honey the dilemma black hat has cleverly executed a hack that has given him a lot of power but he doesn't know what to do with it  the last part of the comic now transitions to a satire on how google has already gone through both the stages described above it describes how all of google's free services are simply a ploy to collect and control all the world's information similar in concept but grander than the hack described in part 1 it satirizes the notion that behind google's don't be evil motto is actually an end goal of using their powers eventually for evil  however just like black hat once google reaches the stage where they are able to capitalize on their powers the cueball like head executive finds that there is nothing evil left for them to desire except as hairbun states make even more money as they already make a lot of money this ploy is moot and anything remaining that they wish to do such as hosting call of duty cod tournaments isn't evil at all  in the end the secretary calls dibs on the tv in the lobby in order to play cod4 on what one can assume is a large screen the cueball like executive who wished to implement the evil plan in the first place facepalms when he realizes that google just sucks at being evil this comic was directly referenced in the title text of 1286 encryptic
