n a common sight in workplaces is a sign reading 'xx days since event' or 'xx days without event' where xx is a two digit number indicated using flip cards so it may be easily changed and event is some undesirable preventable occurrence the purpose of such signs is to inspire employees by proudly displaying how long the event has been avoided or prevented the most common version of such signs used in industrial workplaces displays the number of days since the last workplace accident or injury in the comic the sign says 38 days since the last time someone reset this sign the term 'reset' is the crux because while computer minded people tend to interpret it as 'reboot' or 'set to zero' it also means re set with the meaning 'set again' see definition  we will call  reset ~ set to zero &gt; meaning 1 reset ~ set again &gt;  meaning 2 because the sign uses manual flip cards one cannot add days to the counter without resetting meaning 2 the sign which creates a paradox  either you add a day by resetting meaning 2 it which according to the sign means you'd have to reset meaning 1 the sign or you don't in which case the value on the sign would not be valid the value of the sign cannot be true for more than one day the value of the sign in the comic 38 can only be true if someone flipped the cards 38 day ago  the sign is self referential which causes the paradox self reference is frequently used in xkcd for example 33 self reference and 688self description if you only use meaning 1 the sign can be seen as a challenge/invitation reactance the title text refers to the signs sometimes hung over roadways in front of bridges which display the clearance of the bridge for the benefit of tall vehicles however this one displays only its own clearance a number which would be unimportant if the sign itself were not there
