n this comic is exaggerating the effects of the physics stated solar flares eject among other things ions electrons and radiation the charged particles reach earth after a day or two and in history has knocked the power out in some areas during a large flare they can marginally affect the magnetic field of earth or dent it as cueball says a voltage occurs in a conductor the wire when subjected to a changing magnetic field however this change is small and influences very long conductors such as telephone lines interestingly phenomena as described by cueball have occurred several times in recorded history with effects quite nearly like those described most notably the carrington event of 1859 in 1859 a solar storm produced a series of powerful geomagnetic storms across the world and many telegraph operators reported electrical phenomena electric shock from the apparatus messages sent and received despite disconnect from power sources and pylons carrying telegraph lines sparking and arcing with current all across north america for this to occur in shorter conductors eg beret guy's extension cord a solar storm would have to be so destructively large as to pose far more danger than just fires the chances of such a solar event occurring again are not prohibitively small though quite infrequent and the last one of comparative size and strength was recorded in 2012 mythbusters is a show which tests urban legends or myths that viewers submit they have a classic style of scaling up myths to comical sizes by starting the myth that a fire would be formed from the large voltage across the wire induced by the earth's magnetic field cueball hopes to see it tested on mythbusters and perhaps then scaled up to astronomical proportions this comic may also reference how mythbusters is running out of urban legends to test and has resorted to testing the feasibility of viral videos movie scenes proverbs and the like plus occasionally making up urban legends the title text refers to the large hadron collider lhc the most powerful particle collider in the world and the fear of some people of the production of stable microscopic black holes destroying the earth of course testing something like this would be outside the scope of a show like mythbusters&#91;citation needed&#93;
