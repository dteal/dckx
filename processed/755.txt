n an interdisciplinary program is a program at a school or university that involves students from multiple disciplines or fields of study here this comics lampoons the concept by envisioning an oddball exercise involving physics students and psychology students strictly speaking this could be categorized as an interdisciplinary program further the study of pendulums is common in physics courses and the concept of fear arises in psychology thus the joint effort can be supposedly said to unify both subjects the intersection of physics and psychology suggests the classic demonstration in which someone holds a heavy pendulum up against his face and releases it basic physics shows that the pendulum will at most harmlessly touch the person's face on the backswing provided that he released it with no initial push and does not lean forward; however it may take some force of will to refrain from flinching as the pendulum approaches this experiment with black hat's twisted take is referenced in 1670 laws of physics in another example where the two concepts meet the pendulum like motion of objects such as a gold pocketwatch on a chain is stereotypically used in portals of psychology as a device for hypnotism the ripping of psychology history and english majors is a common theme in various xkcd comics the image text suggests that replacing the pendulums with history students would guarantee funding of a grant perhaps because of the increased number of disciplines involved in reality it of course serves to increase injuries among students in majors that the author does not approve of interestingly this is apparently being said by the grant funders rather than the professor
