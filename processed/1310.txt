n in mathematics a pair of related conjectures may be described as strong and weak or often a normal statement and a weak one a strong conjecture if true can be used to easily prove the weaker one but not vice versa ie if the weak statement is true that alone isn't enough to prove that the strong one is also true conversely if the weak conjecture is false that is enough to prove the stronger one false as well but not vice versa weak conjectures are often easier to prove than related strong ones goldbach's weak and strong conjectures are a pair of real unsolved problems relating to prime numbers a number with exactly two positive divisors 1 and itself the comic states these under the labels weak and strong   goldbach's weak conjecture says that every odd number above 5 can be written as the sum of three prime numbers a computer aided proof of this was completed in 2013 but it is not yet clear whether the proof has been accepted as correct  goldbach's strong conjecture more often simply goldbach's conjecture says that every even number above 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers if true this would automatically make the weak conjecture true as well because every odd number above 5 can be written as an even number above 2 equal to two primes plus 3 the third prime  randall's further conjectures extend this to a whole series of progressively weaker and stronger statements his weak conjectures are so weak that they are obviously true; his strong conjectures are so restrictive that they are obviously false however for the most part they really do maintain the weak strong relationship   the very strong conjecture says that every odd number is prime this is false but if it were true it would make goldbach's strong conjecture true as well because every even number can be written as the sum of two odd numbers which by this conjecture are prime  the extremely strong conjecture says that numbers stop at 7 this is of course false but if it were true it might make the above conjecture true as well 9 is the first odd composite number so stopping at 7 would eliminate all odd composite numbers 1 is neither prime nor composite but it has been counted as a prime number in the past randall may have meant 1 to be an unspoken exception or he may be returning to the older definition that included 1 as prime  in the other direction the very weak conjecture says that every number above 7 can be written as the sum of two other numbers this is true but as it says nothing about primes it isn't enough to prove goldbach's weak conjecture the weak conjecture being true would automatically make this one true though if we didn't already know it was true  the extremely weak conjecture says that numbers just keep going this is true but it may not actually be implied by the above conjectures those say that numbers above 7 have certain properties without requiring that such numbers exist this may seem like a nitpicky point but mathematicians love those; also it causes problems because the extremely strong and extremely weak conjectures contradict each other if the other conjectures were rewritten to say these numbers exist and have these properties then they would imply this extremely weak conjecture but then the extremely strong one would have to be stricken off  the title text gives the same treatment to the twin prime conjecture which says that there are infinitely many pairs of primes where one is 2 more than the other eg 3 and 5 the title text adds a weak conjecture according to which there are simply infinitely many pairs of primes with no mention of distance between them this is true; euclid's theorem says that there are an infinite number of primes and so you can simply pick any two eg 5 and 13 and call them a pair it also adds a strong conjecture where every prime is now a twin prime this is easily proven false; for example 23 is prime but 25 is not however randall adds a humorous hedge that some prime numbers may not look prime at first lastly the tautological prime conjecture states that it itself is true while making no statement about primes it is not technically a tautology but more of a plain assertion randall has mentioned tautologies before in 703 honor societies
