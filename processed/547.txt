n there are three cueballs discussing a particle accelerator one cueball asks the others about the tertiary free electron laser fel guidance system as this is a fairly technical topic we would expect a response filled with scientific jargon the joke is that the other cueball instead responds in a much simpler manner he uses simple phrases such as smash the right things together and that would be very bad as the caption below the comic notes cueball and/or randall has spent the previous night reading the simple english wikipedia a simplified version of wikipedia intended to be easier to understand and now he finds himself using similarly simple syntax for example the article for a particle accelerator describes it as a machine that makes really tiny things called particles travel at very high speeds this is similar to the simple response given by the responding cueball in the actual comic cueball was able to effectively communicate the dangers of using a broken fel using simple syntax similar to the style of the simple english wikipedia from the title text randall believes that if people teaching advanced mathematics followed this style their subject would be more accessible the implication is that more people would be drawn to studying mathematics and that naturally the world would be a better place because of this this concept was later revisited in 722 computer problems 1133 up goer five and 1436 orb hammer
