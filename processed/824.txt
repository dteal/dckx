n bill amend author of the newspaper comic foxtrot draws for randall in this special 'guest week' edition of xkcd in the first two panels we see jason fox a geeky 10 year old from amend's strip jason asks to draw comics for randall when randall refuses he uses the sudo command used in posix systems to perform an action as an administrator/super user this forces randall to agree this is a reference to the very popular comic 149 sandwich which has now become a geek culture catch phrase in the first comic cueball is making a pun on the word attractive in the first context it means a person is  good looking or beautiful which the presumably female character attributes to her hair in cueball's context it means that he is feeling an increased gravitational pull from the woman due to her increase in mass see gravitation this setup is also very typical of the jason fox character who ostensibly ten is supposed to be too young to like girls werner heisenberg postulated in 1927 his eponymous heisenberg uncertainty principle which roughly states that in quantum mechanics one cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle the joke is that presumably elisabeth heisenberg does not know the position of her keys because she knows too much about their the keys' momentum this is also the subject of 1473 location sharing in many parliamentary and congressional halls it is customary when calling an issue to vote to have the people who want the issue at hand to be passed to say out loud that they agree the customary response to this is to say aye the dissenters are then asked their response would be nay or no then the volume by rough decibels of the assenters and dissenters are weighed if it is close a more formal vote may be called aye is pronounced as i and i is the mathematical value of the square root of negative one which can be used to represent an imaginary number the title text of this comic draws attention to the fact that there are a number of notable people who have become famous as cartoonists but also hold degrees in physics or have a strong interest in physics this might seem unusual because the average person might see physics and art as incompatible and this is why randall writes an oddly large number these people include   randall munroe the writer of xkcd has a degree in physics from christopher newport university  bill amend the creator of foxtrot majored in physics at amherst college   zach weiner who writes the webcomic saturday morning breakfast cereal majored in physics at san jose state university  henry reich is the creator of the web video series minutephysics and studied physics and mathematics at grinnell college  paul g hewitt is a physicist and author of physics textbooks his textbooks contain a number of cartoons drawn by hewitt himself to help illustrate physics concepts  aaron diaz writes the webcomic dresden codak and majored in physics among several other things before dropping out his comics frequently reference ideas and experiments in physics  larry gonick is a cartoonist who has published a number of educational comic books including the cartoon guide to physics   guest week was a series of five comics written by five other comic authors they were released over five consecutive days monday friday; not over the usual monday/wednesday/friday schedule the five comics are  822 guest week jeph jacques questionable content 823 guest week david troupes buttercup festival 824 guest week bill amend foxtrot 825 guest week jeffrey rowland overcompensating 826 guest week zach weiner smbc
