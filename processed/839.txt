n this comic blends board games such as chess the settlers of catan and battleship with exploration making possible references to space exploration and the age of discovery the typical representation of explorers has them travel from their homeland aboard a ship to unknown distant places the travel can get very long implying the need for food supplies on the ship; and the fact that the crew members have to live together with little room the ship for such a long time with possibilities of failure getting lost or dying for various reasons can often lead to tensions between some of them in the age of exploration the explorers were mainly sailors from europe traveling on the sea to other continents whereas in space exploration they are astronauts or robots from earth traveling in space to other planets or whatever celestial bodies but the general concepts of exploration remain the same here the explorers are two chess pieces a knight and a bishop; they have left their home board presumably a full 8x8 chess board aboard a smaller capsule made of a small 3x3 chess board in motion  it could be drifting in the sea; rolling along a hard surface on wheels or casters as indicated by the small circles by each corner; or flying through space with the circles as rockets  the drawing is somewhat ambiguous  they are apparently headed for a settlers of catan board and already passed near a battleship board so these game boards are like islands or regions which the chess pieces explore coming from a chess board ba3 nc3 and ke5 are the identification of chess pieces and their respective position ba3 is a bishop on the a3 square nc3 a knight on the c3 square and ke5 a king on the e5 square chess is pretty much a representation of the structure of medieval european society with the king and queen being the most crucial pieces the bishops representing the somewhat powerful clergy the knights corresponding to the armies the rook alluding the castles and the pawns being as the medieval working classes the most numerous and disposable assets; so chess pieces exploring other places approaching the coast of catan and reporting to the king calling ke5 is reminiscent of explorers from europe who under their king's jurisdiction set sail to other continents during the age of exploration the explorers are communicating with a mission control which is common in space exploration also an eta is an estimated time of arrival in chess the knight and the bishop have different move constraints the knight can only move two squares horizontally and one square vertically or two vertically and one horizontally so on the capsule the knight explorer can only go from one corner square to a black square or vice versa the bishop can only move diagonally so this bishop is bound to move only on the white squares the knight is also the only piece that can jump over other pieces which seems to annoy the bishop hence the hopping around; apparently the bishop put all the food onto the middle square which the knight can't reach because the knight was taunting him about his not being able to get onto a black square the two pieces are from the opposite chess camps one black and the other white this can be a reference to multinational space mission crews where formerly opponent nations joined their efforts on space missions but in chess it also means they can capture each other by getting on the square where the other stands here with the chess turn by turn gameplay the knight won't be able to capture the bishop except of course in case of error or dumb move since the bishop will always be able to escape whereas the bishop is actually one or two moves away from capturing the knight so saying that he's this close to capturing him is a play on words he is this close as in a few moves away as well as this close as in severely annoyed and about to act on it finally the title text adds two jokes the settlers of catan board has an hexagonal grid which means the chess pieces will have difficulty to move on it since they are used to moving on a squared grid this can draw a parallel with explorers facing in distant lands weather conditions wild animals atmosphere or whatever condition to which they are not used at all in their homeland battleship is a game where players send shots on the opponent's board which is why the chess capsule received shots when it passed within firing range of a battleship board; in pure chess style it's the pawns of the crew the least valuable and most disposable chess pieces who took the shots
