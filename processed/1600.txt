n blondie as a news anchor is reporting on the day's price swings on the stock market it has been noticed that the dow index has traced out the dc skyline marketwatch as written above the skyline is a website focused on stocks the djia as written on the screen is the dow jones industrial average commonly referred to as the dow it is a stock market index meaning that it is a general indicator of how the market is running in this case an aggregate of how 30 major industrial companies are doing the stock market is famous for having unpredictable price swings but for them to specifically make a tracing of a skyline or any recognizable image would definitely weird out most investors the djia has been featured previously in 426 geohashing dc refers to washington dc the dc skyline shown here traces out the lincoln memorial the washington monument an obelisk and the united states capitol which are located in that order in a line down the national mall this this this and some of these photos show the skyline depicted in the comic as seen in 276 fixed width unusual patterns can be addictive to the point of harming those involved in the pattern's creation the joke however rests in the fact that stock investors probably have a lot at stake so following a pattern rather than pursuing gains would be uncharacteristic although some investors follow superstitious behavior such as making trades to follow a pattern rather than make more obvious profits many trades are now made by automated computer systems which may recognize some types of patterns but would not recognize the dc skyline making it impossible for the stock market to continue to follow such a pattern merely because of the efforts of the human traders buying and selling stocks based on patterns in the price charts is a common but controversial method of investing many day traders and some professional investors still use stock patterns head and shoulders trend lines etc to make trades see for instance analyzing chart patterns most professional investors and finance academics believe that this practice is random see strong and weak efficient markets hypothesis in the title text it is noted that the markets again has been shaken by uncertainty for the second day running after the dc skyline incidence from the main comic this time it was because someone at nyse the new york stock exchange had set up a giant ouija board that was controlled by the movement of the stock tickers thus collectively everyone at the nyse as all have some influence on those the ouija is also known as a spirit board a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet the numbers 0xe2x80x939 the words yes no and possibly a few others a movable indicator indicates a spirit's message by spelling it out on the board during a sxc3xa9ance ticker tape was an early way of transmitting stock price and it was run through a stock ticker which printed abbreviated company names as alphabetic symbols followed by numeric stock transaction price and volume information today this has been replaced with electronics but the concept of the stock ticker lives on however in the scrolling electronic tickers seen on brokerage walls and on financial television networks if the stock exchange begins to look to spirit boards people will get worried also maybe by the cryptic messages from beyond they are receiving via the stock ticker explaining the uncertainty of course some people might claim that this is not so far from how stock brokers decide what to do anywayxe2x80xa6 the general idea of manipulating the djia for goals unrelated to financial gains reminds of the geohashing bill gates achievement the washington monument was also part of the game in 1608 hoverboard just left of the starting area
