n       this explanation may be incomplete or incorrect more on the two entries in the comic especially the i/e note is this true generally or was it for the sound in reductionsm like in riductionsm is this a reference to the great vowel shiftif you can address this issue please edit the page thanks reductionism is an approach that seeks to understand the world by breaking problems into simpler pieces this approach can disregard emergent properties which appear only from the individual parts working together  in this comic randall shows the first part of a dictionary entry on the word reductionism in a real dictionary like dictionarycom an entry with similar build up looks like this  reductionism  noun  1 the theory that every complex phenomenon especially in biology or psychology can be explained by analyzing the simplest most basic physical mechanisms that are in operation during the phenomenon 2 the practice of simplifying a complex idea issue condition or the like especially to the point of minimizing obscuring or distorting it  in the comic the n refers to noun and the 1 indicate that this is the first of more than one entries about the word the meta joke is that randall is attempting to define the word reductionism by taking the reductionist approach to its extreme he thus breaks the word into its 12 individual letters explaining the origin of each individual letter acting as if the word was nothing more than the sum of all its letters in doing so he entirely fails to explain the actual meaning of the word the entire entry number 1 could in principle have 12 phrases one for each of the letters r e d u c t i o n i s and m but here only the first two for r and e are included the third d only just starts when the entry is cut off at the bottom of the panel it could be argued that the two i's could share one explanation but as a reductionist you might not even notice that the i had already been explained as it happens every letter of the latin alphabet the writing system used by the english language and many other languages is ultimately derived from egyptian hieroglyphics not just r but maybe the same sentence is used for all the consonants as the only word in the explanation for d is is; the same that starts the explanation for r the second letter that is explained is e a vowel in modern english spelling the letter e is used xe2x80x93 alone or in combination xe2x80x93 to represent a number of different vowel sounds compare gene bed crepe in the word reductionism the e can be pronounced as /xc9xaa/ riductionism /ixcbx90/ reeductionism or /xc9x99/ ruductionism depending on dialect and emphasis but the comic is talking about the sound used to pronounce the letter itself /ixcbx90/ long e it explains that this vowel sound was normally represented with the letter i until the 1500's this is a reference to the great vowel shift a change in the pronunciation of many english vowels around that time before then a word like see was pronounced /sexcbx90/ approximately seh with no diphthong while a word like bite was pronounced /bixcbx90t/ beet so in modern english pronunciation the long e sound is the same as what the long i spelling used to represent in the title text two people are speaking the first speaker has noticed that physics people can be a little on the reductionist side randall would consider himself a physicist the presumed physicist then says that it is a ridiculous notion he challenges the other to name one reductionist word i've ever said but by claiming he is not a reductionist by focusing on the individual words which even/especially in the case of reductionist are never used solely by reductionists he is asking for an impossible comparison to be made when proof of reductionism is clearly an emergent property of a fuller sentences if not whole discourses by insisting on focusing only upon individual words in this manner the speaker likely proves themself a reductionist in the very act of trying to refute this accusation reductionism has previously appeared deep down in 1416 pixels
