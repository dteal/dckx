n the solid line represents the theoretical radiation for a blackbody at 273 k according to planck's law derived as early as 1900 by max planck the formula almost as written in the graph can be found here the only changes are that on wikipedia the frequency f is represented by the greek letter xcexbd nu and the temperature t is included as an independent variable so if becomes ivt however ivt still represents the spectral radiance similar to energy density in this formula h is the planck constant c is the speed of light in a vacuum and k is the boltzmann constant the frequency f or v along the x axis is measured in ghz giga or billion herz the curve peaks at 1604&#160;ghz there is no scale or unit on the energy density on the y axis the theory is that the blackbody in question was in fact the universe at the point when it had cooled down enough to allow photons to escape 038 billion years into the universe's 138 billion years history the photons that reach us today are the ones that have been travelling to us at lightspeed since then as the light from astronomical objects suffers from redshift due to the expansion of the universe and this shift becomes more pronounced with distance from the observer this light displays in the infrared range the title text praises viewers who can identify where this equation and corresponding graph come from without consulting this wiki of course
