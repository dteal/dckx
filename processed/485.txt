n the comic is a companion piece to 482 height which explored a logarithmic scale from the edge of the observable universe down to the earth's surface depth continues the process viewing logarithmically smaller scales from earth's atmosphere down to the interior of a single proton this combination is reminiscent of charles and ray eames' 1977 short film powers of ten here's a walk through the entire comic   at the top we see a cutaway view of a story apartment complex from left to right are a reference to 150 grownups megan exorcising windows vista ponytail and megan playing guitar hero or a similar game cueball at a desk and what appear to be some sexytimes  the view descends into cueball's tower pc  entering the computer's internals we see a mouse plugged into the ps/2 6 pin mini din connector this is a visual pun since the mouse is an actual rodent and not a handheld device  next we dive into the cpu we see a multi layered pun on the question how many angels can dance on the head of a pin there may be a pun with a chip's connector pin but the more obvious reference is randall's answer of 32767 = 215 1 the largest possible value of a signed 16 bit integer adding one rolls back over to32768 which is 32768 devils or negative angels see 571 can't sleep for a similar joke and a more elaborate explanation  a blood sucking mosquito appears to be leeching a torrent  a segfault is a problem with memory access  we zoom into a memory unit on the cpu cueball is being rickrolled as indicated by the label pixel on rick astley's shoulder  a fork; command points at one of several unlabeled spermatazoa forking and sperm are capable of spawning child processes  peter norton is the founder of norton antivirus he is shown fighting a biological virus rather than informatic malware  showing the relative scale of carbon nanotubes the suggestion is that these then lead on to a more megastructural space elevator for which carbon nanotubes are often cited as a suitably strong component needed for the cable  we soon zoom into a silicon atom in the cpu in the electron cloud the squiggles made out of arrows are feynman diagrams a feynman diagram in the shape of a stick figure is saying sup a pun on the sup particle supersymmetric partner 'squark' to the up quark and an abbreviation of the greeting what's up  an 'ipod femto' is shown as a pun on the 'ipod nano' both are si prefixes both of which refer to units far smaller than any ipod that has ever or likely will ever be created  brian greene is a theoretical physicist and pop scientist who discusses the nature of the universe the picture of him knitting is a pun on string theory and pbs miniseries the fabric of the cosmos  the planck length xe2x84x93p is the smallest theoretically measurable distance defined by three fundamental constants in physics the speed of light in a vacuum c planck's constant h and the gravitational constant g the planck length is vastly smaller than any known particle that isn't a point mass and modern physics is a long way from being able investigate such a scale  1162 log scale and 482 height are other comics about the use of log scales
