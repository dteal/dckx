n the comic gives examples of four non functional sorting algorithms written in pseudo python the first sort is an unfinished merge sort the merge sort works recursively by dividing a list in half and performing a merge sort to each half after the two halves are sorted they are merged taking advantage of the fact that the two halves are now in correct order and thus the merge can be done efficiently the author of the merge sort in the comic appears to have given up on writing the sorted merge part of the sort which is why it's a half hearted merge sort but instead concatenates the halves without sorting in its current state the sort would divide the list into elements of size one then recombine them in their original unsorted order but in nested lists making the original data more difficult to work with the author acknowledges this failing with the comment ummmmm here sorry the second sort is an optimized variant of bogosort a standard bogosort works by randomly shuffling the elements in the list until they are sorted in a comment the author points out that this variant of bogosort runs in on logn whereas standard bogosorts actually run in expected onxc2xb7n time but may never finish this variant of bogosort finishes so much faster because in most cases it does not actually sort the list instead reporting a fictitious error in the operating system a kernel page fault if the list isn't ordered after shuffling logn times  the bogosort is optimized because no comparison sort algorithm can possibly do better than on logn in the worst case the third sort parodies a programmer explaining a quicksort during a job interview the quicksort works by choosing an index as a pivot value and sorting all elements less than the pivot before the pivot and all the elements greater than the pivot after the pivot it then does a quicksort to the section less than the pivot and the section greater than the pivot until the whole list is sorted the interviewee flounders for a little while then asks whether they can use the standard libraries to call a quicksort using the standard library's quicksort would allow the programmer to successfully execute a quicksort but would not demonstrate that they understand how it works the final sort is just a mess first it checks to see if the list is sorted and exits if it is then it rotates the list by a random amount 10000 times as if cutting a deck of cards and exits if the list is ever sorted next in desperation it checks if the list is sorted three times finally realizing that they have no chance of success the author performs the computer equivalent of a rage quit and attempts to destroy the computer rather than admit defeat first the program attempts to schedule a shutdown of the computer in five seconds then attempts to delete the current directory then attempts to delete the user's home directory presumably the grader's files and finally all the files on the computer rm is a posix command; ther andf flags mean that the remove command will remove all contents of the specified directories and will not prompt the user beforehand under the guise of portability the program runs the equivalent windows rd command with switches to delete all files from the c drive without prompting finally the program returns a list containing the numbers one through five in order in the title text stackoverflow link is a question and answer site where programmers can ask and answer questions on programming the author of this code takes advantage of the hopes that someone on stackoverflow knows what they are doing and has posted code to sort a list and somebody implemented stacksort; well sort of
