n for those not familiar this comic is a play on the classic question guys ask women where drapes=head hair and carpet=pubic hair the assumption is that some people artificially dye their head hair but typically would not dye other body hair the question is essentially asking are you a 'natural' red head/blonde/etc the classic question doesn't mention upholstery hence cueball's confusion there is some speculation about other body/arm/leg/arm pit hair interpretations for upholstery this comic could also be a self referential joke where the furniture is a double entendre to the art of the comic itself the carpet is the white background of the comic which matches the black drapes of cueball the woman and the words the upholstery in this case is the woman's hair which is colored and heavily bordered to create a 3d effect which does not at all match the rest of this comic the fact that cueball seems confused as per the last panel and title text suggests the fourth wall may have been broken
