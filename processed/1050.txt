n megan standing with hairy is an ext student of miss lenhart and she taunts her old algebra teacher because she hasn't used algebra since she left school this is a reflection of a common gripe among students that they have no need to learn math because they assume they'll never use it after they graduate randall's argument is that you have the option to use what you learned in school or not lots of people use math after they graduate lots of people use their music lessons and others don't use anything they learned in school at all however randall doesn't understand why someone would be proud of their own ignorance especially since people do brag about things like being able to cook and speak other languages which are also technically non essential however megan is also wrong in that she likely does use basic mathematical calculations in everyday life even if they're not in orderly lists of parameters ending with solve for x for example to turn one's apartment into a ball pit like in  150 grownups one must calculate or at least estimate another skill learned in math class the floor space of the room the desired depth for the balls to cover the space occupied by one crate of balls and the cost of such a crate while the operations are basic arithmetic the ability to recognize unknowns and sort them into a meaningful statement comes from algebra the title text states that technically you don't need to do anything but survive and pay your taxes although ironically doing one's taxes can require quite a bit of algebra and implies that math is one of the optional and fun parts of life this is one of the two comics where miss lenhart is both drawn and named the first being 499 scantron
