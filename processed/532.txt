n the joke here is the reverse of an old joke that appeared in rechumorfunny in the original the punchline reveals that a small pianist is the result of a man's wish for a twelve inch one foot or 305 cm penis which was misheard by a genie in this version cueball wished for the twelve inch pianist to a hard of hearing genie with the implication that he instead received a twelve inch penis this piques megan's interest a long debated subject in human sexuality is whether sexual activity is more pleasurable for a woman when the man has a larger penis and therefore whether woman desire men with larger penises although opinions on the subject seem to vary in surveys a common stereotype is that women prefer or even seek out men with large penises or at very least are turned off by men with small penises penis size has become associated with virility and manliness and another common generalization is that men would choose to have the largest penis if it were possible to choose the punchline of the original joke plays on the fact that wishing for a tiny pianist is a very unusual interesting and specific wish until the punchline reveals that the subject's wish was far more expected the title text is implying that since cueball's wish was misheard as referencing penis size had the piano been even smaller it would have only needed a three inch 76 cm pianist this would imply that cueball's misheard wish would have resulted in his being given a three inch penis which is below average and therefore following the same generalizations as above is seen as undesirably small genies or magic lamps are mentioned in at least three other comics  152 hamster ball 879 lamp where randall also manages to make a penis related joke 1391 darkness
