n punch buggy is a game played by two people with a view of traffic often but not here during a car ride for each volkswagen beetle that passes nearby the first player to see it is entitled to punch the other player while calling punch buggy followed by the colour of the spotted beetle traditionally the other player is permitted to return the punch unless the first player also calls no punch back many people will just assume that the game is always being played and punch you out of the blue giving you no chance to opt out implicit in this game is the idea that you can make rules just by declaring them eg no punch back even if those rules are ridiculously unfair when cueball realizes this he decides to make the game stakes more desirable than just the right to punch someone and seemingly successfully uses the same principle to secure the right to sleep with the other man's girlfriend the title text describes how silly these games are in the uk a common variant uses a yellow mini rather than the vw beetle other examples of this type of game are the car numberplate game and padiddle
