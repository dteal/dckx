n for some modern songs the vocalist chooses to perform the track in a way that emphasizes emotion accent or style over clear pronunciation of the lyrics some forms of music for example the jazz style scat use purely nonsensical lyrics while some styles of dance music use a single line of lyrics repeated throughout the track there are also certain types of people that may describe themselves as lyric deaf which is sort of the lyrical equivalent to being tone deaf although it doesn't have an underlying medical understanding some people that describe themselves as tone deaf are even quite musically capable the comic is illustrating in text form how listening to such a song feels before you have learned what the actual lyrics are the lyrics are represented in an indecipherable way with a few mildly recognizable words this represents the auditory experience of being able to hear and understand some words perhaps incorrectly but not all of them another example of this experience can be seen in this british tv commercial from the 1980s showing someone who has misheard desmond dekker song israelites so for instance the line poor me israelites becomes oh oh my ears are alight see more details in the trivia section this experience is similar to that shown by the character havelock vetinari the patrician of ankh morpork in terry pratchett's discworld book soul music see part of book here rather than listening to music he preferred to read the printed sheet music  in fact the kind of music he really liked was the kind that never got played it ruined music in his opinion to torment it by involving it on dried skins bits of dead cat and lumps of metal hammered into wires and tubes it ought to stay written down on the page in rows of little dots and crotchets all neatly caught between lines only there was it pure it was when people started doing things with it that the rot set in much better to sit quietly in a room and read the sheets with nothing between yourself and the mind of the composer but a scribble of ink having it played by sweaty fat men and people with hair in their ears and spit dribbling out of the end of their oboe well the idea made him shudder  for a related experience see mondegreen the title text elaborates on the fact that randall has the same experience when trying to understand song lyrics as when he sees text in his dreams the last part of the title text is written in strange scripts to illustrate how he feels when seeing text in his dreams translated it says it's hard to read and i can't focus note that it looks like the song lyrics were written by drawing in a tool like ms paint and then cutting out pieces and shifting them slightly
