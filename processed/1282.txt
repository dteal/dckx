n this comic is a reference to the monty hall problem a probability puzzle based on the us game show let's make a deal and named after its original host monty hall the premise of the show was that hall would offer deals to contestants pulled from the audience in which they could win cash and prizes some deals involved games/tasks the contestant had to perform while others simply involved the contestant making choices between a series of doors or boxes in such games of choice there were often several prizes and typically at least one zonk the show's name for an undesirable gag prize which on the original monty hall version of the show were frequently animals such as goats in the classic version of the monty problem a contestant is offered a choice of three doors behind two of the doors are goats and behind one of them is a car first the contestant chooses a door which remains closed the host then opens one of the two remaining doors and reveals a goat the contestant is then offered a final choice of whether to switch their choice to the remaining closed door or keep the door they originally chose the problem involves an analysis of the probability of the contestant choosing the car given certain circumstances the problem assumes that a contestant would want to win a car and would be disappointed to win a goat which most contestants would have no ability to house and no use for the comic shows that beret guy upon the host revealing that door b has a goat behind it chooses to take the goat to keep as a pet which makes them both very happy this is much like and may be an allusion to the simpsons episode bart gets an elephant in which bart opts for the gag prize of an african elephant rather than the $10000 award the title text references the car and the remaining goat untouched behind the remaining doors
