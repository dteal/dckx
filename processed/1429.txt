n kirk vs picard is a debate that many star trek fans engage in xe2x80x94 specifically which was a better captain of the starship enterprise on the tv show captain james t kirk and jean luc picard each were captains of the ship in different periods kirk was captain of uss enterprise ncc 1701 in the original series while picard was captain of uss enterprise d ncc 1701 d in the next generation but fans argue over who was the best most third place candidates are pretty distant resulting in a more multi faceted debate cueball seems to be looking at results of polling for this third most popular character the humor in this comic stems from the fact that the latin word data is a plural form of the word datum and that originally english followed latin's lead and treated data as plural however in more recent english usage of datum has faded to the extent that data is treated as a collective noun this usage is becoming increasingly but not universally accepted as grammatically correct xe2x80x94 the wall street journal for instance recently announced that it is moving away from saying data are while the new york times' manual of style allows for both variants depending on usage scenario; usa today however is consistently using data as a plural data are naturally the purists insist on the form that is correct from the latin grammar point of view and see data is as an example of a subject verb agreement error this type of error is present in the beginning of the sentence that cueball is citing according to this polling data while certain traditionalists would hold that the grammatically correct variant would be according to these polling data the second error in the same sentence is due to the fact that data is a character from star trek the next generation since it is a character's name when used to refer to the character data should always be treated as singular by reversing the verb agreement in both cases cueball is going out of his way to annoy grammatically obsessed people the title text suggests the mocking of language pedants/amateur grammar nazis by hypercorrecting one's use of language the sentence itself is an example of this  the general rule is that words starting with a consonant should be preceded by a while words starting with a vowel should be preceded by an however the letter h is a special case since in words like honor /xcbx88xc9x92nxc9x99xc9xb9/ and hour /xcbx88axcax8axc9x99xc9xb9/ the h is silent so the words actually start with a vowel sound thus leading to the use of an  beyond this there is a longstanding controversy over whether to use a or an with words that in some accents start with a silent h and in others they don't see straightdope the oxford learner's dictionary says about historical some speakers do not pronounce the xe2x80x98hxe2x80x99 at the beginning of historical and use xe2x80x98anxe2x80x99 instead of xe2x80x98axe2x80x99 before it this now sounds old fashioned in the title text randall adds the word hypercorrection to the list that includes historical and history in this invented accent the pronunciation would be ypercorrection  this comic complements two of the my hobbies comics 326 effect an effect which discusses the trolling of amateur grammar nazis and 1405 meteor which mocks pedantry this comic could also just as well have been labelled as one of randall's hobbies this comic also appears to be an example of self irony as the author himself has previously exhibited certain inclination to insist on grammatically strict mode of usage of words loaned from latin one such example is the fact that xkcd's online discussion forums are called fora which is a correct plural nominative form of forum in latin
