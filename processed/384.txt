n this comic is multi layered and seems to be randall's take on the fermi paradox for starters the drake equation is a model developed by and named for frank drake an american astrophysicist for estimating the number of communicating life forms in our galaxy even if there is life on other planets most life forms will not establish civilizations however if there are any communicating civilizations their messages would have to travel for hundreds thousands or hundreds of thousands of years to reach us and then our response would take an equivalent amount of time leaving them waiting for thousands and thousands of years or more and probably even more than that any response from their perspective would take at least twice as long as the message took to reach its destination all the factors involved in the equation are difficult to measure or estimate no number is determined with sufficient accuracy so the equation is a guideline for a thought experiment at best and just bullshit at worst the title text makes fun of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence seti project which was founded by frank drake about the searches for intelligent life on other planets by looking for radio communications and the intelligence of their researchers nearly nothing if not nothing restricts potential extraterrestrial communications to the frequencies that seti searches at any given moment even if another civilization communicated on one of seti's search frequencies they would most likely live extremely far away additionally an extraterrestrial source that doesn't know we're here would have to send a constant and powerful signal in all directions for us to notice it this serves to show how ludicrous it may seem to assume any intelligent species is wasting too many resources trying to communicate with us or any other species in the galaxy the seti project is searching at the 21 cm hydrogen line which although considered a favorable frequency by potential extraterrestrial civilizations is not used by humans therefore a seti like organization would have a hard time finding earth the title text suggests randall does not think drake is a nutjob; he just has a more conservative expectation of discovering extraterrestrial life 638 the search further discusses the difficulty of methods of finding extraterrestrial life
