n if all your friends jumped off a bridge would you jump too this is a common question used to challenge a decision based on the bandwagon effect it challenges someone to consider whether something is really a good idea even if everyone else does it in this case friends the sentence is upon closer analysis a straw man attack that over extrapolates the bandwagon effect cueball responds by assuming that if all of his friends jumped off a bridge there must have been some extreme circumstance that made it logical to do so; for example that the bridge is on fire this points out a logical fallacy with the question if they really are jumping off a bridge they're probably motivated by something serious as opposed to an idiotic risk so the humor of this comic is in all the different ways the question can be turned on its head and made to mean something the unseen speaker probably never intended the title text suggests that even if there is nothing wrong with the bridge the person asking the question is not acting right the proper reaction would be concern about the mental or physical they could be injured state of the people jumping off for no valid reason and not just brushing them off as unworthy of attention this is so especially when these people are described as all my friends so they have presumably always behaved correctly until they decided to jump off the bridge
