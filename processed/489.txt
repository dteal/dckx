n google maps is a service to let people look at the world through their web browser when google maps was first starting out the maximum zoom level a person could select went past the highest resolution imagery available in certain areas when this happened google maps would tile the message we're sorry but we don't have imagery at this zoom level when cueball looks closely enough into megan's eyes he sees this same message the title text refers to a functionality of google maps that allows users to submit/update information about places on the map such as business listings monuments etc such updates must be approved by google before other users can see them apparently cueball has been repeatedly submitting 'where you broke my heart' as a listing for his own house so that megan who is now on the google maps team will see those submissions
