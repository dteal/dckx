n megan has been haunted by a timeghost for some time it is obviously not the first time the ghost arrives to let megan know that ooooooooooooo tiiiime is passiiiing the ghost is dedicated to making people feel old by having them think about the passage of time it is shown to reference time periods related to well known people and events such as famous actors and the release of movies and tv shows megan is just annoyed that it is back and wishes it to go away but then when cueball ask how long has it been doing this the ghost suddenly predicts that megan and cueball will die in a shorter amount of time than the time that has passed since the ghost began its hauntings this disturbs megan who stops her complaining and asks what this is not the first time she has been haunted by the ghost but it has probably not been that long so this is a very scary thought to her and cueball we do however not know how long the ghost has been haunting megan also the staaaaart of my haunting may refer to the first time the ghost haunted anyone not just megan this could be a long time ago and thus be true for anyone it meets today or it could mean since the start of this particular manifestation meaning their deaths are imminent it is also possible timeghost is being deliberately ambiguous in an effort to frighten them even more this is of course only scary if you believe the ghost can predict the future which is not what it has been doing so far there is no example in the comic where it makes a prediction that we know is accurate only comparing time spans we can look up see below but one thing about the prediction is true they will eventually die and this is the scary part about realizing how old you are and that you are quickly getting older you will die and soon for some value thereof the comic seems to be using factoid to mean a small fact factoid can also mean a questionable or spurious statement presented as a fact but this does not seem to be intended usage here in this instance some of the factoids are easily verifiable while others are reasonable assumptions based on the number of years passed since the individual events several sources advocate the use of the word factlet to express a brief interesting fact while using the word factoid for unverifiable or untrue statements passed as fact while factoids tend only to have mostly only entertainment value the last fact from the ghost is a prediction of the future megan and cueball's death which is actually of some practical value if it can be trusted timeghost might be a literal interpretation of zeitgeist which is a german term for spirit of time and refers to the school of thought that influences or dominates the art and culture of a time period all the events and people mentioned in this comic may be considered influences on present day art and culture in the title text megan calls ghostbusters from the 1984 movie to help get rid of the timeghost this of course makes the ghost state that people born years after that movie came out are having a second chiiiild right now making her feel old once more randall has covered making people feel old several times in 647 scary 891 movie ages 973 mtv generation in which white hat utters cueball's that can't be right line and 1477 star wars also see the blag post odd temporal milestones this is however so far the only one that makes a prediction of anyone's death a similar ghost with a much different agenda was seen in 1108 cautionary ghost similarly annoying factoids were given in 1272 shadowfacts timeline    year event   1955 1975 vietnam war   19 years   1994 forrest gump   20 years   2014 year of this comic      1964 keanu reeves actor born   2 years   1966 today's new grandparents born average age 48 in the us   48 years   2014 year of this comic      1990 today's new parents born average age 24 in the us   3 years   1993 1994 the simpsons season 5   2 years from '93 to '95   1994 1995 the simpsons season 6   4 years   1999 eminem rapper got big second album   15 years   2014 year of this comic      1984 ghostbusters   3 years   1987 today's people just having a second child born average age at first childbirth 24 + average gap between first two births 3   27 years   2014 year of this comic
