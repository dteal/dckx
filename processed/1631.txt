n the comic starts a small flow chart with this seems to be taking longer than usual it then presents two alternative continuations of the sentence which radically alter the interpretation of the starting sentence resulting in humor this seems to be taking longer than usual is an error message displayed by gmail see here and other software for example disqus see here we realize the allusion to gmail by the first continuation try reloading gmail if the problem persists in the second continuation maybe we should just go to bed the opening instead refers to a person suffering from sexual performance anxiety taking longer than usual to achieve either orgasm or erection probably despite considerable efforts of their partner often such frustration then becomes a self fulfilling prophecy that renders orgasm/erection virtually impossible by ruining the mood in such situations it is likely that one or the other partner becomes frustrated and gives up suggesting let's go to bed instead of 'pointlessly' continuing the sexual activity the title text ties both interpretations together by referencing an infamous error message given by the firefox internet browser as an error message it fits nicely with the gmail interpretation of the comic though it is equally likely to be used as an apology or frustrated slight in the sexual interpretation it would be a likely next line after this is taking longer than usual alternatively it would be embarrassing to get the two responses confused thus necessitating a flowchart as a guide it could also simply be a jab to people who stay online late even when doing nothing as when a lag occurs and finally realising it might be better to switch off the computer and go to bed; or people who stay up late obsessed that someone is wrong on the internet this is not the first time randall juxtaposes sex and more abstract topics such as sex and math in 487 numerical sex positions or sex and engineering in 592 drama
