n this comic refers to how in some countries including the us words or instructions written on the highway are always backwards from how you would read them it seems that the highway engineers write the words as if you would read them as your car goes over them sometimes this approach works other times probably most of the time it is terribly confusing the sentence on the comic is highway engineers think i read backward adding the period is a perfectly hilarious touch as there are probably not too many periods on the highways the title text is referring to how the words of the opening sequence of star wars episode iv a new hope released in 1977 move from the bottom of the screen to the top so that it can be read by a normal human being however the image text says the engineers initially reversed the text because people were driving backwards down the highway trying to re enact the opening sequence so they started reversing the word order to get people to drive the correct direction the title of the comic ahead stop is also a reference to this phenomenon because the common stop ahead instruction would be written on the highway as ahead and then stop this could also be a reference to top posting in email threads and online discussion forums as summarized in the following comedic signature line  a because it messes up the order in which people normally read text q why is top posting such a bad thing a top posting q what is the most annoying thing in e mail
