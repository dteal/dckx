n this strip is a comparison about the time spent in 11th&#160;grade doing various things and how important those things are to one's future the first two bars on the chart are 900 hours of class which is about 180&#160;hours short of how many hours kids spend in school each year most likely to show the lunch hour and 400&#160;hours of homework or an average of about 22&#160;hours per school day conversely idly messing around in perl a programming language for only one weekend is shown to have a much larger impact on one's future xe2x80x94 specifically randall's as learning how to code would have been key to his job as a robotics engineer at nasa this is likely due to the skills one can pick up in even just a single weekend in contrast to the often redundant trivial or generalist information that schools tend to convey having teachings in school end up not being useful in future is also topic on 1050 forgot algebra although there randall conveys that it is normal and not an excuse to boast about one's ignorance the title text is a further exaggeration claiming that striking up a conversation with the strange kid at school could be far more important than all four years of a high school education  there is always the chance that that strange kid might turn out to be the next mark zuckerberg or that he knows a guy who can find you your first job or he's the one who tells you about his interest in a to you yet unknown topic and sparks your interest in it as well and maybe it turns into your future career or conversely the weird kid could be a school shooter
