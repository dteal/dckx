n exoplanets are planets outside of our solar system and exoplanet astronomers are astronomers who attempt to discover and study such planets megan is using a common exoplanet discovery technique to discover a planet around a nearby star when a planet passes between an observing astronomer and a star the planet will block some tiny part of the light coming from that star causing it to appear dimmer for some amount of time the kepler telescope used this technique to find evidence for exoplanets but here megan is standing on the surface of the earth at night looking at the ground and therefore presumably looking in the direction of the sun by observing that it is completely occluded at night she correctly concludes that the sun is orbited by at least one planet the earth the title text alludes to using more complicated techniques to observe light reflected by small planets like the earth for example by detecting polarized light reflected from the planet's atmosphere in some sense observing the light that reflects off of the earth during the day is in fact how we see everything around us it also implies that astronomers who because of their career choice are more likely to work at night might be completely unaware of earth's existence in the daytime and thus surprised to discover it from their nighttime work the title text may also be a reference to 1231 habitable zone where an astronomer is messed up by someone who puts a mirror in front of the telescope more details at methods of detecting exoplanets
