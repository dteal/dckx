n cueball has obtained a gun that shoots marshmallows and promptly decides to shoot at megan having taken the first few hits without much reaction she sighs and then brings out  the super soaker which was first used on her in 220 philosophy and soaks him with it  the next day everyone has such guns and starts shooting marshmallows at each other we see beret guy and megan who confront cueball saying hey noob eat stay puftxc2xae this is like saying eat lead when threatening someone with a regular gun since stay puft is a fictional brand of marshmallows from the ghostbusters movie  beret guy realizes that the streams of marshmallows are about to cross and shouts a warning but it is too late and they cross anyway this results in something gigantic appearing with a foom off screen it roars at the three friends megan looks up and states that this is bad as the giant shouts you're shooting what presumably the crossing marshmallows beams have recreated the stay puft marshmallow man from ghostbusters in the movie crossing the ghost capturing streams from the proton packs was bad but in the end in which an ancient spirit took the form of this giant marshmallow man the monster was destroyed as a side effect of crossing the streams  the stay puft man sees what they are shooting and is justifiably upset the title text is a further ghostbusters reference as bill murray was one of the actors in the movie since the crossing of the streams of the proton packs by bill murray and the other ghostbusters is related to the creation of the stay puft marshmallow man in the movie the crossing of the marshmallow streams in the comic does the opposite and summons an enormous bill murray
