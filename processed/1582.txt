n in this comic megan asks cueball to picture himself in a grassy field it is a standard technique to begin a visualization by asking the person to imagine that they are in some calm environment could be for any kind of meditation/mindfulness like for instance yoga a grassy field could have been replaced by a beach at the sea or a forest with sunbeams coming down through the trees proceeding with the visualization megan asks cueball to imagine a creature with the power to be able to escape from any visualized scene and then tries to convince him that this creature has indeed escaped from his current visualization as it indeed would be able to do she then proceeds by apologizing for this but then tells him warns him that it from now on might appear in cueball's daydreams so he should begin looking out for it this indicates that she is not at all sorry but did this intentionally to try and mess with cueball's head the idea of the possibility of escaping an imagined situation was already used in 248 hypotheticals now that megan has introduced both the idea of the creature and the idea that it may appear in his daydreams cueball will almost certainly think of it from time to time creating a self fulfilling prophecy in the title text megan proposes a solution to get rid of the creature in cueball's daydream namely by picturing the only creature that the first fears however if this new maybe quite scary creature should be able to pursue the original creature then it would also have to be able to move through visualized scenes just as easily and this is what megan pretends happens again so now the problem is that cueball has two creatures on the loose in his daydreams and even if the second scares the first away he would then still have the new one to worry about
