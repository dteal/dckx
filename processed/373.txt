n there are often people who claim to have supernatural powers but then when their powers are tested by some sort of experiment the experiment refutes their claims this comic summarizes all the data from such experiments observing that given the data it's very unlikely that supernatural powers actually exist the title text refers to a person who has claimed to have supernatural powers and suggests that he might really have such powers this invokes the fact that absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence although there has never previously been a confirmed example of a person with superpowers this does not prove that this is certainly impossible however the graph above suggests that although not impossible such an event would be highly unlikely no matter how much evidence we collect there is always some positive but vanishingly small chance that some person may hold supernatural powers alternatively the title text explains that even though there is no reason to believe anyone has any super powers some people are always ready to believe the next one to claim so very naive and the exact opposite meaning of the one described above knowing randall's comic this seems more likely in this case the two other comics mentioned has no relation to this comic the title itself may be a reference to the tv show supernatural's recap segment the road so far
