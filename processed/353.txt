n python is a programming language designed specifically to be make it easy to write clear readable programs flying is often used as a metaphor for freedom and ease and here randall shows cueball literally flying in response to using python a hello world program is a very simple program that prints the phrase hello world used in textbooks to illustrate a given programming language while this sounds simple it can be nontrivial in some programming languages where you need to explicitly import a library that contains the print function for instance in c you need to begin with #include &lt;stdioh&gt; or do complicated things with classes and variables see the java hello world for one example python doesn't need any of that print hello world or in python 30 printhello world really is all you need to do dynamic typing and significant whitespace are two controversial features of python which make some peoplexe2x80x94like cueball's friendxe2x80x94hesitant to use the language dynamic typing means that variables do not have types like list of short integers or a bunch of letters; any value of any type can be placed in any variable dynamic typing allows for more flexible languages but it means that certain kinds of errors like trying to subtract a letter from a number can't be caught until a program is run and some people think this is too dangerous for the tradeoff to be acceptable whitespaces are invisible text characters like spaces or tabs in programming blocks of code controlled by a statement are usually indented under that statement most languages require you to use braces xe2x80xa6 or special keywords beginxe2x80xa6end to delimit these blocks; in python the indentation itself is the delimiter many python programmers find that this makes code more readable but many other programmers find it too magical and don't trust it classes functions and constants in python are packed into modules to use a module you write import module at the top of your source file python comes with a very powerful standard library of modules to do everything from parsing xml to comparing two sets of files for differences and new modules can be easily installed from the pypi repository which has more than 79000 more to choose from as of april 2016 cueball can fly because he imported the antigravity module python still works for cueball in 482 height in the final panel cueball admits that his ability to fly may actually be because he has sampled everything in the medicine cabinet though he's sure it is the python anyway an implication of this is that ingesting everything in the medicine cabinet has given him the feeling of freedom and ease that flying represents or that he is hallucinating himself flying and having a conversation with the other character about it here the metaphor of feeling like you're flying while using python is transformed back from being literal cueball is actually flying to being metaphorical randall feels like he is flying because python is so easy to use or because he had too many strange drugs perl mentioned in the title text is another programming language with the same target audience as python as both are high level general purpose interpreted dynamic programming languages however they strongly oppose each other in their language design   perlxe2x80x99s philosophy for its syntax is xe2x80x9cthere's more than one way to do itxe2x80x9d so each coder can choose his own coding style to do exactly the same thing  pythonxe2x80x99s philosophy for its syntax is xe2x80x9cthere should be onexe2x80x94 and preferably only one xe2x80x94obvious way to do itxe2x80x9d so the written code is more consistent  since he has discovered python randall doesn't like perl anymore probably because its syntax is less consistent
