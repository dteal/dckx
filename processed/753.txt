n on may 25 1961 us president john f kennedy gave a speech before a joint session of congress in which he set as a goal for the american people the task of landing a man on the moon and returning him successfully to earth though kennedy didn't live to see that goal become a reality he was assassinated in 1963 the apollo 11 space capsule landed neil armstrong and buzz aldrin on the moon in july 1969 during that speech kennedy said the sentence that the comic is referring to and the map provided shows that the vast majority of the regions he mentioned are actually in the northern hemisphere despite kennedy calling them the whole southern half of the globe not to mention the southern hemisphere has regions which are not included like australia the actual meaning behind kennedy's statement is likely a reference to the common lingo used describing the 'third world' as 'the global south' which is a metaphorical rather than geographical description which includes all of the regions mentioned though leaving out the ussr from asia at the time a number of proxy wars between the us and the ussr had broken out and were in progress in many third world countries across the entirety of the regions mentioned thus kennedy was describing the cold war and his expectation that it would continue and that the 'global south' would be the actual battlefield out of context and insisting on a literal geographic interpretation for the words this part of the speech sounds particularly funny the title text refers to a september 1962 speech kennedy gave at rice university one of the most famous quotes from that speech is we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard randall suggests that all of the arguments kennedy made for going to the moon could also serve the cause of many different innovations
