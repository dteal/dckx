n avatar is a 2009 movie that was very popular in theaters becoming the highest grossing of all time the comic illustrates how someone in a new relationship tends to be overly eager and giddy to let everyone know about it while others tend to not be all that interested the character on the left is so excited to let everyone know that he goes off panel to get a ladder and a loudspeaker the second character thinks it should be legal to murder or at least wound him for this annoyance if he acts like this for more than a week the first character is so giddy that he doesn't notice what he has done and even tries to mention his girlfriend again the title text describes a very harsh way to respond to this annoyance since someone in the position of the first character is so excited about the new romantic commitment in their life their friend brings up the much greater and more serious commitment of marriage if they have only been dating for a week or less it is probably much too early for them to seriously think about marriage the friend then implies that if they aren't already excited to marry her then he doesn't really love her the end result is that the first character doesn't want to talk about his relationship anymore
