n cueball acts like a small boy finding a tape measure and then playing with it he then extends it to 8 feet approx 25 meters wondering whether or not that was a record which makes him imagine a sport where extending the tape measure as far as possible was the goal tape measure strips are bent upward lengthwise to support itself when oriented correctly much like how one can better hold a sheet of paper horizontally by creating a slight dip however as a tape measure is extended the weight of the strip eventually overcomes the support offered by the bend causing it to collapse skillfully holding the tape measure at an angle can redirect some of the weight load and allow for a longer total extension; it is implied that this technique can be explored to the point of becoming its own sport the title text refers to a future where this sport exists and this comic is a representation of the origin of this sport
