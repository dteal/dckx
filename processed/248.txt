n the comic is in short a new take on the common comedy trope in which characters in a thought bubble will sometimes look out of the bubble and talk directly to the person thinking it another person nearby or even the viewer in this comic however it features cueball and beret guy in a conversation together in which beret guy creates a hypothetical situation by imagining he had ice cream this then to cueball's dismay creates a hypothetical situation in which beret guy has ice cream which he promptly begins to eat cueball then creates a hypothetical situation in which his hypothetical self has a knife to 'cut' out of the thought he then gives this knife to cueball who supposedly will use it to cut out of his hypothetical situation the title text puts the comic into context noting the unlikely possibility xe2x80x94 and your most likely surprised reaction xe2x80x94 if a person in a hypothetical situation you'd involuntarily created managed to break out of it and suddenly appear in your room or it could be understood the other way that a person you have forced into your hypothetical situation breaks free from it and disappears from your room also it points out that the situation is in fact a hypothetical situation itself creating some irony another thought bubble comic can be seen in 429 fantasy and the topic of people escaping from hypothetical situations appears again in 1582 picture a grassy field
