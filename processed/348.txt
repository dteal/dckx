n this is randall's version of the popular carpenters song they long to be close to you the actual first verse goes like this  why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near just like me they long to be close to you  in this parody the reason birds suddenly appear whenever the girl is near is because the girl is a zombie and those are turkey vultures carrion birds that prey on the flesh of dead bodies  the title text is joking about couples not discussing their relationship before their wedding as is seen here
