n phishing is a scam where a criminal sends emails or other messages often large numbers of them pretending to be from a trusted institution in order to obtain passwords credit card numbers or other personal details of victims the term is a neologism playing on the term fishing because the process is likened to dangling bait and waiting for someone to bite phishing is illegal under both traditional fraud laws and modern cybercrime laws a fishing license is a government issued permit allowing the catching of fish in controlled waters cueball saw the sign offering phishing licenses and was immediately arrested by the receptionist ponytail upon applying for one there is no need for a license for a crime like fraud so it is dubious an authority would issue them hence why cueball should have been more suspicious of the offer the joke is that the process of offering phishing licenses is analogous to the process of phishing itself they pretend to be a legitimate business and display a sign with a false offer hoping someone will be fooled into interacting with them while the ideal phishing attempt is indistinguishable from the real thing that's generally impossible to attain and there are always some ways to identify it as a scam but still some people fall into the trap partly because they don't know what to be on the alert for and partly because the attempt is often directed at so many people at once that statistically there will be some that will fall for it still as cueball himself states he should have known it was a scam the title text reveals that cueball's arrest was itself a scam not an actual police sting adding even more phishing to the phishing for potential phishers he has been put in jail but is allowed to walk out after paying a bail of $10000 only to find that when he gets back out on the street it is not the street on which the county jail has its address so ponytail is actually not trying to capture people who would be interested in scamming people she is trying to scam those people instead; although this is illegal it may be rather clever as such people might not be likely to go to the police another joke in the title text is that a way to recognize phishing attempts is to look at the address of the website or in his false prison sentence the street address instead of the web address
