n cueball awakens to find himself trapped for eternity in an endless expanse of sand and rocks at first he uses this time to derive all of mathematics and physics including quantum mechanics and general relativity next cueball creates a computer that can process any possible function out of rocks and rules for the interaction between rocks he then simulates a particle followed by the interactions between particles followed by the entire universe the amount of time it takes to simulate the change in the universe from one instant to the next takes an extremely long time as the time it takes to update just one row of rocks can be measured in googols of years assuming a realistic time to place each rock cueball then apologizes for any flaws we see in the simulation this implies that the audience is living in cueball's simulation making cueball essentially god the final frame cuts to a classroom where a bored student stares at his hands waiting for class to end cueball admonishes the student for thinking that class is lasting forever the joke being that the boredom felt in a classroom is nothing compared to the boredom that inspires cueball to spend his time toiling to keep the universe moving indeed the minutes of lecture actually took many billions and billions of millennia for cueball to simulate the title text suggests that rule 34 should be called on wolfram's rule 34 rule 34 see 305 rule 34 is a humorous rule of the internet which states if you can imagine it there is porn of it no exceptions wolfram's rule 34 is a cellular automaton therefore the title text says that someone has made pornography featuring the cellular automaton in question
