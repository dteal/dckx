n cueball is arguing  with a conspiracy theorist who is sitting in front of his computer talking back they are probably using skype as cueball later asks  him to watch closely holding his phone up to show the other guy what he is doing  cueball's opponent seems to ignore all reliable sources like snopes and wikipedia on top of several journals instead preferring sources that are seemingly not credible but that do agree with him these conspiracy net pages typically just have a black background and uses several different sizes of fonts the larger and probably also in bright colors the more convincing seems to be the belief and cueball cannot take these kind of sources seriously net websites can be made by anyone and have little limitations the maker of a net does not need to show sources of information or even their name as such net websites are notoriously unreliable and often have viruses or other malware the truth about black helicopters is an example of one such website supposedly explaining the truth behind government black helicopters the conspiracy theorist insists that by trusting reliable sources cueball is simply buying in to the cover up cueball says he can win the argument and will show him how and then ceases to argue further in favor of going down a waterslide while holding up the phone to show the other guy how to have a good time since conspiracy theorists tend to be intransigent cueball sees himself as the victor after ceasing to argue with a guy who cannot be argued with and instead decides to have some fun this is even improved by the fact that it makes his opponent angry  the joke here is also in the title of the comic which is argument victory something that is very hard to achieve by on the web cueball won this victory not by arguing but by stopping this argument he was having with someone that could/would not be argued with the title text points out that belief in a conspiracy presupposes that those with the power to carry out the conspiracy actually have a plan a situation which might be found more comforting than the alternative that those in power are just muddling through with no plan at all this concept is revisited in 1274 open letter
