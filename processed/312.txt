n this comic presents a poem about a god's dilemma of whether to create the world using perl or lisp two popular computer programming languages the god has chosen to write it in perl but since then appears to lament the choice apparently expressing that if given the chance to write the world's code again he or she or it would use lisp instead the implication is that a universe created by lisp would look better under close examination the 'founding myth' referred to in the poem  instead of an incomprehensible big bang inflation dark matter and dark energy the elegance of lisp may have led to more elegantly framed laws of nature the grammar of lisp as a language requires the programmer to use a multitude of parentheses and in many cases it can be difficult to determine whether all of the parentheses have been properly matched up to one another the last two lines of the poem refer to the plentiful parentheses in lisp and the image at the bottom of the panel shows a close parenthesis at the supposed end of the universe a segmentation fault also commonly called a segfault is an error that occurs when a computer program attempts to access computer memory to which it should not have access  this is a fatal error that will cause the program to stop executing this comic deals with similar subject matter to 224 lisp in which one of the gods claims that although the universe may appear to have been written in lisp it was actually written mostly using perl the poem itself and the title text are a parody of fire and ice written by the american poet robert frost and first published in 1920 in this poem the speaker discusses his stance in the debate on whether the world will be destroyed in fire or in ice a god's lament has a rhyme scheme that is nearly identical to that of frost's poem however it differs in that lisp does not rhyme with men again and paren while the corresponding four lines in frost's poem do rhyme
