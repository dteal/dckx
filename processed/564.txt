n there are conflicting theories as to the meaning of this comic  since the experimental confirmation or denial of the higgs mechanism was widely recognized as important to the development of physics the experimenters involved were likely to receive nobel prizes nobel prizes however are only given to living people and groups of up to three in size the experimenters therefore are preparing to fight to the death when the discovery comes peter higgs had made a statement in 2008 hinting that the confirmation would come within one year and that statement was made one year before the tuesday mentioned in the comic tentative experimental confirmation of the higgs boson was made in july 2013 at the time this was written there was much hype about the higgs mechanism as it was a theory explaining how particles got their masses experimental confirmation of the higgs mechanism and its signature particle the higgs boson was seen with such importance that the boson was dubbed the god particle detecting it however required accelerating particles to energies higher than ever before since this was at the cutting edge of physics it was unknown what would actually happen there were fears that the experiment would create a micro black hole or worse this comic could be seen as applying those fears to a common trope in horror movies and video games where a mutant infestation is created by unknowing scientists the scientists here apart from poor cueball have done their research and armed themselves for any upcoming dangers it is unknown whether these dangers are specific or not some argue that velociraptors are a common enough theme in xkcd that the experimenters are preparing for a velociraptor attack others point out that the crossbow is a weapon in the game series half life whose plot has a similar infestation following failed physical experiment ripping dimensional seams they mention that someone at the particle accelerator closely resembled one of the main characters of half life of course the crossbows may just be a general preparation for danger finally this comic may simply be general sympathy for those late to catch on to something substituting different things for crossbow and higgs excitation would give a similar situation for cueball randall apparently hates these situations a layer of metahumor could be present here as cueball may represent the clueless readers of xkcd who have to go to the forum or this wiki to understand its comics  the proper interpretation of this comic or whether there even is one remains an open question
