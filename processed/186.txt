n this comic relates to video game consoles at the time this comic was published there were three major products competing the playstation 3 by sony the xbox 360 by microsoft and the wii by nintendo when a game console gets released fans are often seen queuing outside the stores or camping on the pavement in order to be among the first to get their hands on a console the comic shows such a console camp and points out the differences between the fan communities while the fans waiting in line for a sony or microsoft product are very rude the nintendo fans are apologetic and try to comfort that is to say console those who arrived too late to obtain a package the clichxc3xa9 that nintendo fans are nicer and more polite may be attributed to the fact that the wii is targeted at children and families while the ps3 and the xbox are targeted at the serious gamer crowd the title text primarily expresses randall's distance from the console wars he has never owned a game console beforewhile also indicating an inclination towards the nintendo wii
