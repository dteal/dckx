n this comic is the xkcd christmas special from the year 2008 the prologue states that due to the 2008 financial crisis only very few images of the strip could be produced leaving the others to be blacked out it is therefore left to the reader to reconstruct the whole story based on the given images while it is claimed that the reconstruction should be rather easy the complicated and abstruse plot line makes it nearly impossible to fill the gaps any attempt at inferring the missing images would therefore be largely guesswork the comic features the well known xkcd characters getting involved in a strange fight with cyborgs and raptors on christmas eve the line we apologize for the inconvenience is possibly a reference to the famous book series the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy by douglas adams it appears there as god's final message to his creation written in letters of fire on the side of the quentulus quazgar mountains panel 2 megan strives to outdo some christmas lights she has seen on youtube panel 3 dissatisfied with her work megan is thinking about alternative ways improve her light arrangement the idea of firing sodium pellets into snow is probably a bad one as sodium reacts exothermically with water and may in large amounts induce explosions panel 5 probably still obsessed with the idea of creating a large and impressive light display megan has constructed an electronic device with an arduino processor perhaps to make the light chain show patterns however the amount of energy she used was apparently too high causing one of the control boards to vaporize she then wishes she could make the system self repairing panel 7 megan's device has developed artificial intelligence allowing it to feel this is presumably a result of megan attempting to make the device self repairing this common trope in science fiction works usually leads to the system's attempting to eradicate its creator cueball attributes the emergence of a personality to awesome ease and power of programming in python panel 11 out of context this panel introduces the idea of santa claus being a muslim this may be a reference to the persistent internet rumors that barack obama is a muslim though he declares himself to be a christian however the statement could also relate to the fact the santa claus is usually displayed with a large beard which is sometimes also sported by conservative muslims  or it could just be non sensical panel 13 at this point the self aware christmas light control systems has apparently released cyborgs that tried to kill megan and cueball in order to repel the cyborgs they have cloned velociraptors cueball expresses doubt whether that was really a good idea velociraptors appear frequently in xkcd cf comics 87 135 and 292 panel 17 as predicted the raptors have gone wild but megan cueball and the two smaller characters perhaps their children managed to cage the dinosaurs they believe themselves safe unless the raptors learn how to build lightsabers this is a reference to a line in jurrasic park where the main characters believe themselves safe unless the raptors can learn how to open doors panel 19 the raptors have indeed succeeded with constructing lightsabers and must now be fought the clever girl is a reference to a line from jurassic park where the raptors outflank and kill one of the human characters wearing a similar hat panel 23 it billionaire bill gates has mistakenly killed santa claus possibly in a sword fight he claims to have mistaken him for richard stallman a prominent free software activist gates strongly opposes the idea of free software and is therefore considered an antagonist by many of its supporters the most striking resemblance between stallman and santa claus is probably the long and untamed beard comic 225 is one of the most famous xkcd comics and features stallman involved in a sword fight panel 29 megan asks black hat where he obtained the enormously large christmas tree that can be seen on the right side of the picture it is implied that he logged yggdrasil a giant ash tree in norse mythology according to tradition yggdrasil is the world tree representing the whole of creation and holding together the cosmological structure panel 31 randall wishes merry christmas to all xkcd readers the title text refers to panel 7 in python modules are imported using the import module syntax skynet is a self aware artificial intelligence system featured in the terminator film series as the main antagonist importing the skynet module might therefore account for megan's system's developing an evil personality note that this comic was first published in another version that had panel 29 as panel 27 and the merry christmas from xkcd message at the bottom as 27 is not a prime number the current version was published in lieu of the erroneous one it has been observed that the top left nine panels form a glider in conway's game of life the glider is sometimes used as an emblem representing hacker subculture although rotated by 90 degrees it remains however unclear whether the occurrence in the comic is intentional or owed to the prime number pattern
