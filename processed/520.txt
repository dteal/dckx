n it appears that cueball and megan are physicists visiting a biology lab their guide a biologist looking like cueball gives them a description of the humble cuttlefish that is both accurate and makes them sound like other worldly creatures with highly advanced capabilities the scene takes an unusual turn when the scientist implies that the cuttlefish have been easily trained to improve their capabilities he then demonstrates this by giving a simple command whereupon the cuttlefish rises out of the water only to attack and kill both cueball and megan demonstrating an ability to fly talk and discharge lethal electric shocks in the process see also 35 sheep this is all revealed to be a dream but it has given cueball a warning not to underestimate the biologists apparently they can be just as crazy and dangerous as any other kind of scientist cueball that represent randall as it is xkcd that salutes in the final panel offers a toast to all biologists everywhere and plans an alliance with them against the chemists hoping to prevent further attacks on physicists he is then shown drinking from a laboratory flask something which any scientist would be wary of in the past randall has been somewhat dismissive of the non math/non physics scientific disciplines so this comic may be trying to mend some bridges with biologists but not with chemists in the title text cs stands for computer science the robot revolution references events in film and literature wherein robots having become commonplace in the workforce achieve independent thought and declare war on humanity like in the terminator the matrix or the movie i robot randall implies that the physicists will switch sides if the robot revolution arrives first cephalopod is the class of animals that encompasses cuttlefish as well as squids and octopuses
