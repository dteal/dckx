n this comic is about disputed territories and polar orbits at mission control the main controller is planning the next check in with the space shuttle which is set to occur at 320n 355e approx 20 miles north east of jerusalem over the hotly contested israeli palestinian territories frank and the other off screen character start to dispute the ownership of this geographical location and rather than getting involved in an argument the main character decides to change the check in to 352n 966w approximately 50miles east of oklahoma city oklahoma which he considers to be a neutral and non disputed location unfortunately frank is a dick and he then starts to make the claim that part of oklahoma in fact should belong to texas in the title text randall points out correctly that the satellite would probably require a polar orbit a vertical orbit passing the poles of the earth with each orbit to reach both palestine and oklahoma which cannot be achieved from a launch at cape caneveral as the launch trajectories would cause debris and spent fuel tanks from the shuttle during its ascent to fall in heavily populated areas thus randall proposes that the comic exists in an alternate history in which the space shuttles launch from vandenburg this is a reference to the plans to launch shuttles from there before the challenger accident occurred after challenger was lost the polar orbiting missions were scrapped and cape canaveral became the sole launch site for the space shuttle another possibility in this alternate history is that the rules forbidding orbital launches from canaveral to a polar inclination don't exist because nobody likes the outer banks which would be in the flight path and thus don't care about space debris falling on them
