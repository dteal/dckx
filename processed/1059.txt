n this comic is a take on the 90s tv series fresh prince of bel air and its much parodied and repeated theme song consequently the song coming out of cueball's tv right now is a take on that song the joke is that will smith has somehow gone from being a successful rap star to an ambitious politician doggerel is a derogatory term for verse considered of little literary value or a comic verse of irregular measure or in this case rap music obviously the song is updated with a reference to adele who was of course not performing during the series' run seeing as she was two years old at its start in the last panel cueball is annoyed about this stupid show and he switches to another channel or turns the tv off the timing of the click indicates that he became annoyed when the song turned into a political advertisement and/or he did not want to hear some adele for ya be rhymed with the name of the city philadelphia the title text refers to mr smith goes to washington a 1939 academy award winning movie about an idealistic young man who is chosen to be a senator and soon finds himself battling corrupted politicians perhaps as will smith might be in this comic the two characters/character and actor is a coincidence that randall plays on aaron sorkin is the writer behind the comedy drama the american president and the creator of political television drama the west wing
