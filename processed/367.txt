n this comic refers to the concept of fandom which is basically the collective noun for fans of a given thing usually this is used in the context of people who like a certain work of fiction like star trek or buffy the vampire slayer here cueball digs through a box and discovers his old collection of star wars books referring to authors timothy zahn and michael a stackpole who wrote several star wars novels and the corellian trilogy these books are part of the star wars expanded universe which is used to refer to media that is star wars canon but not the films   almost all of the expanded universe content created prior to 2015 is now considered by disney who are the owners of lucasfilm and star wars since 2012 to be part of a separate canon called legends a decision presumably made to allow a cleaner slate for the upcoming sequel trilogy and spin off movies to start from cueball apparently loved these books as a kid which prompts megan to remark if he started becoming a fan of other science fiction series like firefly or battlestar galactica to which he clarifies that he simply grew out of the fandom mindset megan perhaps sarcastically asks him about how politician ron paul who has appeared in the comic several times is doing and cueball excitedly runs off to check ironically disproving his earlier remark people don't outgrow a fandom state of mind but rather shift their point of interest the title refers to the new republic the main government in star wars after the final film and corusca gems which are extremely rare and valuable gems from the aforementioned expanded universe the text says that ron paul wants the new republic to adopt the corusca gem as standard currency this entire joke is an allegory for the gold standard which ron paul is a personal advocate of even though it is no longer in use by the united states
