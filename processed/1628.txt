n cueball shows megan an app play magnus ios android which claims to simulate playing chess against magnus carlsen at various ages carlsen is a chess grandmaster who is the world champion as of the date this comic was released the idea behind the app is that as carlsen grows up he becomes better at chess and thus it become exceedingly difficult to beat him as he gets older as cueball claims he could have beaten magnus when he was 8xc2xbd year old but not a half year later we can now estimate cueballs strength to be that of a typical adult hobbyist with a fide rating of about 12001 taking the idea a step further megan wants such an app for other sports tennis and swimming where skill couldn't imaginably be simulated via an app at all she wants to compare herself to an 8 year old serena williams a top ranked professional tennis player or to a 6 year old michael phelps the most decorated olympian competitor of all time cueball expands beyond sport wishing to determine if he could cook better than an 11 year old martha stewart author of several cookbooks megan wonders if she'd have won an election against a 12 year old jfk john f kennedy the 35th american president obviously cooking and politics were skills acquired later in life for both figures  also the us constitution prohibits anyone from serving as president before the age of 35 so it seems unlikely that any 12 year old candidate could win regardless of skill level simply because voters would not want to elect someone ineligible to serve for another 23 years such a contest would likely be prohibited altogether as ineligible candidates tend to have ballot access issues cueball and megan continue speculating about an app simulating the skills of random celebrities at various ages even beyond the talents that made them famous they finally end up comparing 8 year old magnus's swimming skill against 9 year old martha's he wins but they'd both lose a hot dog eating contest against the championship race horse secretariat at this point even megan realizes with considerable understatement their project has gotten weird the title text extends the point to even greater absurdity eg the ludicrous prospect of a young martha stewart knocking an adult ronda rousey unconscious or 9 year old muhammad ali beating a 10 year old jfk in air hockey the horse also gets re mentioned in the title text losing in a hot dog eating contest against 12 year old ken jennings ronda rousey is an olympic bronze medalist judoka and mma fighter; when this comic was released ronda rousey had just lost to holly holm in a major upset muhammad ali is one of the all time great boxers at the time of this comic ken jennings is the record holder for his winning streak on jeopardy chess was previously compared to basketball in 1392 dominant players which also mentioned magnus this is the tenth comic about chess on xkcd
