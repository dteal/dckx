n parts of speech can be treated fluidly in english and other languages for example medalled has been coined as a word meaning gained a medal in a sporting competition implying the existence of the verb to medal meaning to win a medal megan in conversation with cueball similarly creates new meanings from existing words firstly she uses the adjective legit a slang abbreviation of legitimate as an adverb to mean legitimately; secondly she uses the noun adverb as a verb meaning to turn a non adverb into an adverb; and thirdly she uses the noun phrase language nerd as an adjective all three are used in the past tense megan uses the words verbed and adjectived without any comment implying that the acts of verbing the nouns verb and adjective are so natural and long established that they are unremarkable although the fact that adjectived came after verbed may also have something to do with the latter's non mention even if grammatical purists might decry such usage an example of a change of parts of speech that is widely accepted is the gerund which is nothing more than the use of a verb or verb phrase as a noun; for instance i enjoy reading and the best thing for your health is not smoking added humor is gained by the self referential nature of megan's sentence she uses fluid parts of speech and also refers to that very same use in one sentence the title text not to go all sentence fragment on you is an implicitly self referential sentence fragment containing neither an explicit subject nor a predicate it can be converted into a full sentence by rephrasing it something like i do not mean to go all sentence fragment on you but  it is also funnier because as well as being self referential it also refers to the main comic by adjectiving the noun phrase sentence fragment
