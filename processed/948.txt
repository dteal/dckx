n this comic is a reference to the wildly funny video of two cleverbots talking to each other by recording and analyzing whatever humans type into its input they can sound pretty human to whoever is reading their response megan has been watching the video and ask cueball about it he says it's just clumsy sampling as they are still very far from sounding like humans and holding normal conversations  megan then sums up that as of the release of this comic computers were good at chess and at driving cars through a desert ie a place with no obstacles to hit the ability of such self driving cars would improve much later with this comic being the first with a direct reference to such cars later self driving cars became a recurring topic on xkcd but they cannot hold a conversation for five minutes and she thus concludes that a cleverbot would be perfect for attending burning man burning man is a week long event held yearly in black rock city nevada the festival encourages an artistic anti establishment philosophy and attracts a broad but devoted following combining hippies anarchists nudists techno utopians and survivialists shows of custom cars on the desert plain is a big part of burning man and mind games like chess are a popular way to pass the time there however a common joke about burning man attendees is that they can only talk about burning man hence why they can't hold a five minute conversation a tradition of burning man is not to shower while you are there mostly because all water must be brought in from offsite and of course cleverbot reacts badly in showers because if you do try to shower a cleverbot you end up with a shorted out computer
