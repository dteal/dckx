n in this comic cueball and megan are anticipating guests  offering coffee to house guests is a commonly accepted courtesy in the united states and most of the western world however they seem to be unaware of the basics of coffee making cueball is concerned that this lack of knowledge is an indication of their mutual immaturity thinking of himself as a fake adult  this comic thus follows a frequently used theme of people growing up but finding themselves unable or unwilling to accept traditional adult roles see 150 grownups 441 babies 616 lease 905 homeownership and 1674 adult while there are cultures where coffee is served to children it is generally seen in the united states and western world as an adult beverage&#8212;like beer which has also served as the subject in the comic 1534 beer megan is however confident that the necessary steps can be determined the steps she follows however are quite unorthodox she attempts to make coffee by pouring the ingredients on the ground misinterpreting the meaning of ground coffee sucking it up with a dyson vacuum cleaner misinterpreting the meaning of vacuum brewing then boiling the mixture by placing the vacuum cleaner's removable plastic canister over a hot stove and pouring the resulting sludge through the vacuum cleaner filter instead of a standard coffee filter megan says she is a regular starbuck after pouring the batch of coffee believing the name of the cafe chain starbucks to be synonymous with the actual job title barista further indicating a general lack of knowledge regarding the subject of coffee the starbucks coffee chain was loosely named after the fictional character starbuck from the book moby dick she could be referring to this although starbuck had nothing to do with coffee brewing see more trivia about starbuck below this method of making coffee would be very expensive as it would most likely destroy the vacuum cleaner canister and filter if the vacuum cleaner had ever been used then it would not be very hygienic either although if it had not been used then the floor would probably also be very unhygienic anyway on the other hand floors are always unhygienic since the plastic from the canister has probably also gone into contact with the sludge after being heated over open fire there is a high risk that this coffee is actually poisonous for more than one reason the title text refers to the expense of replacing the filter as vacuum cleaner filters are considerably more costly than single use coffee filters this was the first of two comics in a row about food the next being 1744 metabolism
