n this comic re imagines a scene from ender's game by orson scott card this is shown in the first two panels depicting the siblings locke and demosthenes as cueball and the girl their real names are peter and valentine wiggin and these first names are used in the official transcript on xkcd in the book these two kids write their opinions on their worlds version of the internet to gain extreme political influence below is a synopsis spoiler alert  in the book ender is an above average intelligence boy who is selected to become a potential leader of earth's defense forces in the event of another bugger invasion later re titled the formic invasions meanwhile ender's two older siblings peter and valentine decide to save the world from itself they do this by asserting themselves as wise demagogues who comment on political events on what are known as the free nets which are nets open to comment by anyone in the world they choose pseudonyms to write under as no one would take the words of children seriously they choose locke peter's pseudonym and demosthenes valentine's and begin work eventually they gain enough respect to be invited to participate in moderated political debates in the higher class nets by the end of the book peter has become the leader of the world as valentine runs away with ender to a planet formerly inhabited by buggers to live out their lives in peace end spoiler alert ender's game was published in 1985 when most people had never used and some had never heard of the internet the first webpage set up with individual personal opinions leaving out forums and bulletin board services was online in 1994 the word weblog was invented in 1997 and blog in 1999 when orson scott card wrote ender's game peter and valentine's plan was based on a sci fi idea expected to occur in the near future however this apparently science fictional future concept is now just the mundane and extremely un influential act of blogging in 1985 orson scott card's idea of how politics works in practice may have seemed a little naive but now that blogging is an everyday phenomenon peter and valentine's aspirations seem downright silly we see their plan to win vast political influence manifest itself as a wordpress blog and a particularly unimportant one at that with 0 comments on most posts the joke hinges on the underwhelming reversal of peter and valentine's expectations it forms both a parody of science fiction that has been rendered outdated by technology and also a parody of the expectations well intentioned people have going onto the internet to express their opinions the titles of peter's blog posts parody the arrogance of internet commentators with names beginning with things like everyone's wrong about this further underscores the lack of influence his wordpress blog would have and his naivete as this is a typically unconvincing way to speak to people about politics but someone with the arrogance to think everyone will naturally see their genius and insist they be put in charge of the world would not realise it in the bottom right corner there are links to other blogs one is for demosthenes but the other is for fivethirtyeight a real political blog that was founded by nate silver in 2008 more than a year before this comic was released it was still owned by nate in 2009 the year of this comics release but 2010 the blog became a licensed feature of the new york times online and in july 2013 espn announced that it would become the owner the blog takes its name from the number of electors in the united states electoral college 538 it is a website that focuses on opinion poll analysis politics economics and sports blogging nate silver has been referenced several times in xkcd though mainly in the title text before this comic for instance in 500 election the title text uses locke's full name peter wiggin and is formed as a short letter that informs him that he has become the president of the world and that he should meet tomorrow 800 sharp at the united nations un headquarters this is a very child like representation of how a presidential appointment might be announced further riffing on the naivete of the plan in the first place  also note that the note is addressed to peter rather than locke; peter's attempt to remain anonymous has failed miserably the title text says that peter got the presidential post because he received enough up votes on his reddit comments during their conversation peter is shown feeding a squirrel in ender's game the character of peter wiggin is a sadistic sociopath and there is a particular scene in the book where valentine stumbles across a skinned squirrel still twitching in pain references to both ender's game and squirrels are frequently recurring tropes in xkcd
