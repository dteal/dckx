n       this explanation may be incomplete or incorrect is there not some kind of slang on head goose that could relate to the fourth in line to the gb throne more on the title text an idea for a migrationif you can address this issue please edit the page thanks migrating refers to the changing of a habitat which happens every year with birds like geese that travel long distances to avoid cold seasons and get back to the food in the summer time when geese fly to their new habitat they tend to fly in a very clear v formation the v formation improves the efficiency of flying birds particularly over long migratory routes all the birds except the first fly in the upwash from one of the wingtip vortices of the bird ahead the upwash assists each bird except for the leading one in supporting its own weight in flight saving them up to 20% of the energy needed it should be noted that geese do have family structures with adult geese in alpha positions but not a strict ranking order an individual's position in formation flights is coincidental and constantly changing so that the goose at the point of the formation can pull back and rest in the v wings while others lead the swarm popular earlier beliefs about an alpha goose heading a formation for the entire flight is a myth easily disproven by watching geese formations in flight  this comic shows such a formation with 20 geese with several geese and areas in the v formation labeled giving different roles to the geese and assigning these areas a new meaning see the table below apart from a twin engine goose in the bottom right arm of the v the only part of the formation that would not normally be seen is kevin who flies off at a 45 degree angle in that direction there is no aerodynamic help from the other birds and in the title text the rest of the geese also exclaim dammit kevin when he again tells them that he has a great new idea for a migration maybe referring to the new direction
