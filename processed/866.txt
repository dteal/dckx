n compass and straightedge constructions are a class of problems in classical geometry they take the form using only a compass and a straightedge construct x where x is a geometric figure such as a regular pentagon the subject is typically covered in high school mathematics three such constructions squaring the circle trisecting the angle and doubling the cube remained unsolved for thousands of years before being shown impossible with the use of modern algebraic techniques the comic begins as if it were stating a problem in classical geometry but veers into an observation that no amount of technical knowledge can substitute for human companionship an additional layer of humor is that cueball is a stick figure so technically it is possible to create friends with a straightedge and a compass a figure constructed like cueball is ferdinand von lindemann was a german mathematician who showed in 1882 that pi is not a zero of any polynomial with rational coefficients ie it is a transcendental number transcendental numbers cannot be constructed with straightedge and compass this proves that squaring the circle a problem where it is required to construct a square with the same area as a given circle is impossible being as the sides of the square would need to be xe2x88x9axcfx80 times the radius of the circle and pi is not constructible
