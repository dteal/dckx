n computer operating systems were initially written for the business environment thus they were made to be accessible to multiple employees or users but only fully accessible to administrators or admins regular users can access and use programs on the computer but only the admin is allowed to make changes to how the computer runs  this same split level of security continues to this day even in privately owned or home computers the joke here is that the most important things on a computer are no longer the programs that it runs but the private personal data it accesses usually online anyone who wished to do real mischief on an active computer could do considerable damage without ever caring what the admin password was the admin password in effect now guards a vault no one cares about this comic pokes fun at the authorization mechanisms surrounding most operating systems' administrator accounts it makes the argument that the user's data is more valuable than the integrity of the system this is arguably true for most personal systems although it is probably not true in a shared server setup where a system compromise could lead to the exposure of many users' data essentially once a user is logged in he or she can typically access all of his or her data without any further restriction modifying the operating system for example to install drivers requires a separate password the title text alludes to the security practice where computers automatically lock the user out after a few minutes requiring a password from the user in order to continue using it instead randall's computer automatically switches to his brother's account presumably compromising them instead of his own
