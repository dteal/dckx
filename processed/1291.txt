n the comic and the title text both parody the motivational quote attributed to leslie brown which originally says shoot for the moon even if you miss you'll land among the stars in the original form the phrase shoot for the moon is figurative meant to inspire people to pursue ambitious goals reasoning that even if they fail to achieve them they may still accomplish other great things while trying the comic and title text on the other hand is literally referring to the moon and using the word shoot not in the sense of aspire but to mean fire a weapon at the comic further explores the humorous motivations for shooting the moon; megan wants to destroy and kill the moon in order to humble it feeling taunted by its orbiting merrily over her head and so she inspires her students to physically attempt to destroy the moon whenever possible only to become sheepish when she realizes the moon is right behind her as if it were a person who could become offended by what she is saying this is of course a common comedy trope the title text invokes another literal interpretation of the phrase if a space vehicle aims at the moon and misses it will end up in a new orbit possibly depending on its velocity escaping from the earth moon system and following a separate but nearby orbit around the sun a solar orbit is very hard very fuel intensive and very lengthy to return from despite physically meaning you will remain very close to earth even close enough to see it with some optical magnification thus as a hypothetical space explorer's life support gradually ran out because his craft could not make it back to earth in time he would be taunted by earth remaining close to him
