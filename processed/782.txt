n megan and rob are horrified to discover that the bones they had dug up and turned into puppets were actually from an ancient indian or presumably native american's burial ground the joke is that they already seem to know that they were indian bones so their origins really shouldn't come as a surprise they actually already know that they are desecrating something holy hence the title the humor comes from the fact that digging up indian bones obviously makes it already an indian burial ground but apparently it didn't occur to megan until much after she and rob knowingly desecrated a site at which indians had been buried that they had been at an indian burial ground which is a common site of mystery and negative supernatural occurrences in horror films etc such stories usually involve a building built on top of over the burial ground becoming haunted which is why megan uses the phrase above a common trope in horror fiction is that anyone defiling an ancient indian burial ground will have a horrible curse cast upon them another common trope is having a curse cast upon oneself by a gypsy or voodoo woman or a wizened wizard or monk as mentioned in the title text megan and rob seem to be unknowingly and stupidly angering every supernatural being and force in their entire town thus setting themselves up for at least a dozen potential horror plots at the same time a common complaint about many horror stories is that the protagonists are flat out stupid in order to make the plot and horror work this comic deliberately targets and makes fun of this mocking the obliviousness that many stock horror characters show as to getting themselves into trouble with supernatural forces
