n in this comic white hat quotes a famous definition of insanity usually attributed to albert einstein but may be a loose paraphrasing from narcotics anonymous adapted by rita mae brown or others historically cueball's answer applies the quote to the action of quoting that quote white hat seems to have quoted that quote quite a few times already expecting people to change their behavior which hasn't happened so far so according to that definition of insanity it is insane to keep quoting the definition of insanity expecting people to change their behavior because of that merriam webster defines insane as mentally disabled the title text implies that randall would be insane according to the quote he used in the comic because he has repeatedly searched for a definition of insanity that matches the one quotes in the comic and of course always gets a negative result since this is a personal quote not a definition besides searching in lots of dictionaries he also looked in the dsm 4 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 4th edition the dsm 5 has been available since may 18 2013 and he plans to look into it expecting different results since he won't find it he is from the quote insane but of course since this turns out to not be the definition of insanity then he might not be anyway this comic follows a pattern similar to 1339 when you assume
