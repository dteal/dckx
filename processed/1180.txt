n randall uses an euler diagram technically not a venn diagram to make fun of clueless computer users a common response to any computer problem is maybe it has a virus the circles in the diagram don't overlap meaning 1 problems that people suspect are virus caused are never virus caused 2 problems that are actually virus caused are never suspected by people to be caused by a virus the title text refers to the technological singularity a hypothetical point in the future when superintelligence emerges in computers so that they can build new computers with ever increasing intelligence it is seen as impossible to predict what would happen beyond this point; hence the term singularity 1084 server problem makes a joke on this defragging is short for disk defragmentation an easy user friendly action that pc users can undertake to supposedly make their computers run faster it is therefore a common all round recommendation to do this regardless of the problem randall suggests the same clueless users would encounter the singularity and attempt defragging it probably won't help much
