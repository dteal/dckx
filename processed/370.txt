n this comic references brian jacques' series of books redwall which star sapient woodland animals in various high fantasy adventures the first panel shows the similarity between the story of martin the warrior from the book mossflower and aragorn from the lord of the rings by j r r tolkien the joke is that while martin and aragorn introduce themselves separately they then go on to describe their particular story which turns out to be exactly the same for both of them subsequently martin jinxes aragorn jinx is a common children's game which is initiated by shouting jinx after somebody speaks the same word or sentence at the same time as you that person is then jinxed with the usual rules dictating that they are then not permitted to speak until unjinxed by some specific action usually somebody saying their name martin and his sword was referenced again in 1722 debugging the second panel deals with the fact that redwall mentions the name of satan or the devil 4 times while it never mentions god or jesus randall then points out that people who protest against harry potter because of the series witchcraft should take note that redwall explicitly mentions satan although it has had little to no negative feedback from more conservative readers in the third panel randall comments on redwall's often used theme of critical messages being left in riddles throughout the abbey for the occupants to find when they are in need randall suggests that he would use public key cryptography to encode the messages instead of the elaborate riddles used in the books some of which are ridiculously easy which doesn't exactly make for good security when dealing with sensitive information in the title text randall jokes that he is making a crossover fan fiction with redwall and jurassic park redwall was also referenced in 1688 map age guide and 1722 debugging
