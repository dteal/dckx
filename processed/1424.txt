n two cueball like guys are preparing to fence but only the left seems ready he says en garde hence the title a fencing call literally meaning be on your guard from french the call is used to order the participants to take their position in a similar way to the xe2x80x9con your markxe2x80x9d command in racing the other two commands are xe2x80x9ctireurs xc3xaates vous prxc3xaatsxe2x80x9d xe2x80x9ccombatants are you readyxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9callezxe2x80x9d xe2x80x9cgoxe2x80x9d the right participant takes this to mean being guarded emotionally what are you thinking is a common question used to deepen a conversation typically between close friends or lovers the person being asked may take a moment to consider what they are thinking and whether or not it would be appropriate to share with the asker if the person being asked is emotionally comfortable with the asker they may answer immediately without fear of judgment or ridicule such a level of comfort between two people generally takes a long time to develop  after the right fencer has explained why he is always en garde the left fencer asks if could be a little less so but the answer is no since the right fencer acknowledges that he has been hurt before and thus makes it even more difficult for him to let down his guards obviously the right fencer has had bad experience from previous relationships maybe one where he was ridiculed after sharing his immediate thoughts the title text takes this further with the touch call used to indicate to a participant that they have been touched by their opponent's blade and therefore the attacker receives a point the right participant counters this claim by saying his emotions have priority or right of way implying he was blocking out parrying the touching feelings fencing right of way rules can make a move invalid when another move has priority but generally refer to physical actions on the participant's part
