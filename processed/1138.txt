n in the comic by comparing three graphs cueball comes to the conclusion that the audience presumably the owners/operators of our site should adjust their content or advertising to cater to martha stewart and furry porn fans the actual reason the graphs are same is they all match the population concentration in the us because there is no statistically significant relation between geographic location and any of the mentioned sub populations a heatmap the term having been coined and trademarked by cormac kinney is a graph showing three dimensional data on a two dimensional image with each pixel's colour representing the value of the data at that position  it does not necessarily have anything to do with heat but a heatmap may resemble a thermal image  in this comic red represents the highest numerical values then yellow and green with white the lowest values in all three maps the title text reflects a similar situation in world maps where the website written in english is read by english speaking users no matter the location because their isp and search providers direct them primarily to english websites so the visitors' geographic graph matches the graph of the global english speaking population
