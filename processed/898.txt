n the president of the united states is at the top of the us nuclear chain of command but the engineer is de facto above him because the engineer is in charge of configuring how the button works and thus could have installed an override so that he could block the president's use of the button and/or use it himself the red button is a simplification denoting procedures for the worst case scenario ie launching all strategic nuclear capabilities this paradoxical situation applies in many other fields in a major corporation commercially sensitive information is generally hidden from employees at lower levels but available to management but the systems administrator who usually sits low on the hierarchy and doesn't manage any other employees can access not only the sensitive information but the raw data that it's calculated from not only that but the systems administrator is usually responsible for controlling who has access to the information making him/her the most powerful person in the company as far as the it infrastructure is concerned many managers think of themselves as being above engineers and have trouble coming to grips with this concept themistocles mentioned at the title text was an ancient greek politician in the title text is a similar joke placed at the top of the chain of command this time in ancient greece it refers to plutarch's life of themistocles  of his son who lorded it over his mother and through her over himself he said jestingly that the boy was the most powerful of all the hellenes; for the hellenes were commanded by the athenians the athenians by himself himself by the boy's mother and the mother by her boy  the part about television advertisements is a proposal that by controlling the infant sons of important political figures as well as the aforementioned red button engineer one could control said political figures and thus the entire world dora the explorer is an educational show for young children something a busy man like the president or the  engineer might turn on for his/her child
