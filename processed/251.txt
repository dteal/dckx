n this comic refers to the behavior of a tray loading optical disc drive of a desktop computer when the tray is opened and the user is reaching for the disc a process or task on the computer can at that exact inopportune time request that the disc drive close its tray alternatively accidentally bumping the open tray may engage the auto close feature resulting in the same scenario  this results in a sort of tug of war between the user who is trying to remove the disc and the cd drive trying to retract and it is this tug of war that worries cueball or more likely randall that the robot war is impending the title text however points out that this fear is irrational not because we'll always be able to win the tug of war even if the computer reprograms itself to ignore our pull we are physically stronger than the retraction mechanism or because the act is ultimately pointless it's an indignant protest at best but because any robot war will necessarily have to start in the network to get any traction a robot war is a recurring theme in science fiction where humans develop robots that become self aware and start a war against humanity a well known example of this theme is found in the terminator franchise where as the title text suggests a military computer network skynet becomes self aware and starts a world war to kill all humans this event is also parodied in 1046 skynet
