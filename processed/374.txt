n black hat isn't the type of person to keep a journal so cueball is understandably surprised when he sees black hat's journal black hat lives up to his reputation though as it turns out that the journal is just part of a plot to hurt innocent preferably shy girls  he explains his scheme to cueball about how he sits in a train and writes in the journal while sitting across from such a girl his intention is to make eye contact with her only to look bashfully down this is construed to make her believe that he is an emotional guy that is embarrassed both about writing the journal but also because she has caught him staring he also tries to let her believe that he may be interested in her he is just waiting for her to start smiling and then he gets to the point of it all by rolling his eyes at her while giving her a quick glare only to resume writing he attempts to make her feel alienated black hat assumes that this feeling will stay with the poor girl for the rest of they day the only thing black hat gets out of this is the knowledge of having ruined the girls day as he says it's great cueball thinks black hat is sickening and exclaims that this is why we can't have nice people this is probably a reference to the meme this is why we can't have nice things  black hat excuses himself for doing this because it is so easy he mixes two different concepts together while doing so shooting fish in a barrel is an idiom describing an effortless or simple action with guaranteed success so that is easy pleasure the adding of lonely angsty makes the fish sound more like teenagers the girls black hat targets are probably best described as lonely angsty teenagers which may be a way to describe several young people and they are the easy targets ie the fish in the barrel for him to shoot and this is just so easy and so fun that he cannot help himself the title text implies that black hat actually does write in the journal filling it with the kind of things a nice guy like cueball might wish to say to a shy girl but that is only so he can burn it when it is full thus again cementing the fact that he is a complete sociopath  it is clear from the comic that he has already done this several time with great success but where this comic might be interesting in it self it was actually only the setup for introducing danish whom we meet for the first time in the second installment of the journal series of which this comic was just the first danish turns out to be a match for black hat in every way of the word if you want to see how black hat's scheme worked on danish check out 377 journal 2 released the following week after this one the whole journal story are  374 journal 377 journal 2 405 journal 3 432 journal 4 433 journal 5
