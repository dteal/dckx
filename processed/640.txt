n this is a play on the occupations/hobbies tornado chaser someone who instead of evacuating the area like normal people actually goes in to get a closer look at the tornado and big game hunter who often kill for trophies tornado chasers are typically but not always meteorologists here the tornado chaser actually hunts the tornado with a gun like big game the joke being that this is not possible in real life&#91;citation needed&#93; the f 3 is a reference to the fujita scale used to classify tornado intensity it goes from 1 to 5 with 5 being the highest with an updated enhanced fujita scale as mentioned in the title text being used in the us since 2007 the title text is an aside from randall saying that he finds the notation for the enhanced fujita scale ef # for example ef 5 for a level 5 tornado to be stupid and suggests that we continue to use the enhanced fujita scale to measure the strength of tornadoes but abbreviate it to f instead leading to the non stupid f whatever notation whatever signifying the number of the tornado on the scale
