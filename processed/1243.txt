n cueball is relating some odd news items to black hat a structure has been discovered that consists of large ring strung with superstrong mesh a 260 mile long pole 420 km and a gigantic winch as cueball outlines the particulars of the discovery black hat responds vaguely to each detail seeming preoccupied with his computer cueball quickly realizes that the pole ring and net combination sounds like a butterfly net but one of immense size given black hat's history of nefarious activities cueball infers and then accuses black hat of wanting to catch the international space station which orbits about 260 miles above the earth by winching the pole up so that the net aligns with the space station's orbit black hat does not deny the charge but he dissimulates by saying it is not necessarily the iss that he intends to catch just an international space station implying that it could be some other one however it is transparently obvious which space station he is targeting hint it is the only truly international space station it is actually called the international space station and it has an orbit that matches the length of the pole that was found the real buildings may belong to these structures  the giant ring from the first panel may be an allusion to the tevatron a former circular particle accelerator at the fermi national accelerator laboratory fermilab east of batavia near chicago illinois it is a 686 km 426 miles long ring giving it a diameter of almost 22 km 14 miles leaving plenty of room to catch the iss which is only 1085 m 356 ft in the longest direction similarly the gigantic winch in st louis may refer to the 630 foot 192 meters high gateway arch monument it is the tallest man made monument in the united states  even the rough south north direction of this building does match to this scenario because the fermilab is approx 240 miles north of st louis however it is an arch not a winch&#91;citation needed&#93;   the title text is a reference to how butterfly collections are usually presented the insects are mounted in glass display cases each skewered through the body with a pin and labeled the text is spoken by black hat who again tries to imply that he is not to blame as it may not be his collection of satellites perhaps he is just catching a space station for a friend
