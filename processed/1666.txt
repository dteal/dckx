n megan is uploading cueball's consciousness into a computer device attached to his head via a cap on his skull after the upload the computer seems to have stopped responding to inputs causing megan to conclude that the process has failed however cueball insists the transfer could have worked or at least gave the correct response although that response could also be from the transfer failing this is because that is the kind of behaviour he is used to experiencing from his own brain sometimes computers can seem to be frozen ie non responsive to any user input; but if left alone for long enough they sometimes snap out of it in fact it is impossible for a computer to determine for all cases if a program will eventually stop see halting problem the potential benefits of the fictional technology used in this comic are obvious and this type of transfer has been subject of various science fiction works it could allow for a form of immortality or serve as a backup for someone's mind in the title text cueball or randall indicates that this kind of non response from the brain or a computer is something he just experienced when trying to write a email and then failing to get started for 20 minutes while he ie his brain tried to decide the very important detail of whether to begin the email with 'hi' of 'hey' a detail that is really trivial as this has little consequence in any normal relationship with friends that you wish to email this informally
