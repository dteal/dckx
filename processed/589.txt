n when a group of people go together to any kind of event where they expect to drink alcohol and would like to drive to and from the event it is usual to select one who has to be the designated driver this person will then stay sober during the event and can thus safely drive the other people home afterwards disregarding how drunk the other people becomes however as this comic points out if it not a simple task of going from a to b and back all together at the same time then it becomes an complex problem that requires an intricate kind of strategy and logical thinking to solve and may need more than one driver in this comic cueball addresses his friends regarding this problem right before they enter a bar it seems they have already decided that one of the friends will be the designated driver but then cueball mentions that they will have to leave in two groups and for some reason one of these groups will need at least two drivers this is hard to explain see below under number of drivers so now they already need three designated drivers furthermore someone has to go and pick up another friend and also two of them have to leave earlier than the rest by 1000  in the third panel the situation seems to be illustrated three people are drawn outside the bar with three lines going to the bar so the number of lines leaving and entering each destination seems to represent a person each since the number of people leaving and entering each destination is the same this makes it seem like the diagram is intended to be accurate there are four people entering and exiting the bar and six people entering and exiting both the party and the dinner the confusing part of the diagram is that there are only three people at the bar to begin with not the four shown in the first panel it also seems strange that someone will go back to the bar and especially that another goes back to the dinner from the party it is thus not easy to make the diagram fit the description see below for a possible take on the chart but the general concept would be that some people meet at a bar before joining the rest of a group at dinner then later most of these move on to a party after the party or bar/dinner people are going to head home in different groups  the enormous complexities of planning who car pools with whom from where to where and when make an excellent logic puzzle and what is worse anyone who has to drive needs to stay sober so it is important to solve the puzzle before the drinking starts or else there will be too few that can drive or too many who never get to drink to make matters worse one of the friends complicates this already complicated logical puzzle by involving the classic logic puzzle of the wolf goat and cabbage in the last panel the guy is shown standing with a goat on a tether saying he can't be in the car with the wolf cueball is then brought to swearing over this the goat puzzle was also the subject of 1134 logic boat and this may go some way of explaining why there needs to be a number of drivers the title text makes it clear why ordering a taxi is out of the question as it would take money out of the beer budget of course it also cost money to use your own car for gas etc but when you already have a car it is always cheaper to use that than pay for a taxi
