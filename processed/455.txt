n black hat encounters a person who is wearing not one but two black hats black hat is not a person to be trifled with but from his reaction he apparently believes that two black hats represents a considerable danger to him if a black hat is assumed to be akin to a badge of rank then two black hats certainly is superior to him in the capacity and willingness to do evil  alternatively and even more worrying two black hats could be someone who has the desire and the ability to acquire black hats which he then wears like a badge of honor with all this in mind black hat edges away keeping two black hats in sight at all times title text is just  this may represent the slow motion pause during which black hat's nefarious life flashes before his eyes as he considers his impending doom it may also emphasize how the usually witty black hat is for once speechless  this is also similar to the title text in 412 startled where black hat also becomes the little one and with much focus on the black hat as in this comic as mentioned there such a short title text could be due to the fact that it's a somewhat surreal comic and any further commentary might have detrimentally brought it down to earth see also 82 frame with the same title text but no relation to black hats
