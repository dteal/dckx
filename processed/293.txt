n the title rtfm is an acronym for read the fucking manual which frustrated software manufacturers tell users when confronted with a simple question most likely answered in the manual however cueball encounters a similar situation with a 911 call in which the first question the 911 dispatcher asks is if cueball has read the toaster's man page man pages are the 'manual' for unix systems but only describe commands and library functions not hardware even if a man page existed it is unreasonable to require the user of a toaster to read the manual just to avoid being stabbed in the face the 911 dispatcher decides that as he has not read the man page cueball is not entitled to medical assistance and hangs up the title text refers to the popular phrase life's too short which asserts that because we only have a limited amount of time on earth and that time can pass by quickly we should make the most of it that could mean for example don't spend time reading the documentation unless you actually experience a problem the second part suggests that some people actually die because they didn't rtfm
