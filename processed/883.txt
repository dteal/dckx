n in medical examinations a doctor will sometimes ask the patient to assess their pain to give the doctor a rough idea of the patient's condition cueball is asked by doctor ponytail to compare the pain in his arm with the worst pain that he can imagine; however a one to ten scale is not useful for cueball because in his imagination the worst possible pain reduces him to a huddled ball and also rescales his current pain to a 1 apparently he has the capacity to imagine pain so intense that it dwarfs any possible real world pain thus skewing the scale and this is what his friend megan refers to when ponytail asks what is wrong with his imagination according to the official transcript megan is cueball the patients friend and ponytail is a doctor the title text further emphasizes that idea if the pain was higher than one on his pain scale it would already be so high that he would be reduced to uncontrollable screaming a similar doctor ponytail is shown in 996 making things difficult with megan and again in 1713 50 ccs along with both cueball and megan in 647 scary cueball as rob also ends up in such a huddled up position
