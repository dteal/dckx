n in the context shown the expression bear with me for a moment usually implies that two seemingly unrelated topics are in fact connected and the connection is to be explained later this is not the case in the comic cueball is in fact simply showing random slides which have no connection to each other by using the phrase liberally and never actually explaining the links it is suggested that a presenter can simply continue to show random slides for an extended period before anyone actually realises what is going on the title text refers to siggraph an annual computer graphics conference held since 1974 in 541 ted talk it is said that randall has been banned from siggraph and we can infer from this comic that he was physically thrown out of it another very implausible possibility is that randall is making the joke that people who attend computer graphics conferences are stereotypically not very athletic and therefore unlikely to be able to physically throw someone in addition the fact that cueball was attending siggraph is another joke neither the quantum hall effect a concept in quantum mechanics nor rainfall in the amazon forest have anything to do with siggraph's focus of computer graphics
