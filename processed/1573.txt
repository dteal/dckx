n ponytail presents her company's fy2015 fiscal year for 2015 budget for cyberintelligence but is then interrupted with a snide remark about the prefix cyber this comic illustrates that some organization spends obscene amounts of money on their cyberintelligence budget yet all that spending appears not to have informed them that the prefix cyber  fell out of fashion years ago that the prefix could annoy experts were already used in the title text of 1084 server problem the prefix cyber is derived from cybernetic which comes from the greek word xcexbaxcfx85xcexb2xcexb5xcfx81xcexbdxcexb7xcfx84xcexb9xcexbaxcfx8cxcfx82 meaning skilled in steering or governing cyberintelligence could also be called cyber spying ie spying in the digital world one of many new words with the cyber  prefix many were invented in the 1980s and 1990s following the example of cyberspace popularized by william gibson in 1982 if cyberintelligence departments were given names today they might be called internet intelligence virtual intelligence data intelligence or online intelligence departments this may be due to the fact that government organizations are typically named by middle aged or senior officials who are generally less likely to be familiar with the current trends in technology language they are more likely to stick to the words that were used when they first learned about the technology the title text continues the joke by implying the organization learned about the demise of cyber  yet failed to process or analyze that data it may also be a reference to the previous comic which was a link to a survey for xkcd readers cyberspace and cybernetics illustrated here are two of the most common words with that prefix cyberspace 6 times as prevalent as cybernetics at their peaks cyberintelligence is shown here cyberspace was used 4000 times more often although the more common spelling splitting it in two words cyber intelligence was 135 times more used than in one word but even combining these two versions cyberspace is still used more than 1700 times as often
