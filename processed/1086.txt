n this comic is based on a common belief/superstition that when someone's eyelash falls out that person can make a wish on it this comic appears to be a page from the fictitious wish bureau in charge of granting said wishes and of course the wisher is black hat and he has quite a few wishes most of them based on the previous wish a common trope in fiction is that wishing for more wishes is prohibited and for many of his wishes black hat attempts to circumvent that  january 9 that wishing on eyelashes worked this wish is pointless if wishing on eyelashes worked then this would do absolutely nothing because it already works and if it didn't then nothing would happen because wishing on eyelashes wouldn't work  january 12 a pony this wish functions as a test to see whether or not previous wish worked it can be assumed that it did as black hat then continued to make additional wishes wishing for a pony is a stereotypical wish made by very young girls; since black hat is an adult man with a very dark sense of humor the contrast is humorous it could also be a reference to mr krabs wishing for a pony on the spongebob episode christmas who  january 15 unlimited wishes this appears to have failed due to the typical ban of wishing for additional wishes in conventional folklore  january 19 revocation of rules prohibiting unlimited wishes an attempt to circumvent the ban in the previous wish   january 20 a finite but arbitrarily large number of wishes another attempt to circumvent the ban on unlimited wishes  january 28 the power to dictate the rules governing wishes yet another attempt to circumvent the ban on unlimited wishes  february 5 unlimited eyelashes this wish likely caused black hat to grow unlimited eyelashes which could be quite inconvenient and painful and yes one more attempt to circumvent the ban on unlimited wishes  february 6 that wish granting entities be required to interpret wishes in accordance with the intent of the wisher this wish is likely a response to the previous day's misguided wish it's actually quite a common problem that people making wishes leave them open for misinterpretation  february 8 that wish granting entities be incapable of impatience an attempt to prevent whatever being is powerful enough to grant wishes from becoming angry with black hat while he tries to manipulate the system  february 12 #1 unlimited breadsticks the first wish of this day seems to be a reference to the unlimited breadsticks offered at olive garden  february 12 #2 veto power over others' wishes a power that could be interesting to have it also very much fits with black hat's character  february 19 veto power over others' wishes and all congressional legislation an improvement of the previous wish this would be very interesting to have indeed especially if you are black hat because you could veto any federal law a power normally entrusted only to the president  february 23 the power to override any veto this wish would allow black hat to override vetoes which in addition to the previous wish would effectively make him control the us legislature and to some extent also all other governing bodies  notably the un where the veto powers wielded by the big 5 cannot be overridden and can have large impacts on global politics note that it will not allow him to turn laws off veto them and on again override the veto at any moment as once a bill becomes law it cannot be vetoed  without the ability to propose legislation black hat's powers are still limited the wish may also refer back to the february 19 wish by granting himself veto power over wishes black hat just made vetoes more powerful than wishes; now he is trying to control other people's vetoes as well lest they one up him  february 27 the power to see where any shortened url goes without clicking this wish relates to a common practice especially in tweets or other short length media where full length specific html addresses such as wwwsomewherecom/articles/specificdate/the pagehtml would not be feasible so a more compressed but nonsensical string of seemingly random characters is used which links to a link of the full text address this creates some problems for people who are security or privacy conscious and prefer to be informed beforehand where they will be traveling on the internet the use of shortened urls is also central to many types of trolls or practical jokes most notably rickrolling see https//wwwyoutubecom/watchv=i5mdnkv8dza for an example by directing someone to a different location than the link would initially suggest thus black hat might be wishing to be able to tell where the links go for the purpose of avoiding this sort of trolling  february 29 the power to control the direction news anchors are looking while they talk this wish likely appeals to black hat's mischievous side allowing him to cause news anchors to look at the wrong camera during live broadcast repeatedly switching to the incorrect camera would cause havoc in the studio additionally black hat may also attempt to get a news anchor fired by having them stare where they should not such as a female anchor's breasts  march 7 the power to introduce arbitrary error into nate silver's predictions a reference to nate silver who is a former writer for baseball prospectus working on predicting baseball players' stats and now writes for five thirty eight in which he predicts the outcome of elections based on polling data this would grant black hat the power to influence the result of elections this would tighten the black hat's control of the us even more  march 15 a house of stairs this wish refers to the lithograph  house of stairs by m c escher or perhaps another of his lithographs relativity  march 23 a universe which is a replica of this one sans rules against meta wishes another attempt to circumvent the rules against wishing for more wishes  march 29 free transportation to and from that universe while the previous wish appears to have worked black hat notes a problem with it he is still in our universe with no ways to get to the new one  april 2 a clear explanation of how wish rules are structured and enforced it appears that one or both of the previous two wishes failed so black hat tries to discover exactly what is offending the bureau having clear rules and how they work helps anyone finding loopholes in them  april 7 the power to banish people into the tv show they are talking about black hat is obviously fed up of hearing people talking about certain tv shows and would like to be able to banish them into the show thus prevent him having to listen to those people  april 8 zero wishes an attempt to hack the wish granting system by using a quite common vulnerability in input validation an unexpected value there may be multiple vectors this can work  in many computer systems 0 is reserved for unlimited  the number may be used as a divisor in some equation and this will make the system divide by zero and probably crash  there also may be an assertion like number of wishes granted == 1 which would fail again crashing the system  similarly if viewed as a computer system it is possible that the wish decrement is performed after the wish is granted thus resulting in either1 wishes another common placeholder for unlimited numbers or an integer overflow if the wish counter is stored in an unsigned integer; the overflow can result in an exception otherwise1 becomes represented as max_int 1 basically an arbitrarily large number  however it seems the eyelash wish granting system does proper input validation on zero because it did not crash or grant unlimited wishes this wish may also be a reversal of the january 9 wish black hat is attempting to win his game by introducing a logical contradiction if he gets zero wishes this is one wish granted; however if it is not granted then de facto he will have been granted zero wishes this is a common technique used in logical proofs to show that an earlier assumption does not hold in this case the possibility of eyelash wishing to work    april 15 veto power over clocks midnight april 15 is the deadline for filing income tax returns in the united states it may also be that black hat now in control of all human legislation is attempting to extend this to further control also rules of nature  in this case time the strange wording is likely to be due to black hat having consulted with the wish hacking manual he acquired april 2  april 22 a pokxc3xa9ball that works on strangers' pets a reference to the cartoon and video game series pokxc3xa9mon a pokxc3xa9ball can be thrown at a pokxc3xa9mon or in this case a pet that the pokxc3xa9ball thrower finds either annoying or cute to capture/contain it and/or achieve ownership of it unless cheats are used pokxc3xa9balls cannot be used on pokxc3xa9mon owned by other people in the pokxc3xa9mon games many players wish to obtain the often high level pokxc3xa9mon of npcs and black hat may also be interested in pranking other players by stealing their powerful pokxc3xa9mon this was later revealed to be one of randall's wishes in the title text of 1705 pokxc3xa9mon go  the title text is yet another mischievous wish the coefficients of friction though usually not noticed as they are unchanging are all important when performing physical activities xe2x80x94 imagine trying to play hockey on a field of sand or sprinting over a sheet of ice  in addition to the difficulty going where you want or getting any balls that might be in play where you want them to go in a changing friction environment angular momentum would also be very difficult to control note when black hat makes meta wishes no follow up wishes are logged  this would be logical as any wish made to test the meta wish would not involve the eyelash process  since the meta wishes failed no valid eyelash wish condition existed and the test wishes were not logged in the eyelash wish log
