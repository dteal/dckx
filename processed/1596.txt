n the first panel shows a rocket launch which is a critical point in any space mission before this moment there are years of hard work from a large technical staff and all that work and even lives could be destroyed in a second if anything goes wrong during the launch t minus 2 minutes means that there are only two minutes left before the rocket is actually launched so at this moment everybody is very nervous and worried about the launch going wrong other texts from the panel refer to the usual checks before the launch whose end is to ensure everything is ready in the second panel one of the people controlling the launch sees a cool bird on the live feed from the cameras controlling the operation this should be of no importance at all given the relatively much more serious matter of having years of work and possibly human lives at stake however the technical staff starts commenting on this cool bird and aborts the launch procedure as they are interested in the bird this behavior would be absurd in real life in the third panel the two controllers attempt to identify the bird; the one on the right guesses maybe it is a hawk since the habitat of hawks and vultures overlap almost entirely a birdwatcher is almost certain to accidentally confuse the two in their lifetime of birdwatching obviously having this knowledge of the habitat overlap the controller on the left asks if the bird was a vulture the controller on the right accurately notes that it probably was not a vulture since it is commonly known to ornithologists that vultures hold their wings slightly raised in a v when seen head on1 however this demands that the original sighting of the bird must have included a flight pattern in which the bird not only flew past the tower as stated but also flew towards the tower even cooler the title text goes on with the same absurd behavior the crew restarts the countdown to launch the rocket but only to follow the bird and get a closer look at it the original space mission the rocket was designed for is completely ignored this is even more absurd than the initial interest in the bird given that a rocket designed to enter outer space is ill equipped to try to follow a bird and maneuver at the low elevation and at the relatively slow speed of a bird this could also be a joke in the well known fanaticism of serious bird watchers who think nothing of spur of the moment day long road trips or flights in order to get to view an unusual bird the vehicle pictured is not clearly identified and it could also be totally fictional it could be the atlas v or the ariane 4 launch vehicle it also shows some similarity with the spacex falcon 9 heavy launch vehicle albeit with stubbier strap on boosters named after the falcon another bird of prey this would increase the absurdity of the situation the bird being referred to by the launch crew features as a mere mark on the comic strip consistent with scale against the rocket but they are obviously trying to start to identify the rough species or group it belongs to from the wing geometry the effortlessly soaring carrion seeking vulture and the hawk that often uses a swooping attack upon its prey typically having very different wing configurations as matches their evolved lifestyle
