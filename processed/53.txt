n this is the second in the my hobby series of xkcd comics this comic humorously compares the rules of light gun cabinet arcade video games with real life randall suggests that his hobby is going to drug busts with the expressed purpose of getting shot as an innocent bystander thereby causing the police to lose 100 points drug busts are events where police attempt to catch drug dealers suppliers and financiers in situations with enough evidence to convict them in the style of arcade video games being examined drug busts are usually depicted as chaotic events with villains innocent bystanders captives and allies popping up like spring loaded targets at a shooting range in a setting with lots of places to hide  if you don't shoot a hostile target sufficiently quick you will be shot so it is common to shoot the wrong targets to add extra challenge these games often deduct points xe2x80x94 or worse cause damage to the player character xe2x80x94 if the player shoots the wrong target this is often frustrating; not only does the player feel they have failed to judge their target properly but the wasted time can cause them to get shot by the real targets  obviously doing this in real life would be a really bad idea as the hobbyist would quickly be killed the title text refers to the game area 51 which was a popular shooter arcade game from 1995 although a console/pc game of the same name was released in 2005 area 51 was one of many cabinet arcade games which featured a light gun that allowed players to aim at the screen and shoot in a realistic control mechanic the title text confirms that the comic is referring to these light gun cabinet games specifically the title text of 188 reload references this strip
