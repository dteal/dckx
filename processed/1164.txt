n home alone is a popular 1990 film in which the child protagonist kevin mccallister portrayed by macaulay culkin is accidentally left alone in his house when his family goes on vacation and has to thwart a burglary all by himself in the movie mccallister comes up with a variety of ingenious traps and schemes usually involving jury rigged toys and household items to harass injure and eventually incapacitate the burglars which was the film's defining feature the film spawned a series of sequels 4 as of 2012 the first of which also starred culkin all with a similar premise to the original the scene depicted in the strip is an adaptation of an iconic scene from the first movie used heavily in advertising where mccallister hangs two paint cans in strings above the staircase and let them swing down to hit the burglars in the face on a more general level the films revolves around the classical trope with an underdog defeating a much stronger opponent the burglars through his own ingenuity to reboot the franchise would be to begin it fresh with some new ideas ignoring the previous continuity this became common with the present century examples rebooting home alone with reversed ages so that an adult protagonist uses his skills to harm children burglars would obviously spoil the basic idea and make a very bad family comedy on the upside culkin could again play the protagonist and get his career rebooted bad as such a movie would be joking about this luckily makes good black comedy
