n the comic plays on the idea that geeks and nerds will try to break into high security areas in order to challenge themselves instead of to steal things the vault is labeled unpickable as a kind of challenge to break into it while all the valuables are simply stored in a shoe box beside the vault to our knowledge a 24 pin dual tumbler radial hybrid lock would be too bulky and cumbersome to actually exist the key would be huge for one thing but in theory would be a remarkably difficult type of lock to pick the fused 17th pin means even with the correct key it cannot be opened it would be much easier to simply break open the safe with brute force than to pick it since the vault is nearly unopenable nerds and geeks would spend all their time on the vault and ignore the seemingly useless shoe box the title text continues the theme with an unsolved 5x5 rubik's cube to further challenge and distract the thief
