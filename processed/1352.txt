n cueball and the curious science girl walk through a landscape with trees in the background and with many small pools of water the setting of trees interspersed with these many small pools resembles the wood between the worlds a meta verse described in cs lewis's the magician's nephew; each pool leads into a different universe xe2x80x94 one of these is ours another is narnia and charn the world of jadis the white witch is also visited through these pools science girl asks about the time before the big bang cueball says he thinks there was no time before xe2x80x94 which is implied by most forms of the big bang theory but then they happen upon a cosmologist megan on a swing who has several other theories about the universe simply put the tire swing is a symbolic representation of our universe scientific observations tell us that both space and time began with the big bang ~138 billion years ago we don't know if there was such a thing as before the universe or what that might be the first 6 panels reference ongoing speculation about where the universe came from and why it even exists in the first place the last two panels relate to recent observations of the accelerating universe in which galaxies are now receding from each other at higher and higher speeds due to dark energy the swing itself is likely a reference to the cyclic model where the universe expands from a big bang then contracts back in on itself under its own gravity for a big crunch before bouncing outward again in another big bang and repeating the whole process on the other hand the swing is accelerating as the universe xe2x80x94 so it may also be a reference to the entire universe we are all trapped on this swing xe2x80x94 and it's accelerating for the layman and most scientists as well cosmology is pretty confusing as science girl states at the end to which the cosmologist just replies wheeeee and just enjoys her ride with this accelerating swing/universe another interpretation of the acceleration may referring to the physics of orbital motion in which a centripetal force is always causing constant acceleration toward the center of the motion the title text references questions about the shape of the universe and what could lie outside of it by the current understanding on physics laws we can't see outside of the observable universe but it's likely that the universe is bigger than this observable universe and uniform on large scale even though nobody can leave our own universe megan bets that such unknown worlds do exist because this universe is here and it must have come from somewhere xe2x80x94 like her tire the shape of our universe was visited soon after in 1365 inflation where we can see what the outer boundaries of our universe looks like science girl is seen later in conjunction with a tire swing in 1659 tire swing maybe she is preparing to become a cosmologist herself also this may explain from where the tire came from
