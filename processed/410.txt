n the math paper cueball is in the process of describing in this comic turns out to be nothing but an elaborate set up for a joke about imaginary friends by taking the concept of friendly numbers into the complex imaginary plane which comprises complex numbers that have both a real and an imaginary part see details below  cueball is challenged on this setup by his superiors specifically the cueball like guy sitting at the end of the table who look straight through his first line up for the joke and ask him directly if this is just a build up for this joke cueball tries at first to look like he has no idea what he's talking about then lowers his head in shame and finally tries to state that it might not be such a setup but it is too late now such a pun is both so obvious and so terrible that cueball's superiors deem that he should no longer have a license to math and they thus revoke cueballs math license of course you do not need a math license but that is part of the comic's concept along the lines mentioned here below and further elaborated in the title text it is a recurring theme in earlier xkcd comics that cueball or randall ends up being banned from holding presentations at conferences after a presentation turns out to be just an elaborate pun the title text takes the joke a step further with the added hilarity of making the audience question exactly how cueball/randall was able to work a striptease into a presentation about genetic engineering and astrophysical rocket study or possibly genetics and rockets into a striptease and then even manage to lose all three licenses in one go this is what tv tropes calls a noodle incident the whole comic is basically randall who makes the joke that cueball never got around to but packing it up so we think it is about something else randall has often made such feeble jokes but by putting them into a context where someone listening comment on how bad that joke is or have to explain the joke it somehow becomes alright and he can get away with these jokes anyway see for instance 18 snapple
