n a compiler is a program that converts code into machine instructions that a computer can run a pointer is a variable within a computer program that is used to reference a memory location a segmentation fault segfault is an error that occurs when a program attempts to access an invalid section of memory segfaults usually cause a program to crash in an ungraceful fashion and fixing them can be difficult contrary to the comic title segfaults occur during run time program lifecycle phase and as such are not associated with a compiler in the comic the computer starts talking to cueball and compares a segfault with the unpleasant feeling one gets when they experience a hypnic jerk the computer then tells the programmer to double check your damn pointers as segfaults usually arise from a program attempting to access memory that is referenced by an invalid pointer the title text references gnu style autoconf configuration scripts these scripts check certain features of the system they're running on in order to build a program correctly; for example certain systems expect system calls to occur in a specific way and the autoconf script will detect this and alter the program to match the expectation invariably and memetically these scripts include a check to determine whether the build environment is sane this actually checks whether the path to the current folder has unsafe characters and whether a newly created file is older than the script itself which could indicate a very esoteric filesystem a corrupted source archive or just a system clock that's set incorrectly; however since these file modification dates are an important part of how the autoconf script does its work it can't go any further in an insane environment in any case the joke is that an insane build environment is nothing like an insane person yet randall is equating the two
