n the caption below the frame tells us that cueball is afraid that if someone were to die unexpectedly then he is afraid that he will not be able to forget the last thing he said to that person in the comic panel cueball has observed a mess on the floor presumably cat vomit he asks the second off panel character who is leaving to pick up some spray cleaner that works on cat vomit cueball suddenly realizes that should the off panel character die on that errand that this would be the last thing he said to them panicking slightly cueball interrupts their departure and says something more appropriate as last words you are in my heart always the off panel character is confused by this statement not being aware of cueball's fear
