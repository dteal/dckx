n that's what she said is a phrase used in the us in response to an unintended sexual innuendo similar to the uk phrase said the actress to the bishop an example usage might look like the following  a while putting together some furniture i think this is too small b that's what she said  in this example the innuendo is that a was referring to a furniture component say a bolt too large to fit into the hole that was drilled in the factory but the phrase might also refer to a human penis while popular for a while the phrase is considered puerile and clichxc3xa9 nowadays so it isn't often used except in mockery  in this case no sexual innuendo is intended; instead the phrase is used to maximize the ambiguity of the statement ambiguity is when a statement could mean more than one thing in english it is usually created as a result of pronouns like he and they which might potentially refer to many different things in context here that's what she said could mean several things because that and she could refer to multiple parts of the sentence  some female said the entire statement some female said i could've done what they claimed i did some female is part of the they that claimed something about some other female some female reported that some unknown male doubts than another female did something that other people claimed that the other female or yet another female did  another explanation would be that the intense grammatical ambiguity of the situation allows for any type of interpretation of the situation even a more perverted interpretation taken more literally the she in that's what she said could be a hypothetical woman who is known for saying crazy things thus the grammatically ambiguous statement remind the speaker of this  hypothetical woman the title text turns this back around saying that there is actually a sexual innuendo in the statement apparently the girl in question said this during sex since all of these possibilities are highly unusual things to say during sex the observation in the second sentence is accurate one of randall's many hobbies
