n this is another strip in the my hobby series google glass is a set of glasses frames worn like typical glasses that features an optical display and internet connectivity it responds to voice commands starting with ok glass for example to initiate video recording or to check tomorrow's weather strangers and other people surrounding the user would often find it annoying to hear someone talking to himself or to glass also many people who buy the newest gadgets like google glass like to brag about it and thus would try to say ok glass so loud that other people will notice they have these cool new glasses this can be very annoying in general randall's hobby is saying ok glass before any sentence while he is only wearing regular glasses like here where he drawn as usual like cueball is checking tomorrow's weather not on the glasses but on his smartphone apparently this is even more annoying to the bystander than if he would actually wear a real google glass while saying so he thus both annoys other people mocks people who buy such glasses to brag about them and in general mock google glasses in the title text randall states that there is an extra benefit by doing this while only wearing regular glasses because when someone is finally fed up with the annoyance and rips the glasses off and stomps on them then it would cost much less for regular glasses than if he had to replace a google glass these are very expensive 1500 $ at the time of this comic at least according to the title text at least note regular glasses can also be very expensive but you could choose to wear your reserve glasses for such a prank the ok glass keyword is not useless outside of glass; in the browser chrome and the android/ios app google now ok glass is also valid instead of ok google to initiate a voice command while cueball may be using this app it is not necessarily the case given that the caption states that cueball enjoys prefacing everything with the phrase it seems generally that randall is no fan of google glass which was also shown earlier in 1251 anti glass google glass has become a recurring theme in xkcd
