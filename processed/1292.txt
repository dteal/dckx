n this is yet another of randall's compromise comics a few mathematicians argue as to whether to use pi which is the ratio between a circle's circumference and its diameter or tau which is the ratio between a circle's circumference and its radius some consider pi to be the wrong convention and are in favor of using tau as the circle constant; see the tau manifesto which was inspired by the article pi is wrong by mathematician robert palais others consider proponents of tau to be foolish and remain loyal to pi see the pi manifesto of course regardless of which convention is used the change is merely in notation xe2x80x94 the underlying mathematics remains unaltered still the choice of pi vs tau can affect the clarity of equations analogies between different equations and how easy various subjects are to teach most people know xcfx80 pi by the approximation 314 but do not know xcfx84 tau which by definition is twice as large as pi randall is suggesting using pau which is a portmanteau of pi and tau as a number situated appropriately enough halfway between pi and tau ie 15 pi or 075 tau but of course his number would be inconvenient as this value does not naturally turn up when working with circles or other mathematical constructs so there are no commonly used formulas that would use pau the title text claims that pau can be approximated by e+2 as both values are roughly 471 xe2x80x94 a similarity that holds little since it requires another irrational constant e it also attributes the nickname devil's ratio to pau due to the sequence 666 supposedly appearing four times in the first 200 digits of pau when expressed in the octal base however this is not the case and was likely due to an error in the computer system used by wolframalpha; for more details see below
