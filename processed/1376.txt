n cueball is presumably experiencing a common dream subject flying or floating as in many varieties of such a dream the ability to fly float or glide only gradually manifests going from longer and longer jumps to a sort of flight or hovering in cueball's case his jumps become longer and 'lighter' until at last he is gliding just above the surface of the earth he has apparently had such a dream before with just such a flight mechanic manifesting itself as he indicates that he 'loves' these dreams in his presumed dream cueball finally achieves his gliding flight just as he reaches the shoreline and his gliding carries him over the water's edge and out to sea after a moment's reflection he realizes that if he were really gliding out to sea without any real apparent means of control his situation would presumably be rather perilous xe2x80x94 death by starvation or thirst gradually slowing down and becoming 'stuck' over the water with no way to land the loss of his gliding ability as suddenly as it came etc all suggest themselves as possible perils he would now be subject to if in fact his 'dream' were actual reality thus he eventually indicates that he hopes it is a dream in contrast to his feeling at the comic's opening the title text adds a further worry not immediately apparent unless one considers the possibility that cueball's 'gliding' will continue in a straight line in relation to the earth's surface in that case he would continue moving straight while the earth's surface would curve away beneath him sending him out into space instead of the relatively preferable scenario of merely floating across the ocean to the opposite shore after all if the laws of physics had changed to permit hovering/flying consequences would be unpredictable xe2x80x94 ie there'd be no assurance one would maintain a constant hovering height rather than take leave of the planet as one flies forth one thing about miracles is that all bets are off also note that this situation is similar to the case of newton's cannonball however that is actually in very low earth orbit xe2x80x94 and you would need to be going 7300&#160;m/s or about 16000&#160;mph 26000&#160;km/h to stay in orbit at that speed of course air friction would quickly destroy the cannonball or person this is clearly not the case in the dream getting weightless and drifting around was a fantasy in 226 swingset the comic 417 the man who fell sideways has some resemblance to this one  in 942 juggling cueball throws some balls and later a book  they miss the ground in the book thing explainer cueball jumps to score with a basketball in the explanation for playing fields only to find that he keeps rising steadily along a straight curve up above the hoop very similar to this jump that just lets cueball float straight afterwards
