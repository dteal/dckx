n this comic is a reference to an old urban legend a guy is drugged then he awakes in an ice filled bathtub only to discover both of his kidneys have been harvested by organ thieves they have left him in the tub of ice to let him survive in time to get to a hospital for dialysis it is now his problem to get a new kidney whereas the thieves can sell the organs to someone who also needs a kidney transplantation by doing it in this way then the thieves prevent themselves from becoming murderers; thus if they get caught they might get a lesser sentence that would be the explanation why they do not just kill the organ donor in this comic the situation is reversed beret guy who has just bought some ice for the party he is about to return to is lured by danish up to her place where he is drugged the next morning he awakes in a bathtub filled with kidneys only to discover that his ice has been harvested by danish the title text refers to a similar story where the victim is left a note by their captor or one night stand that says welcome to the aids club rather than having been involuntarily infected with hiv/aids the victim beret guy has been involuntarily enrolled in the american automobile association aaa and his roadside assistance card has been left on the counter there could be another pun on the fact that beret guy's response to find himself in a tub filled with kidneys by yelling aaaaa seems to be a realistic one and thus this could also be another kind of aaa club he is welcomed to there is no display of typical beret guy behavior in this comic although it is typical for him to be involved in an incident that turns the world upside down his encounter with organ thieves only cost him his ice a party and that he got a nasty experience but he retained his kidneys and was not infected with hiv
