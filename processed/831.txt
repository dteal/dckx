n a weather radar is a device which uses the reflection of radio waves from rain or snow to detect where there is rainfall the information from the radar is then shown on a map in this case green means light rain while red or white represent very heavy rain possibly a thunderstorm these maps can be quite beautiful and mesmerizing to look at in this case the speaker who is located where the black dot is enjoys watching interesting unexpected events on the radar and is surprised to see a massive unexpected storm heading straight for him a storm indeed appears but splits in half and passes either side of him the reaction of the speaker seems to suggest that this has happened before the caption suggests that this happens when the people who run the radar notice you looking at the page enough they tease you by adding a fake storm coming towards you which then disappears just as it approaches the speaker the title text explores how our perceptions are often inaccurate someone may think that there are fewer storms than when they were young or that certain songs come up more often on their mp3 player even when they don't there are lots of these types of biases in judgement
