n weather forecasting is an extremely difficult task even if it is only for five days in numerical models extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity so most meteorologists only provide us with a five day forecast in this comic randall takes this to the extreme by first showing a five day forecast and then progressing to five month year million billion and finally trillion year forecast since the first weather symbol is the same in all six rows we must assume this indicates the weather today and not tomorrow or in a trillion years it is first in the second panel that we have made the first jump according to the label consequently the last column gives the predictions for four days four months   four trillion years from today when moving past the five days the forecast is just a qualified guess based on the time of year in a month it is christmas as shown in the second panel of the second row and then it is winter with january and february so snow is likely but certainly not something that happens on all days of a winter month looking at the five year forecast guesses are made as to what the weather will be like at the same time of year for these first three predictions the weather symbols are all of the same three types sun clouds and some kind of precipitation rain or snow and the temperature range from 21 to 44&#160;xc2xb0f  61 to 66&#160;xc2xb0c winter temperature then we go into the far future jumping a million year from panel to panel but still the weather symbols stay the same however in 3 million years time aliens or advanced humans attack with energy beams from something looking like  flying saucers they are gone a million years later the temperature range is still the same except that it rises to 52&#160;xc2xb0f or 111&#160;xc2xb0c a possible reference to global warming in one panel but then while the attack is going on the temperature rises to 275&#160;xc2xb0f 135&#160;xc2xb0c once we get to the billion year mark it actually becomes more meaningful to try to predict the weather because now we reach the times when the sun begins to change although the sun will continue to burn hydrogen for about 5 billion years yet while in its main sequence it will still grow in diameter as it begins to exhaust its supply of fuel the core will contract to increase the temperature and the outer layer will then compensate by expanding slightly this is what is indicated in panel two and three where the color of the sun changes towards red as the surface becomes less hot as it expands away from the center of the sun the temperature will rise on earth as indicated in the panels 105&#160;xc2xb0f = 405&#160;xc2xb0c and 371&#160;xc2xb0f = 188&#160;xc2xb0c so in two billion years the temperature is hot enough that all the earth's oceans will have boiled awayxe2x80xa6 actually this will happen already in about a billion years then once there is no longer enough hydrogen the sun will truly expand into a red giant this should not happen until five billions years from now &#91;citation needed&#93; but in the forecast it is indicated to happen already in three maybe this is randall taking liberties to show what happens during this phase which would not fit into a five billion years forecast alternatively it is just indicating how uncertain these kind of forecasts are or a statement that we may not know for certain that it will take five not three billion years disregarding this the fourth panel shows the temperature at earth's position inside the red giant sun the color of the panel indicates that we are inside the sun the temperature is 71488106 degrees fahrenheit 39715597 degrees celsius the current temperature of the center of the sun is only 27 million degrees fahrenheit 15 million degrees celsius and although that may rise by a factor of ten during helium fusion then that will only be at the very core and not out in the solar atmosphere reaching out to earth here the temperature would only be of the order of thousands of fahrenheit since the sun's outer temperature decreases as it increases its diameter so this panels temperature also makes little sense it may involve some ambiguities regarding what the forecast means; the edge of the red giant sun is predicted to be somewhere near the current orbit of earth but the position of the earth could change the most likely prediction at the moment is for earth to move outward but if the planet is engulfed by the sun it would spiral inward and at some point fall apart so in some sense here for the forecast could become a position deep inside the sun where core temperatures could reach 100 million kelvin the red giant phase only last half a million years so a billion years after the sun has been a red giant its outer atmosphere will for sure have disappeared leaving only a white dwarf to cool down given randall's version of this time schedule then it will have had about a billion years to cool down but would still likely be the brightest object in the sky as seen from where the earth once was it is not indicated in the last panel where we just see other stars of the galaxy the temperature is down to that of the background radiation today this radiation has a temperature of 272548 kelvin =2704245&#160;xc2xb0c =4547641&#160;xc2xb0f so this is a few degree f colder than what is shown in the comic which states the temperature is452&#160;xc2xb0f = 426 kelvin this higher temperature may have been chosen to reflect that even the star light from other stars would increase the actual temperature in the last panel with trillion years we jump right past the sun's red giant phase to a panel looking much like the one after five billions years with only other stars over the next three trillion years the stars become fewer and fewer and dimmer and dimmer as they run out of fuel and fewer new stars form after four trillion years the background temperature even decreases one degree to453&#160;xc2xb0f as the universe keeps expanding and the wavelength of the radiation does the same thus decreasing its temperature the title text is a play on comments referring to fast changing weather on a more ordinary human timescale such as mark twain's quip if you don't like the weather in new england now just wait a few minutes a ten days forecast was used in 1245 10 day forecast in 1379 45 degrees randall looked at the weather over long periods of time as well
