n this is the first of two comics in the android series which continued directly less than two weeks later in 600 android boyfriend cueball shows off his new android girlfriend megan to his cueball like friend who asks if the android is a sex bot the android responds by pulling a cherry stem from the friend's drink and inserting it into her mouth so far the action appears to be an emulation of the party trick where someone puts a cherry stem into their mouth and ties it into a knot in order to suggest tongue dexterity that could be put to good use in kissing and oral sex however instead of tying the cherry stem in a knot the android activates an arc welder built into her mouth which presumably reduces the stem to ashes the friend proclaims that that trick is definitely not sexy but then the android aggressively approaches him reaching out and saying remove your pants the friend not eager to experience close genital contact with the arc welder sensibly refuses of course he may also not wish to take of his pants in front of his friend at a party with drinks and presumably other people; or perhaps he do not wish to admit that he actually does find the arc welding act sexy the title text bounces a few implications around developing robots with the capacity to either learn or feel emotions is an ethical factor and practical consideration that is commonly explored in science fiction here it's proposed that robots programmed for sex would have their emotions set to enjoy sex by default but then use their capacity to learn to develop preferences on what kind of sex they want to have this is potentially a psychological issue mainly as to whether or not it would be considered unhealthy but more directly it's a customer satisfaction problem what if a sexbot were to develop sexual fetishes that its owner finds unappealing
