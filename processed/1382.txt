n in the early 20th century visions of the future usually stipulated that everyone would travel around with rockets strapped to their backs however this has not come to pass in this comic randall is pointing out that the problem with personal rocket packs more commonly called jet packs is not how to attach a rocket to someone's back but other practical considerations one might be how to keep the hot exhaust from burning the user's calves many jet pack designs actually do have ways to deal with this such as moving the rockets farther from the user but there are many other practical issues which have made this an impractical form of travel given current technology the title text starts with the trope i want my jet pack it continues with pointing out that if people did start using rocket packs there would also be more injuries raising health care costs that's something that people usually don't consider when imagining a future where these devices are commonplace so this year when the comics was published the demand was   'it's 2014  i want my jetpack and also my free medical care covering all my jetpack related injuries'
