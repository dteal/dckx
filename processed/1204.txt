n google earth is a mapping software service provided by google that allows people to view the earth from above if zoomed in to maximum magnification one can obtain clear views of individual streets and homes an image's resolution is the smallest length detectable in that image in terms of google earth this refers to the real life distance corresponding to one pixel in an aerial image randall points out that the level of detail in google earth's images has been increasing exponentially since its introduction as aerial imaging technology improves and better ways of collecting the data are found each tick in the scale represents a resolution improvement by 1000 times in quantum mechanics the planck length is in layman's terms the smallest measurable distance defined as approximately 16xc3x9710xe2x88x9235 meters or around 1020 times smaller than the diameter of a proton as the graph indicates this may be called the resolution of the universe randall extrapolates the exponential trend of google earth's increasing resolution 'revealing' that by the year 2120 or so google earth's resolution will approach and even possibly exceed the planck length an obviously fanciful and impossible idea current laboratory instruments cannot even get close to measuring the planck length barely able to reach the level of the atom other comics exploring unwarranted extrapolation include 605 extrapolating 1007 sustainable and 1281 minifigs the title text refers to controversy that google received at one point regarding their use of vehicle mounted street view cameras to take images of streets and houses and how such photography could constitute an invasion of privacy google defended itself by stating that the cameras can see nothing more than a pedestrian walking by given the trendline in this comic however google would need to produce resolution in the nanometer range by 2031 which using today's technology would require the use of scanning electron microscopes the same 'invasion of privacy' defense would obviously not work here as 1 current scanning electron microscopes in labs can only be used with small specimens at very close range and are completely unsuitable for observing something as large as a house or for observations from a passing car and 2 most pedestrians are not equipped with scanning electron microscopes &#91;citation needed&#93;
