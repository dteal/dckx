n both megan and cueball are agonizing over what to get each other for valentine's day both panic and do weird things at the heart of the way they are acting is the prisoner's dilemma which has been referenced before in xkcd the prisoner's dilemma is a canonical example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two individuals might not cooperate even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so wikipedia has a great example of prisoner's dilemma which illustrates it very well  two men are arrested but the police do not possess enough information for a conviction following the separation of the two men the police offer both a similar dealxe2x80x94if one testifies against his partner defects/betrays and the other remains silent cooperates/assists the betrayer goes free and the cooperator receives the full one year sentence if both remain silent both are sentenced to only one month in jail for a minor charge if each 'rats out' the other each receives a three month sentence each prisoner must choose either to betray or remain silent; the decision of each is kept quiet what should they do  in this way both cueball and megan are kept separate each not knowing what the other is going to do for valentine's day in the valentine dilemma as it is named in the title of this comic and both do weird things for valentine's day which ends up being the perfect result to the valentine dilemma as both end up with the same level of weirdness and don't go for the grand gesture the title text combines the two dilemma scenarios in an absurd juxtaposition with the reader you choosing from the valentine's day gift no gift dilemma and the other person choosing to betray the reader in an armed robbery case
