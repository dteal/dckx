n the collatz conjecture is a longstanding unsolved problem in mathematics it states that repeating the sequence of operations described in the comic will eventually lead to the number 1 the description in the comic starts out accurate then veers into the joke the comic illustrates the sequence with a graph in which an arrow connects each number to its successor for example the number 22 is even so the next number in the sequence is 22 xc3xb7 2 = 11 and there is an arrow from 22 to 11 on the other hand 11 is odd so the next number is 3 xc3x97 11 + 1 = 34 and there is an arrow from 11 to 34 according to the title text cueball is obsessively writing out the graph by hand and is so preoccupied with the task that he has stopped socializing with his friends he will be busy for a very long time because the collatz conjecture has been confirmed for all starting values up to 5 xc3x97 1018 the strong collatz conjecture in the title text is a humorous extension of the collatz conjecture some other mathematical conjectures and axioms also have normal and strong variants where the strong variant gives a more general rule this practice is further parodied in 1310 goldbach conjectures
