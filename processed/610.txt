n the people in this comic think of each other as sheep who blindly follow direction without thinking for themselves the word sheeple from the title has been used before in xkcd in the phrase wake up sheeple in this comic each person on the train considers themselves to be the only individual mind and everyone around them as sheep ironically the reader can see that although each of them thinks about how individual they are they are all collectively thinking exactly the same thing the comic can also be taken as a warning to not assume that you have more consciousness than someone else since for all you know they could think the same about you ayn rand was a russian born american novelist and activist whose most famous books include atlas shrugged anthem and the fountainhead she developed a philosophy known as objectivism which promotes individual fulfillment or so called rational self interest at the expense of collective goals and undertakings sheeple coordinates with ayn rand's novel anthem set in the distant future in which the word i has been abolished and the evils of the communal values have created a new dark age a possible further irony can be found in the title text rand enthusiasts would seek individualism and independence from social pressures; however a convention could be interpreted as a social collective of people who have similar interests in a subject these ideas could arguably be construed to be opposites of each other however similar interests does not mean lack of individualism this can be seen in ayn rand's novel atlas shrugged which features a society of like minded people centered around the concepts of individualism and neoliberalism
