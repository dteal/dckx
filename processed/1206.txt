n in this comic randall is playing with the notion that since einstein contributed so much to society and many of his works have withstood testing disproving einstein must be a difficult task this is proven false by taking a mundane declaration by einstein and proving it false with a simple task nobel laureate and time person of the century albert einstein is often considered one of the smartest and most influential men in world history his theories have revolutionized our understanding of the universe and inspired generations of scientists in this comic cueball indicates to a friend that he is working on an experiment that may disprove einstein the implication is that cueball is conducting a serious scientific experiment which may disprove one of einstein's scientific theories the second frame however implies that the einsteinian theory cueball's experiment may disprove is an offhand and subjective remark by einstein about the availability of good sandwiches the experiment cueball is currently conducting probably refers to the fact that he is currently eating a sandwich and if that sandwich was indeed a good one einstein would be proved wrong part of the humor here is that cueball's friend probably assumes that when cueball says currently he means the experiment is part of cueball's work not what he is doing at that exact moment in 947 investing randall comments on how people put too much credence in a joke einstein made in passing and in 799 stephen hawking we see stephen hawking in a similar predicament every word he says taken as a major declaration the title text demonstrates the ability to disprove einstein while not challenging his scientific work but rather one of his decisions in his capacity as a patent clerk at the swiss patent office at the time he published his first major papers previously alluded to in 1067 pressures according to the einstein faq on the swiss federal institute of intellectual property's website patent #39561 is one of several patents that we can assume  were personally examined by einstein a pdf of the patent which was indeed a gravel sorter trommel can be found here in german
