n there's a somewhat well circulated image on the internet entitled the world according to americans which plays on the stereotype of the ignorant american in it the entirety of eastern europe and most of asia are entitled commies and the middle east as evil doers and so on later other people created similar maps to re do the concept it later spread to other cultures  this comic is an anti joke playing on that idea you expect to see something which plays on the stereotypes that exist in american culture of various parts of the world however instead the map is remarkably well informed and shows how sampling bias can be used to conflate results the title text explains that the people who were interviewed had studied for a geography bee see below the table of items in the map the title text jokes that in fact the only reason that the map is fairly well annotated is that the group of people labeling it were actually on the way back from a geography bee competition this could add weight to the 'ignorant american' stereotype as these individuals should know more than the common person although as the illustrators wrote below cape horn the reason they did not draw antarctica or many south american middle eastern and british countries and the lack of detail may be because the people who asked them to draw this map was beginning to 'look impatient' since they did not get the expected ignorant result a landlocked country is a country that does not border any major bodies of water furthering the concept a doubly landlocked country is a country that not only has no connection to water but is only bordered by other landlocked countries as the title text states there are only two such countries in the world as of 2012 uzbekistan and liechtenstein this is the type of fact that may be stereotypically expected of a geography bee competitor
