n this comic is a homage to charles schulz the creator of the comic peanuts who was born on november 26 1922 both comics carry the idea that when you start thinking about your tongue you can hardly stop thinking about it similarly if you start thinking about your breathing you stop breathing unless you consciously think to breathe this is similar to the ironic process theory where trying to not think about something will invariably make you think about it the intention of black hat in this comic is for cueball to consciously feel his tongue for the entire month of november since it was black hat's idea black hat probably suffers the same consequences   here is the comic in question by charles schulz from peanuts    a random person on tumblr speculates that schulz's comic has a deeper meaning about becoming conscious about one's existence in the world this is similar in concept to the expression and phrase used for trolling in online communities you are now breathing manually
