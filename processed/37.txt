n this is the first my hobby comic in xkcd in these comics randall suggests an obscure activity or pastime he enjoys which he declares as his hobby in the premiere my hobby comic randall's hobby is mentally re interpreting what people mean when they say adjective ass noun by moving the hyphen to after the word ass instead of before the semi scatological suffixass is used as an intensifier in informal us english speech usually attached to an adjective directly modifying a noun as in big ass car or funny ass comedian in this comic cueball is exploring the increased humor aspect of changingass from a suffix modifying the adjective to ass  a prefix modifying the noun yielding a big ass car or a funny ass comedian the former presumably being a large car for carrying buttocks the latter being a humorous comedian specializing in jokes about lower backs the prefix ass  may also have a negative connotation indicating that something is disliked an ass car may be a very terrible car for example another explanation would be that since this suffix/prefix refers to an element of human anatomy the car would be in the shape of said anatomical piece outside of north america most english speakers use arse to mean the buttocks so to them it may sound as if randall's talking about donkeys on an interesting note; there really is such a thing as an ass car
