n while the comic is ostensibly about grad students it is really randall's way of poking fun at the relative rigor of different fields reminiscent of 435 purity in the comic cueball attempts to pose as an expert in a given field a recurring pastime of his and sees how long it takes before the real experts detect his nonsense the first panel shows cueball discussing an engineering problem with ponytail ponytail is talking about an immediate practical problem involving heat dissipation cueball suggests 'using logarithms' to solve it; logarithms are a mathematical tool used for expressing an exponential relationship as a linear one while logarithms have many uses in engineering they are an abstract mathematical concept and not a method of dissipating heat&#91;citation needed&#93; so in the context of the conversation it makes no sense and outs cueball as having grabbed a random word he knows engineers use and thrown it in to sound smart with the engineer's conversation focusing on an immediate practical application it only takes 48 seconds before he exposes himself the second panel shows a conversation with linguistic grad students who are apparently discussing the finno ugric language family a family of related languages that includes hungarian finnish and estonian cueball asks if klingon is included in this family since klingon is a constructed language designed to sound alien and to avoid sounding like any human language it cannot be part of any real linguistic family most linguists would instantly recognize the meaninglessness of the statement which he has made after only 63 seconds of conversation in the third panel the humour comes from the fact that the idea of sociology existing to rank human beings on some arbitrary intrinsic value is not only ridiculous scientifically but also politically offensive cueball unknowingly recreates the logic behind some of the worst crimes in human history a problem sociologists are trained to be very aware of however it may be something that a less educated non sociologist would assume could pass within the field when he describes his unscientific and offensive approach we see one of the sociology grad students facepalming in exasperation because a non expert may be able to sound somewhat educated in sociology before making such a slip up it is four minutes into the conversation before he is detected in the final panel he attempts to pass as an expert in literary criticism this field notoriously uses a great deal of impenetrable jargon so when cueball makes up seemingly meaningless sentences no one notices his quip at deconstructing the self may be a meta joke about the field itself failing under deconstruction or this sentence may be a meta meta  example of someone applying literary criticism standards to the analysis of this specific comic we find that rather than being caught out within minutes as in the other fields he has now published 8 papers and 2 books the humor comes from the fact that he has accidentally made himself into a recognised authority in the field despite not having any idea what he was talking about in this panel cueball is sitting in an armchair in the position of an expert lecturing to a student who sits at his feet apparently absorbing his inane statement this implies that the field itself has published a great deal of meaningless things that only superficially look meaningful through the impenetrability of the jargon the title text challenges the audience to take a look at the wikipedia article for literary deconstruction if they don't believe this criticism applies the wikipedia article in question is almost constantly flagged for cleanup on the grounds that it's a jumbled mess an archive of the article as it was when this comic was published is available here
