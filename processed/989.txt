n megan holding a smartphone tells white hat that everyone now carries a computer in their pocket and refers to how it is always on line connected and is full of sensors like orientation vibration and gps etc this is actually amazing and white hat assumes she is overwhelmed and ask her if the development is changing too fast for her but it turns out that megan is actually disappointed about the pace of technology's improvement it goes too slowly who isn't disappointed from old sci fi movies predictions we should by this point have flying cars and the flying skateboard like in back to the future 2 or a hyper technological future like in blade runner she tells white hat that she has  decides to cryogenically freeze herself now that she has developed cryogenics hence the title far enough for humans to survive such a deep freeze and then she climbs into her homemade chamber and plans to skip 30 years ahead in time  cryogenic freezing is the ability to freeze oneself so that one does not age and doesn't experience the passage of time it is common in fiction as a useful technology for long space flights or other necessary preservation like in the film 2001 however to megan's chagrin when she wakes up she is told by cueball who is not terry that all the other scientists and engineers that were fascinated about the future have also frozen themselves using her technology even building their freezing chambers in a line to either side of her chamber so nothing has been invented while she was frozen  but as can be seen in panel four and as cueball tells her they are all waking up now implying that finally something new can be invented but megan then immediately decides to try again to see what happens next hoping the situation 30 years later will be different but then the guy in one of the nearby chambers gets the same idea as she did again however if everyone does the same thing again the situation will repeat itself and nothing will ever change again as they can continue this process in 30 years step note that this is not time travel but still related to this recurring theme in xkcd and similar methods have been called time travel in xkcd before like in 630 time travel and especially 1617 time capsule it seems however that the engineer in the nearest chamber to megan's right spots this problem and tries to stop all the other engineers from freezing down again as he says wait guys  the morale of the comic is   don't freeze yourself engineers and scientists we need your help  the title text refers to tech startups and existing tech companies who often use bold marketing techniques proclaiming that they are going to 'revolutionize' not only a particular product or service but every facet of a users lives one of the cliche phrases used in presentations is welcome to the future implying that their product is the only way forwards and all others are rendered obsolete  in the title text this cliche is turned on its head when randall tells about a very short lived tech startup he tried to get going the reason for the short live of the company was that it admitted that nothing changed with it's slogan  'welcome to the future nothing's changed'  technology by its nature tends to evolve and improve and thus a tech company which doesn't change will fall further and further behind their competitors likely ending up going bust which was the case with randall's fake tech startup
