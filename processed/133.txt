n the comic's title is a reference to the well known poem the raven by edgar allan poe one of the most popular pieces of poetry in the english language the comic quotes the first eight lines of the work in which the poetic persona perceives a strange knocking on his door in the middle of the night unlike the original the comic reveals the nocturnal visitor to be the rapper eminem this unexpected turn reflects the ambiguity of the verb to rap in english according to the merriam webster dictionary the word was used in the original sense of to strike as early as the 14th century the meaning of the word was later extended to talking freely and frankly in this purport it was especially employed by the black rights movement during the 1960s cp for example the nom de guerre of h rap brown the hip hop subculture which had its roots in the aforementioned movement finally adopted the term in the sense of rhythmic speaking or chanting today the word is almost exclusively used with the latter meaning it is thus implied that the poetic persona in the comic hears eminem performing a rap song rather than someone knocking on the door as in the original note also that rap music is usually considered fairly aggressive which seems to contradict the poem's description of a gentle sound beyond a linguistic interpretation of the comic it may be added that rap music and poetry bear a lot of similarities some of the more advanced rap lyrics feature classical stylistic devices like alliterations or inline rhymes as well as a more or less complex metrical structure the meter of a classical poem on the other hand gives the piece a distinct almost musical rhythm albeit it is not accompanied by any instruments nerdcore rapper mc lars has recorded a rap version of the poem with some additional lyrics and modern references added called 'mr raven' which can be heard here for a comparison between the verbal capabilities of edgar allan poe and eminem see this article the raven is heavily referenced in popular culture interestingly enough the webcomic dinosaur comics had a reference to edgar allan poe three weeks before the xkcd comic was published there is also a penny arcade version of the raven trope the title text besides defending the graphic style of the drawing also lampshades at the somewhat peculiar taste of fashion found in the hip hop subculture in the picture eminem wears a sleeveless hoodie while the aesthetic value of such garment might be disputed it certainly defeats the purpose of keeping its bearer warm
