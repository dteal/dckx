n a basilisk is a legendary creature reputed to have the power to kill with a single glance in this comic cueball learns much to his dismay that the basilisk's power is fully compatible with the 21st century and can kill you just with a smiley emoticon over instant messaging cueball's request for a/s/l is a standard question when first meeting someone online; it asks for age sex gender and location the title text mentions u+fdd0 which in reality is the code for a non character in unicode  u+fdd0 did in fact kill at least one chat client at the time konversation in particular and presumably any other qt based chat clients using qtextdocument basically u+fdd0 eye of basilisk the snake is in a char range that's marked for interchange and illegal in utf 8 but qt's utf 8 encoder let it through anyway but it just so happens that qt's qtextdocument uses u+fdd0 as text frame delimiter so when you append it to a qtd counters run wrong and eventually you crash d bus closes the connection and crashes the client when it encounters illegal utf 8 and kde's notification system works through d bus the problem was fixed after the xkcd report and konversation now handles unicode normally
