n a genetic algorithm starts with a set of candidates and evaluates them the best candidates are combined and randomly mutated to form the candidates for the next generation after being allowed to proceed for an extended period a genetic algorithm can often produce remarkable results if the initial candidates are randomly generated as appears to be the case here the initial generations are usually horrible in the comic the computer science cs department is the host of a dinner party they choose to create a genetic algorithm to generate their recipes based on the remarks of the second diner this is probably not the first generation and the results are still horrible the host of the party is so enamored of the promise of the genetic algorithm that he fails to take into account that it will be several years before the recipes become remotely good the title text could make reference to the fact that genetic algorithms will sometimes return results which are highly abnormal and vastly deviate from what we would think to be selected for but nonetheless can be quite successful albeit unorthodox it also showcases that the algorithm has stumbled upon a recipe that engages in wordplay with the movie and common phrase dazed and confused
