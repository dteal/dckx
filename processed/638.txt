n this comic is a commentary on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence the ants' dialogue describes the narrow scope of their search a few tiles and only looking for pheromone trails and thus they conclude that there is no other intelligent life the irony is that humanity does of course exist but were simply not present in the kitchen at the time of search nor do we communicate with ant pheromones similarly our ability to search outer space for other life is limited to our ability to detect specific modes of communication ie radio waves and to the very limited area of space imposed by technological limitations on transportation range and sensitivity of our equipment the title text refers to the kepler mission to discover extrasolar planets in august 2009 a couple of weeks before this comic the first results of this mission were released which showed the spacecraft to be healthy and had detected a known exoplanet no new science results would be released until november of 2009 which randall was anticipating this mission has found more than 2700 planet candidates that still have to be confirmed by other telescopes so that's the difference to the ants as of august 2013 two reaction wheels heavy metallic discs that can be spun to impart angular momentum to the probe mounted on the major axis; an alternative to reaction thrusters which require a depletable supply of reaction fuel on kepler have failed causing nasa to change the mission though it will still be looking for planets with its two remaining wheels the second part is a bait and switch joke; by calling the search for extrasolar planets the second most important thing our species has ever done it creates the expectation that the first most important thing will be a monumental breakthrough such as for example the concept of language instead the title text ends up just revealing that randall likes having pizza delivered
