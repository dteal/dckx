n this comic was posted right after the weekend on a monday so it was on time to emphasize that we all hate mondays in the first image there is a reference to the lover boy song everybodys workin for the weekend; both the song and the panel refer to how most working and middle class people are constantly focused on merely surviving until saturday with enough energy to relax properly  cueball then goes on to state the fact that any calendar used is just a social consensus and since nature doesn't know the day of the week he simply suggest making this monday into a saturday actually why not make all days into saturday to have eternal weekend when you actually stop and think about the speech the argument turns into utter nonsense simply renaming every day on the gregorian calendar to saturday doesn't actually do anything and the first saturday of the week would carry the exact same stigma as monday furthermore if cueball is proposing to abolish the work week entirely the economy would collapse within days this fact may explain why the last panel is drawn in negative with the background black it gives a very ominous feeling to the last remark  no confirmation has yet been found that any of these words are references to something from former us president james garfield or to garfield the cartoon cat who are the two speech writers mentioned in the title text however garfield the cartoon cat has a bunch of different images emphasizing the greatness of the weekend and bemoaning the existence of the first day of the work week monday and hence the title text suggest that this speech was written by garfield the cat and that this would be a better speech than any delivered by james garfield
