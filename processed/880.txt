n some people suffer from headaches eyestrain motion sickness and other problems when watching 3d movies playing 3d games watching 3d television playing hand held nintendo 3ds etc in this comic cueball is using the excuse that 3d gives him a headache to get out of going outside into the real world where everything is in 3d instead he stays inside and looks at his 2d computer monitor in the title text he says he will only go to flat places ie places where everything he could see would be 2d like this comic was released on april fools' day the april fools joke for 2011 made every comic on the site 3d thus forcing people like cueball to endure 3d even at their computer screens the 3d view is still available at xk3dxkcdcom for all comics prior to this one
