n the comic roughly parodies a situation in which two characters are seeing who can wait longer to get the result they want however in the comic the model sailing ship is not alive and doesn't experience time except perhaps if it absorbs water and falls apart or beaches once the water in the bowl evaporates the comic compares the patience of a boy with that of an inanimate object also it could imply that the boy has too much time on his hands like many of the earlier comics some of this comic's humor comes from the surreality of the situation the gravity of the boy's statement is juxtaposed with the insignificance of a child's toy floating in a bowl of water on one level the absurdity of this is funny in itself; on another level the audience is invited to imagine what might possibly be going through the boy's mind to make him take this toy and bowl so seriously alternatively the comic can be taken to recognize the mortality and ultimate fate of death/decay for both the boat and the boy creating a grim moral but if one goes deeper into meaning one could realize that the comic itself is humorous for trying to make a fatalistic statement using a boy and a toy boat still making the comic ultimately humorous in the original quote for this comic see trivia randall states that this is not the barrel boy this is not only because they have a similar hairstyle since the barrel boy was floating on the water in a barrel and this boy is looking into a bowl not barrel filled with water it would be easy to draw some parallels it was obviously important for randall to make clear that there were not such connections
