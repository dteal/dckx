n the comic is based on the lord of the rings specifically a scene from the fellowship of the ring where the eponymous fellowship is trapped outside the door to the mines of moria there's a spoken password to open the doors an elvish inscription on them provides a clue speak friend and enter the party leader gandalf initially interprets this to mean that a friend could speak the password and enter only after many unsuccessful efforts does he realize it is actually a very simple riddle the password is the elvish word for friend mellon and the inscription should in fact be interpreted as speak out loud the word mellon the elvish word for friend and you will be able to enter see the wikipedia article usexe2x80x93mention distinction in this comic cueball white hat and megan reenact the scene with cueball taking the role of gandalf the doors apparently open off panel when the password is spoken white hat then wonders aloud what the elvish word for frenemy is and cueball postulates mellogoth this is a portmanteau of mellon and goth much like how frenemy is a portmanteau of friend and enemy the elvish word root goth is best known as part of the name of morgoth literally black enemy of the silmarillion the doors apparently immediately slam shut the moment cueball says mellogoth it is unclear whether this is because the opposite of the password has been spoken or because the doors take offense to the word/concept frenemy of which xkcd has previously made fun in 919 tween bromance the title text ponders what would occur if the sirannon a stream running adjacent to the path leading to the doors were to be completely blocked with the doors left open the already partially blocked sirannon had formed a pool before the doors; which contained some sort of monstrous horror from the depths of the earth referred to as the watcher in the water randall seems to think that the pond draining into the mines would connect the watcher with another horror within the balrog a low level servant of morgoth living within the depths of the mines balrogs are primarily creatures of fire and shadow so having a bunch of water dumped on it is unlikely to please it but may weaken it he then goes on to wonder about the outcome of a battle between the two monsters
