n this is the third entry in the ongoing xkcd phone series which parodies common smartphone specs by attributing absurd or useless features to a fictional phone in the table the features are explained in order from the top left going clockwise    feature  explanation   2 aa batteries not included   a phrase usually shown on small low powered electronic devices like remote controllers and not on cellphones; which use lithium ion batteries and need to be constantly recharged for continuous use the apparently thin phone according to the scale as judged by the wristband would also preclude inserting aa batteries unless a protruding battery compartment is hidden out of view on the back of the phone alternatively could mean two anti aircraft artillery batteries which would be groups of light or medium artillery pieces or missiles 2 to 9 weapons per battery depending on country weapon system and organisation in any case they would badly hamper the portability of the phone    boneless   reference to meat or fish products being boneless ie having all the bones removed making it convenient to cook or eat unclear why a phone would be boneless since it is mostly inedible perhaps a reference to the person trapped inside having their bones removed to make them easier to fit inside or stating that the phone is flexible a possible reference to the iphone 6's reported problems with its chassis where it could bend under pressure likely a reference to bone conduction microphones implying that needing bones to work is a disadvantage and this phone has the feature of being boneless xkcd phone 4 was instead seedless    ear screen   an overcomplicated term for a speaker connecting a screen which emits light to send visual information and the portion of a speaker which vibrates to send auditory information comparing the two makes a speaker a screen for the ear   heartbeat accelerator   a mashup of heartbeat sensor and accelerometer may be some sort of external pacemaker if that's the case it's worrying that it only accelerates potentially causing a positive feedback heart attack it may also be the result of the phone being so exciting or frustrating that it increases its user's heart rate   mobilepay money clip   while mobile pay is a form of payment involving electronic transfers via cellphone this model includes a money clip; a way of holding physical bills together which defeats the purpose of electronic payment whether this is a clip that transfers money digitally or the phrase mobile pay is just a marketing tag is unknown   siri or whoever it was we put in here   a joke on intelligent personal assistants it also jokes that siri and the like are actual people trapped inside of phones   instead of being on surface only screen goes all the way through   a reference to surface screens possible reference to smartphones with screen display wrapping one or more edges like samsung galaxy note edge or samsung galaxy s6 edge or dual screen smartphones with screen on the back usually e ink like yotaphone 2 or smartphones with minimal bezel like eg sharp aquos crystal screen going all the way through would leave no place for innards of smartphone processor battery etc and unless each layer is designed to be semi transparent to see the inner voxels the inner displays would be unseeable anyway    theknotcom partnership phone licensed to perform wedding ceremonies and does so at random   theknotcom is a website that assists in all stages of wedding planning due to this partnering the phone has apparently obtained legal status as a justice of the peace capable of performing legally valid marriages it exerts this capability randomly however so the phone's owner or potentially any other unsuspecting bystander could suddenly find themselves with a new spouse without their knowledge generally an undesired effect&#91;citation needed&#93; whether this would result in unintentional bigamy or if the phone restricts itself to pairing up singles or even enacts divorce first if necessary is left unclear may be a reference to how same sex marriage was fully legalized in the united states just two weeks prior to the release of this comic   fingerprint randomizer   presumably randomises the user's fingerprint which may or may not be inconvenient depending on the intent of the user it is not clear whether the device will change the person's fingerprint into a human like fingerprint that is randomly selected from all possibilities or if it completely mangles the fingerprint of the user either way physically altering the user's finger to this degree will likely involve a painful process likely a cynical reference to fingerprint scanners which are touted as password replacements   usb e hotswappable   a usb port that makes fun of the three current systems a b and recently c by skipping d completely and jumping to e the port presumably charges the phone and allows to transfer files like normal but this kind lets you perform hot swapping replacing computer system components without turning the system off with it which has always been a feature of usb so mentioning it is redundant at best may be a reference to the esatap power over esata hybrid port that is functioning as a usb and esata port at the same time the serial ata bus interface has standardized hot swapping support    waterproof but can drown   perhaps a reference to siri or the person trapped in the phone drowning but the phone itself staying functional this is another human like function which the first 2 xkcd phone comics had   foretold by prophecy   likely mocking people on the internet who attempt to predict when apple will release their next device might also be a joke on many videogames or fantasy novels in which the main character is 'the chosen one' because 'the prophecy' foretold it   runs natively   usually a description given to ported software as this statement doesn't make any sense when referring to hardware notable exceptions to the norm are few and far between when software writers would like to run their apps on multiple platforms they usually have three choices re compile the source code into each platform's codebase often requiring tweaking to handle practical differences in resources between the systems; use a specially 'pre portable' code that you can write once run anywhere such as java but requires a suitable interpreter to be written for each platform and may still require code tweaks to absorb differences in implementations; create a specific emulator/virtual machine to allow existing code to 'see' the platform it was written for despite the underlying system only the first option is 'running natively' often the most optimised and thus best performing option and is usually qualified such as runs &lt;software name&gt; natively for particular packages full compiled upon that platform it would also make little sense for the os itself to be non native except when intentionally emulating another system ideally on a more powerful system that can power past the inefficiencies of conversion and translation or in this case it may be that the phone has legs and can literally run    wristband   probably mocking trending smart watches this feature would not be very useful on a full sized smart phone as it would be uncomfortable to wear due to its size also possibly a follow up to xkcd phone 2 being described as a 'phone for your other hand' as the wristband would make it possible to have all three phones accessible at once   wireless discharging   many modern cellphones feature wireless charging which uses electromagnetic induction to charge the battery of the device this model apparently uses the same technology to discharge the battery; which of course is something undesired as one needs the battery's energy to run the phone may also refer to the standard behavior of the phone's antenna which communicates wirelessly via em radio waves but discharges the battery in doing so it could also be simply and literally describing the nature of all cell phones and indeed all battery powered electronic devices to gradually use the battery discharging when there are no wires attached wireless since wireless also means no power cord is plugged in and assuming the absence or non use of the aforementioned wireless charging function which this phone may not even have  depending on the avenue of discharge this may also be related to the heartbeat accelerator accelerating the user's heartbeat by shocking them   magnetic stripe   likely a dig at the nfc near field communication wireless radio modules in many modern phones nfc allows among others functions mobile payment this magnetic stripe could be a cheap way to imitate payment functionality but compatible with classic credit cards magnetic stripes are a data storage method used by devices such as credit cards and key cards to hold and transfer small amounts of information like key codes usually cellphones don't have them as they utilize more robust and protected ways to store and transmit data such as nfc the magnetic stripe shown would likely be unusable with current magnetic stripe readers due to the phone's thickness in contrast to that of regular cards thus breaking all imagined 'compatibility' arguments it would also be very annoying as it seems to block part of the screen   the phrase we made another onexc2xaexc2xa9xe2x84xa2 is a reference to how phone companies release new phones very often and the trademarks that surround the phone itself the title text is a joke on guarantees and customer service usually the advertisement says that if the customer is not satisfied with the product they'll refund the money and take the product back at no additional cost in this case they guarantee the customer they'll send him/her home without charge; implying they won't fix or refund anything or that due to anticipated but unspecified faults of some kind the phone's owner will need help to get back home when things go wrong and probably be thankful for such assistance in yet another example of a worryingly non specific 'reassurance'
