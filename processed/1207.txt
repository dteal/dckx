n upon being asked by cueball black hat reveals his new 'business' airaware he explains it uses a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle uav that flies and records a person's daily schedule if that person either deviates forgets an appointment or tells somebody incorrect information the drone alerts the 'client' with an annoying wrong cueball is skeptical of the 'business plan' and questions its potential black hat expands saying that his intention is not personal profit and he is simply releasing them himself cueball starts to argue that it is not a business since there is no monetary gain before being abruptly interrupted by the airaware drone declaring that his previous sentence was incorrect this implies that black hat's business is not for profit; it's just another one of his sadistic schemes to torture people although the wikipedia page for business states that a business may also be not for profit this isn't really relevant as 'making money' and 'making a profit' are different things it would be better classified as a different type of organization or even as a hobby google now is software by google shipped with newer android devices it shows you important information when you need it like traffic on your way to work or home and upcoming events from your calendar it also reminds you when to leave in order to reach an appointment in time in the title text black hat has modified this to tell you when you're too late to get there instead it can also refer to a bug in google now which is that google now incorrectly calculates the time you have to leave and it always calculates that what it calculated will be 1 minute too late so it shows the transportation mode you selected will not let you arrive on time almost always unless you refresh an alternate explanation for the pronouncement of wrong by the quadcopter in the last panel is that it is referring to the plethora of companies in the electronic era and even today that don't actually make much or any money but are still considered successful businesses
