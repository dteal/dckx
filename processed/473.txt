n this comic shows cueball and his significant other undergoing a domestic dispute the debate is heated enough to tear apart a romantic relationship and although the end result is cueball being thrown out of his other's house he resolves that he will stand by his point of view no matter what of course in the last panel we learn that the argument is over something that should be in the context of romance utterly trivial cueball has been thrown out simply because he believes that pluto should never have been a planet pluto was the ninth planet in our solar system between 1930 and 2006 during a time when planet had no formal definition jupiter was thought to be the ninth planet from 1807 to 1845  in 2006 the iau created a formal definition for planet; pluto didn't make the cut and was swiftly reclassified  as a dwarf planet the reasons are complicated but the basic issue is that like ceres pallas juno and vesta pluto is too small to function as a planet in the solar system  here is a good explanation in the title text the airplane/treadmill argument starts when someone asks whether an airplane can take off while it is on a treadmill that is opposing its progress pulling it backward the question usually leads to arguments because it is posed ambiguously properly defining the question shows that the airplane can indeed take off because its forward motion is provided by its propeller/jet engine not its wheels which are free to spin at any speed and experiments such as mythbusters' bear this out randall also takes a crack at the issue here and more info can be found here the statement about being wrong is likely a reference to 386 duty calls
