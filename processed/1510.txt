n napoleon bonaparte was one of the greatest military leaders in history conquering most of europe in the space of a decade in 1814 after being forced to abdicate as emperor of the french he was exiled to the island of elba however in february 1815 napoleon escaped back to france quickly raised an army and overthrew the bourbon restoration monarchy for a period known as the hundred days at the end of this period actually lasting 111 days napoleon was defeated by british and prussian forces at the battle of waterloo and surrendered a month later this time he was exiled to saint helena an island much more remote than elbaxe2x80x94in fact one of the most remote places on earth in reality napoleon made no serious attempts to escape saint helena although admiral thomas cochrane reports in his memoirs that while on his way to lead the fledgling chilean navy in their revolution against spain he intended to stop at st helena in order to free napoleon and put him in charge of all the south american rebel armies in the event before he arrived at the island he learned that napoleon had died there six years after his surrender however this comic imagines a world in which napoleon escaped once again swimming back to europe saint helena is 2000&#160;km 1200&#160;mi from the afro eurasian landmass making such a swim rather implausible especially considering the ball and chain around his ankle and napoleon is depicted fresh out of the water suggesting that he did not simply swim to africa and make his way back to europe but rather swam straight to europe a journey of roughly 6100&#160;km 3800&#160;mi the comic implies that napoleon proves impossible to confine despite escalating attempts to send him to more remote locations and apply increasingly confining restraints handcuffs then adding a ball and chain on one ankle then chaining the ball to both ankles and finally adding an electronic legband in addition to being able to swim impossible distances he seems to also somehow escape imprisonment in the ice of antarctica he also seems to be immortal or well preserved by the ice of antartica remaining alive and apparently in great physical condition while nearly 200 years old the final panel shows us president john f kennedy's we choose to go to the moon speech but implies an alternate ending to the line not because it is easy but because it is hard rather it appears that we choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it will be hard for napoleon to return the title text is an apparent conversation between president richard nixon and an aide nixon is asked what we will do if we fail to maroon napoleon on the moon and replies have safire write up a speech this is a reference to nixon speechwriter william safire who wrote the draft speech in event of moon disaster to have been delivered by nixon should the apollo 11 astronauts be stranded on the moon this comic thus proposes an inversion of the actual scenario&#8212;instead of nixon delivering safire's speech because someone's been stranded on the moon in this comic he'd be delivering it if someone weren't stranded on the moon in event of moon disaster was also the topic of 1484 apollo speeches published two months before this comic
