n geocaching is a sport where you have to find things hidden by other people based on geographical coordinates randall has had a similar idea before in 201 christmas gps geohashing is a sport created by randall based on reaching a random location determined by an algorithm that uses a hash function that involves the current date location and the dow opening price the dow jones industrial average is a stock market index dealt in new york city the algorithm is built in a way that  makes it impossible to plan a meeting in advance because of the dow changes every day gathers people that are nearby everyone within the same 1xc2xb0xc3x971xc2xb0 grid square gets the same position  the algorithm works as follows   take the current date in the format yyyy mm dd  and append the most recent opening value for the dow jones industrial average  pass this string through the md5 algorithm   divide the hash value into two 16 character halves and convert each half to a decimal  take the integer portions of your current coordinates and append the decimal hash values  md5 is a cryptographic hashing algorithm and converts plaintext data into a seemingly random 128 bit 32 character string a good hashing algorithm should have three main properties it is non reversible and you cannot generate any plaintext data back from the hash a given sample of data will always produce the same hash value but even a tiny change to the original plaintext should produce an entirely different hash the example co ordinates are for the google headquarters in california as you can see here 37421542122085589 while geohashing was originally intended as a joke there are people who geohash regularly please see the link to the xkcd wiki above
