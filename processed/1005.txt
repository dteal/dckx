n sopa the stop online piracy act and pipa the protect ip act were a pair of controversial bills being considered by the united states government in late 2011 and early 2012 the bills contained the ability for the us government to deny american internet users access to certain sites at a judge's request these would be activated if the government could prove to a court that a site was primarily used to harbor illegally distributed copyrighted goods such as video games music and tv shows many people considered this to be censorship and were concerned that this could instead be used by larger corporations to squelch smaller competing sites who may not have the resources to challenge a take down notice in court should judges continually agree with the larger corporation as the bills gained infamy online many popular websites and web comics participated in a mass protest on january 18 2012 to announce their displeasure with the bill in an attempt to convince the house of representatives to reverse their judgement which had at the time been considered likely to pass if drafted  this was xkcd's participation in the protest randall discusses below the black panel that if he was having better copyright protection with these new acts then he would never have gotten this popular since his fans would not have been allowed to distribute the comic gaining him new followers  in typical xkcd fashion this comic contains several layers of depth that may not be immediately obvious to the casual observer in this instance the apparently solid black region contains a hidden image revealed with simple brightness+contrast manipulation or simply loading the image into microsoft paint and using the fill tool with black hat saying a message from sysadmins everywhere seriously don't screw with dns if you break this internet we are not making you a new one this stems from the fact that sites could be ordered taken down by allowing manipulation of the dns itself effectively making a site completely disappear from the web this court enforced dns manipulation was considered by many technical professionals to damage the underlying structure of the internet as well as potentially criminalizing recent work to improve its security  the image text referred to a common theme across protesting sites a blackout of the internet sites such as google changed to a black background while wikipedia prevented access by linking their sites to a black page with white text explaining their participation on the day of the protest xkcd was similarly blacked out with all comics redirecting to this one after the protest the bills were postponed from being drafted on january 20 2012
