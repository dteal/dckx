n the floor is lava is a game many kids play where they pretend the floor is lava meaning that they can't step on it or else they'll get 'burned' in this comic the three kids are taking this game too seriously causing great damage to the house with what appears to be a garden hose and some dynamite stopping a lava flow by diverting it into an artificial trench or cooling the flow with seawater are both tactics that have been used in the past with varying success see  1 the title text refers to events like the 2010 eruptions at eyjafjallajxc3xb6kull the ash clouds of which caused the shutdown of most of europe's ifr airspace the first joke there is that grounding a child often means to consign him to his/her bedroom for a set period of hours as a punishment whereas grounding a plane means to disallow any use of that plane for an extended period of time the most notable example of this is concorde which has been indefinitely grounded the second joke is that causing panic and diverting a large number of flights would cause lots of financial damage and would normally be subject to more punishment than simply giving the kids a time out
