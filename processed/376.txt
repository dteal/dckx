n in computer systems time is measured starting from some arbitrarily chosen point that particular time is known as the epoch for that system the unix operating system internally uses an epoch of january 1 1970 and measures the time as a number of seconds from then since this was intended only for things internal to the os file last modified times and the like using 1 jan 1970 was safe as no unix systems existed before that date dates before 1 january 1970 are represented by negative values commonly known as the year 2038 problem at 031408 on 19 january 2038 the 32 bit versions of the unix time stamp will cease to work as it will overflow the largest value that can be held in a signed 32 bit number the 64 bit version will expire at 153008 on 4 december 292277026596 cueball has clearly misused the system date in some way his friend makes a pun by combining epoch with epic fail a colloquial term meaning a very big mistake was made the title text takes the joke to the next level claiming that the entire universe began when unix did and therefore no one can be older than 38 at the time of the release of this comic 2008 this would now be 46 as of 2016 the formula is 'current year 1970' which would explain the bug since no earlier dates would be needed this is also similar to last thursdayism
