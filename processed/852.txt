n cueball explains in the first panel that the centrifugal force not be confused with the centripetal force which is made clear in 123 centrifugal force cited in the first frame of this comic along with variations in the earth's shape causes the gravitational force to vary by half a percent between some cities these variations could have a significant effect on certain sporting events; for example cueball explains that a pole vaulter might jump 2&#160;cm higher in a city with a smaller gravitational force so cueball writes an article reevaluating pole vaulting world records based on the city in which the record was accomplished his article suggests that some athletes should not have received an award for breaking a record because they did so in a city with a below average gravitational force these pole vaulters whose records were questioned by cueball's article angrily stage a protest outside of cueball's apartment then cueball proceeds to taunt them reasoning that they can't harm him because his building is locked cueball and megan then hear a crash indicating that the protesters have managed to reach the apartment's balcony when cueball asks out loud how the pole vaulters reached the balcony megan stares at him for a moment and then he realizes the stupidity of that question the pole vaulters pole vaulted onto the balcony  at the title text randall explains that in fact the gravity force at the olympic games at rio de janeiro in 2016 compared to london in 2012 will make a difference of more than one centimeter mainly because rio de janeiro is much closer to equator than london resulting in an increased centrifugal or perhaps centripetal if you prefer to be more contrasting force
