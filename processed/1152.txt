n this comic plays on the christian doctrine that the holy communion bread and wine are jesus' flesh and blood it is based on the words of jesus from the synoptic gospels and paul's first epistle to the corinthians during the last supper today used by the priest as words of institution according to the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation as well as in the eastern christian tradition the substance using the aristotelian concept that all things have an accidents or physical make up as well as a substance or true nature/purpose of the bread and wine change to jesus' flesh and blood while their accidents remains the same many people including many catholics believe this concept means the bread and wine literally turn ie their accidents changes into jesus' flesh and blood during the ceremony some protestant denominations reject this doctrine both its actual and misunderstood application with some taking the words as wholly symbolic of jesus' sacrificial death and others believing the bread and wine create a real spiritual connection to christ but do not change their substance  in the second panel danish accurately describes what would happen at a traditional christian christmas service though in such a way as to make it sound macabre after walking and thinking in panel three she makes it real macabre when worrying that they again may have gotten hold of the wrong child for the sacrifice needed to drink blood and eat flesh the title text further spoofs the common understanding of the doctrine of transubstantiation and elaborates on danish's concern in the last panel by supposing that the act of taking a sip of wine during holy communion turns that wine into the blood not of jesus but of a decades old murder victim  alternatively the title text could be interpreted as saying that the wine actually acquires jesus' dna and that jesus was killed in the 1970s  the police who investigated jesus' 1970s death would then have his dna on file
