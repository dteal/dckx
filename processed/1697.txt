n the linguistic processes of lenition weakening and fortition strengthening refer to a sound becoming respectively either more or less vowel like intervocalic means between two vowels an unvoiced consonant like f in between two vowels which are almost always voiced is more noticeable and takes more effort to pronounce than the voiced version v of the same sound in that position so a change from v to f in this context would be an example of fortition as a rule however lenition is much more common and in fact one of the most common regular changes observed across languages is the kind of lenition that is the precise opposite of cueball's prank an unvoiced consonant between two vowels comes to be spoken over time as a voiced consonant such as the middle consonant in the word butter that in american english is now pronounced as a brief alveolar tap xc9xbe rather than t observing a pattern of fortition rather than lenition in that position especially for just one particular consonant would be a very puzzling phenomenon to future linguists examples for the suggested change are  beafer instead of beaver nofember instead of november luffing instead of loving  in some languages like german and dutch v is often pronounced like f but it is not always the case the title text refers to the fact that english phonotactics tend to discourage final or unstressed /xc9x9b/ exceptions tend to be monosyllabic interjections such as   meh  heh  eh  yeh  the word 'meh' is an interjection used to express boredom or indifference the suggestion that it was originated by the writers of the animated tv show the simpsons is incorrect however its use surged in popularity following its use in various episodes of the show beginning with the 1994 episode sideshow bob roberts this is the second time in 2016 that randall tries to spread linguistic misinformation the first being 1677 contrails but since both are in the my hobby series it is not so strange
