n the wright brothers are orville and wilbur wright who are credited with the invention of the airplane and  the first controlled powered and sustained heavier than air human flight in 1903 cueball mentions to megan that the wright brothers would sometimes argue each other's point during debates in order to encourage a more balanced debate xe2x80x93 presumably so both brothers would explore all of the arguments on both sides megan is initially against the idea stating that treating emotionally charged personal issues as if they were academic debates would not work cueball argues that it would force each person to consider the other's point of view however when megan then reconsiders accepts his argument and appears to agree that they should try it cueball abruptly switches his position to thinking that it's a terrible idea the joke is that once megan agrees with him he employs his wright brothers suggestion and takes her initial position that the idea was bad thus the two have switched their arguments and are now exploring the other sides they may continue in this way to form a well balanced conclusion on the proposal or continually switch sides without ever concluding the argument the title text suggests that randall may have invented the fact that the wright brothers used this technique just so he could make the joke in this comic
