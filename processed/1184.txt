n the circumference c of a circle is 2xcfx80r where r is the radius of the circle randall then makes a footnote about r using 2 this creates a typographical ambiguity since a superscript 2 can also be an exponent as in x2 the comical purpose of this ambiguity is that the formula initially makes an appearance of a mistake and confusion with the formula for the area of the circle a = xcfx80rxe2x80x892 if and only if the reader realizes that the superscript text is a reference to a footnote will they understand that the author has in fact supplied the correct formula the title text makes a related joke randall has used rxe2x80xb2 r prime and rxe2x80xb3 r prime prime typically pronounced as r double prime the title text can be explained thusly like many symbols prime has widely differing meanings depending on context in mathematics prime is often employed to distinguish corresponding components in analogous systems for example in a description of a basic physical system if the velocity of an object is denoted with the variable v the velocity of that object at time=0 may be denoted with vxe2x80xb2 playing off this use of prime randall has selected the radius of earth prime a concept used in speculative fiction with parallel universes and multiple earths earth prime is our earth or at least the earth from which the protagonists originate however other disciplines use prime to mean other things in timekeeping and navigations xe2x80xb2 denotes minutes fractions of hours or degrees respectively and xe2x80xb3 denotes seconds fractions of minutes in the united states and some other places not using meters to measure distance xe2x80xb2 denotes feet and xe2x80xb3 denotes inches the suggestion of using rxe2x80xb2 or rxe2x80xb3 does not cause any mathematical confusion but using the former to denote the radius of a specific object and the latter to denote a radius using a specific unit of measurement would be highly esoteric 2 these are not intended to indicate the presence of a footn oh never mind
