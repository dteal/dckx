n children's fantasy stories such as the chronicles of narnia and the phantom tollbooth involve a kid who is magically transported out of their time to some fantastic realm goes through trials and becomes a hero and then is returned to their own mundane world at about the same time they left with no one else realizing or believing what happened to them the growth of the protagonist often involves learning self confidence the comic illustrates this type of story and considers what the rest of the child's life would really be like as they reach adulthood if they tell their friends spouse and family what happened to them no one will believe them and these loved ones will think them a bit crazy if they don't tell anyone they are pretending that the episode never happened either way it seems this would not be an enjoyable experience to live with for their entire adult life the title text continues the thought by pointing out the impossibility of contributing anything to the scientific world after visiting a magical world as the child would know many scientific baselines and indeed most regularly practiced scientific theory to be false but would be unable to say anything or convince anyone of what they knew
