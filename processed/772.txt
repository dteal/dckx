n frogger is a classic video game introduced in 1981 the aim of the game is to safely get a frog across a busy road and a river to a lily pad at the top of the screen  the title text reveals that a team of programmers misinterpreted a task to make the game more realistic ie better graphic and instead made the trucks swerve to avoid the car sized frog causing a car to crash into the truck resulting in a serious car crash instead of the cars just continuing to move at a constant rate in straight lines disregarding the movements of the frog the game continues to introduce increasing drama with the off panel bystanders this is similar to the idea behind the modification of the game in 873 fps mod which also turns the played from a violent game perhaps randall was inspired by this robot chicken sketch
