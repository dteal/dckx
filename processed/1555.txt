n this comic is a continuation of 1253 exoplanet names and was published the day after nasa announced the discovery of a number of planets including a planet called a cousin to earth kepler 452b black hat proposes naming it pluto to commemorate the flyby of the dwarf planet of that name by nasa's new horizons earlier the same month he admits this alternative to end the discussion about the status of pluto which is subject to debate among both scientists and laypeople over whether or not it should be considered a planet pluto was considered a planet for a long period of time until in 2005 the international astronomical union iau created a new definition for the word 'planet' designed to exclude pluto and similar objects resulting in much debate the iau is the organization that takes responsibility for naming celestial bodies like planets stars and much more  it may appear that with black hat's suggestion the answer to the question is pluto a planet will therefore always be yes regardless of the status of the pluto in our solar system according to the iau however the same iau official definition that excludes pluto also states that a 'planet' has to orbit our sun so according to the iau nothing in this comic is a planet the iau definition only allows them to be exoplanets which like dwarf planets are not planets hence the debate indeed becomes 'a little more confusing' this is in line with black hat's characterisation as a mischief maker the title text is referring to the planet name entry netherlands vi for the star epic 201912552 randall thus continues his references to the dutch people taking over the world and then the universe after the earth's oceans has been drained and transported to mars this happens in two consecutive what if's drain the oceans and drain the oceans part ii was referenced in dropping a mountain and was referenced again the week before this comic in 1551 pluto due to a drain in the earth's ocean the netherlands does not have to worry about getting flooded anymore and since it now does not have to use all its resources preventing floods it can use these to conquer the world including antarctica becoming south netherlands then it takes on mars which becomes new netherlands and then a section of pluto again calling it new netherlands there is also a possible reference to 1519 venus but that comic has no direct relation to the conquests of the dutch people like in the other three references it should be mentioned that new netherland was actually a dutch colony with new york city formally known as new amsterdam as its capital so the name new netherlands is historically correct while netherlands vi isn't  in the title text randall mentioned that he will continue with this netherlands joke driving it so far into the ground ie way beyond the point where it stops being funny that they the dutch people will have to build levees or dykes around it to keep the sea out thus making it funny again by forcing the dutchmen to build new levees for this reason the whole issue with their conquest of the world will be over before it happens
