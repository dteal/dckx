n this comic is a reference to revolutionary physicist albert einstein who got his first big ideas about physics while he was working as a swiss patent clerk hence randall jokes that there is pressure on other swiss patent clerks to come up with genius ideas while they are working there the title text refers to quantum gravity a highly anticipated theory that would unify quantum mechanics with the current model of gravity general relativity such a theory would be very useful to understanding how space behaves at high energies and high densities such as black holes and the very early universe the joke is that instead of a patent clerk making this theory as everyone is supposedly expecting it's instead made by someone wearing patent leather shoes and working on a movie called clerks ii thereby suggesting that anytime something called a patent crosses with anything called a clerk radical breakthroughs in physics result clerks ii is the second movie in the clerks series by kevin smith widely regarded as not nearly as good as the first xe2x80x94 which could be said about most sequels but you get the point
