n the punchline of this comic is that just by naming bands from the game guitar hero you can sound pretty knowledgeable about music without actually knowing anything about the bands you are naming this is further emphasized when megan mentions metallica a very famous band that mostly everyone can be assumed to have heard of and cueball has no clue who they are presumably because metallica is not featured in guitar hero on the title text cueball or possibly randall is just hoping for a sequel on guitar hero to get more and newer conversational material
