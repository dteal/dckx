n herein the author devises a method of addressing the issue of drivers who turn up their music to irritating levels which usually results in a lot of bass coming from the car xe2x80x94 the low frequencies being the ones that most easily penetrate the car and travel farther thus being more audible to those around the car as the title suggests the idea is to condition animals to respond to a thumping bass the machine is described as working as follows every few hours the bass would turn on and the box would dispense food behind an opening designed to look like an open car window over time local wildlife would flock to the box to get the food from inside and would become trained that the sound of a subwoofer means that they can get food by flying through a car window eventually the animals would respond to any low music including that played by cars the end result would be that the local wildlife would approach and presumably attempt to enter any car that has that same thumping bass drivers in turn would cease to turn up their music in order to prevent the groups of animals from chasing after their cars thus solving the problem of annoyingly loud bass this behavior modification can itself be seen as a somewhat different form of conditioning although this plan may seem far fetched a similar scheme was seriously proposed in britain during the world war i to condition seagulls to associate a submarine's periscope with food which would give away the locations of enemy submarines as the gulls flocked to their periscopes being raised the title text is a dialogue about using a similar method of conditioning to send animals after the pope why someone would want that to happen is left to the reader's imagination
