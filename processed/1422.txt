n beret guy's phone is about to die cueball assumes this just means that the battery is running out and it needs to be recharged but the phone in question appears to die in a way analogous to the life and death of a star expending its fuel while heating up and expanding before ultimately losing its outer layers and becoming a white dwarf or similar lesser star however this is something phones usually don't do&#91;citation needed&#93;  stars constantly undergo fusion reactions the pressure generated by these reactions counteracts gravity preventing it from collapsing the star during its main lifespan as the hydrogen mostly fuses into helium in the core the core gradually becomes more dense and the region of fusion gradually moves away from the center then the star grows in size reaching the stage of a red giant when most of the fuel for fusion has been consumed gravity will collapse the star into a white dwarf while the outer layers are shed for stars much more massive than the sun there will be a supernova explosion caused by a violent collapse which is very powerful and leaves behind a neutron star or a black hole depending on how much mass is left after the supernova stars with more hydrogen fuel tend to burn brighter and faster beret guy's refusal of a charger is probably a reference to this both a supernova explosion and the collapse of red giants into white dwarfs shed their outer layers which is referenced in the title text once extra mass is added to the dying star analogous to charging the process only accelerates the phone seems to have a certain mass because beret guy expects it to go supernova charging the phone may lead to a type 1a nova the comic also plays on the release of two new iphone models with bigger screens planned for 2 days after the release of the comic the comic could be also explained by the characteristics of li ion batteries which are used in most cellphones at the end of their useful life these batteries grow a bit &#91;citation needed&#93; in case of severe physical or thermal damage or multiple electrical failures this type of battery can indeed overheat leading to a thermal runaway reaction inside that would result in the battery growing &#91;citation needed&#93; and eventually exploding connecting a charger to a battery failing in this manner would probably make the process faster 1 the title text implies that after beret guy's iphone goes supernova it will become either a slowly fading palm pilot a calculator or a two way pager this would be the cellphone equivalent of a white dwarf evidenced by the faint and slowly fading glow neutron star or black hole evidence black holes emit information in the form of hawking radiation and have at one time been suspected to be half of a two way portal through spacetime along with a white hole additionally some particles and atoms decay by breaking into smaller more elementary particles it may be humorously implied that a palmpilot an early personal data assistant and precursor to the smartphone a calculator a very simple electronic device and two way pager a device for sending and receiving short text messages are the more elementary components that make up an iphone
