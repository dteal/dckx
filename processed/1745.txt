n a vinyl disc also known as a gramophone record is a type of storage medium that stores music on the disc with a groove  as the disc turns a stylus rides along the groove and translates the pattern of the wiggles of the groove into sound  this sound then causes a magnetic or piezoelectric transducer to transform the sound into a corresponding electric current which is then amplified these are often played on a phonograph also known as record players since 1940s or most recently turntables the noise referred to as a record scratch can be caused by someone attempting to stop the record's play by dragging the stylus across the radius of the record or by stopping the disc's rotation with one's hand opposing the turntable's rotation as a result this is often used as a sound effect in movies for comedic effect this type of sound is also often used in hip hop music; in particular rapidly and manually rotating the disc in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions the comic pokes fun at a movie clichxc3xa9 in which the story opens with the main character in some kind of unbelievable predicament followed by a record scratch seemingly freezing time as the character narrates yup that's me you're probably wondering how i ended up in this situation the rest of the story then follows often by going back in time to depict the events that leads up to the situation of the opening scene so in this case it would be interesting to know why cueball is at a party where everyone has wine glasses in their hands but suddenly one of the glasses cueball's or his nearest adversary's is lying on the floor and why it seems like a fight is about to break out this is what the movies would normally begin to explain typically in a flashback after the scratch at the time of the comic's posting parodying the clichxc3xa9 variations on the phrase had become a popular meme on social media as the record scratch continues to be used despite the fact that record players gramophones have largely become obsolete technology randall pokes fun at this by beginning this meme by giving the backstory on what that sound actually is as many people from the younger generation may very well not know this rather than giving context to the situation via a story this is yet one more of randall's comics that is trying to make people feel old and is likely most relevant to those who have actually used vinyl to listen to music comedy or other recordings the title text indicates in a manner similar to that of 891 movie ages that the 78 rpm era xe2x80x93 referring to the fact that the original industry standard of records making 78 revolutions per minute rpm 1925 1950s xe2x80x93 is now closer to the time of the american civil war 1861 1865 than it is to present day another way that randall is making the reader feel old note; these 78 rpm records were made of shellac not of vinyl
