n this comic is a joke about the difficulty of testing a drug that is supposed to block the placebo effect a placebo experiment is used for testing a drug candidate it has two groups one that gets a real drug candidate and one that gets a fake the placebo effect describes the observation that the group that gets the fake often show signs of having received a working drug though commonly weaker than in the group that gets an effective real drug in this comic cueball is trying to test a placebo blocker this means that the one that gets the real thing will think that they got it because they did and the group that gets the fake will think that they got the real thing because of the placebo effect and this makes hairbun's head hurt cueball states to hairbun with a citation from the real world that his team created a placebo blocker a drug designed to prevent the placebo effect cueball begins to design a test for this new drug following typical experimental design patients would be split into two groups a control group and the group that receives the treatment cueball knows that the treatment given to the control group is supposed to be designed so that it is not influenced by the variable trying to be isolated as the placebo effect is the effect under investigation a placebo can not be used as a control treatment as a comparison with a placebo blocker cueball tries to design around this in his test both groups would receive a placebo as a treatment for an unspecified condition the treatment placebo; in addition the test group would receive the placebo blocker drug while the control group would get a placebo pill instead the placebo blocker placebo if this works as expected the treatment placebo would be blocked by the placebo blocker in the test group while in the control group the placebo blocker placebo may have a placebo effect in blocking the placebo effect of the treatment placebo and the difference between these effects can be measured to test the effectiveness of the placebo blocker cueball and hairbun think about this trial until they both develop headache from frustration cueball then kindly offers hairbun a sugar pill while this might have helped cure the headache via the placebo effect had he told her it was a headache treatment by revealing the pill as merely a sugar pill it may suppress or reduce the effect although as noted above it would probably still have some effect in the title text cueball mentions that his sugar pills against headache works even better together with the new experimental placebo boosters incidentally he indicates that he keeps those in the same bottle with his sugar pills assuming someone believes placebo boosters are in the jar this would allow them to take the sugar pills and receive a greater placebo effect as the placebo effect is based upon faith in the treatment regardless of whether there are placebo boosters in the jar it is possible but unlikely that   cueball's sugar pills are in fact the placebo blockers themselves and that seeing hairbun has a headache cueball is inspired to somehow use the opportunity as an experiment to test the blockers  cueball is suggesting hairbun take a placebo booster which is really a placebo blocker thus testing the blocker he mentioned earlier in the comic  questionable neuroscience research is also discussed in 1453 fmri
