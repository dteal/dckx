n cueball is attempting to make hash browns a hash brown is a way of serving a potato where the potato has been diced or shredded in some way then pan fried cueball's method for making hash browns though is rather unique he is throwing potatoes into the air and striking them with a flaming tennis racket at his friend who is holding a tray with a dangerously tilting half filled glass balanced on top he the friendis also holding a fork in the other hand  the idea is that the tennis racket would simultaneously dice the potato fry it and then launch the completed product towards his friend's plate in reality this probably wouldn't do much to properly pan fry food it must be cooked in a pan with some oil to lubricate the food with enough time for the heat to transfer through the oil and spread properly through the food hitting a potato with a flaming tennis racket would not cook it as it would strike it too quickly and it probably wouldn't dice it either unless the wire of the racket is incredibly sharp cueball would probably just end up batting a not even hot uncooked unprepared potato at his friend while simultaneously burning his own hand the title text comments on how many ways this experiment could go badly 14 and jokes that there are even more potential problems 17 if the fork cueball's friend is holding is a cross breed see 419 forks and spoons which was published only four days earlier by reading this comic it should be clear what could go wrong if they were included in the equation 3 more ways would be a low estimate it's unclear what randall may or may not have had on his mind with regards to specific ways the situation in the comic could go wrong but here are 14 potential ways the activity could go wrong without including sporks  cueball could burn himself with the flaming tennis racket the can of gasoline could leak and then cueball could drop the racket causing a fire to spread cueball may fail to hit the potato and it would get dirty from the ground cueball may fail to hit the potato and whack himself with the aforementioned flaming tennis racket cueball may hit the potato and knock the plate out of his friend's hand smashing it cueball may hit the potato and knock the glass out of his friend's hand smashing that instead both of the above could happen cueball might instead hit the potato at his friend's head cueball could accidentally launch the tennis racket itself if he has exceptionally poor grip at his friend cueball could drop the tennis racket onto the can of gasoline causing it to explode even if none of the above happened cueball would fail to actually cook the potato likewise cueball would probably not succeed in dicing the potato and he could miss hitting his friends plate a velociraptor could appear out of nowhere and eat the potato then proceed to devour cueball and his friend a possibility which likely plagues randall's mind daily
