n this comic represents the impacts due to climate change by demonstrating the changes in climate that should be expected with a given change in global temperature this is done by detailing the world's climate in geologic periods where the global average temperature has changed by one or more ice age units or iau the comic defines an iau as the difference in global temperature between today and the last ice age about 45&#160;xc2xb0c an iau of 0 represents modern global temperature  it was later followed with a similar but much more elaborate chart in 1732 earth temperature timeline one iau unit happens to be the expected increase in global temperature the world will see by the end of year 2100 the prediction of 4 5 degrees celsius of warming may not appear significant but is easy to see as a substantial difference when comparing today to the last ice age    an iau of4 is associated with snowball earth snowball earth is a near total freezing of the entire surface around 650 million years ago in the cryogenian this may have been the greatest ice age known to have occurred on earth   an iau of1 is associated with the last ice age during this time randall's neighborhood was buried under an ice sheet   an iau of +1 is the predicted global temperature by the end of year 2100 while it makes sense to assume it's just as drastic a difference as1 iau we still don't know the actual nature of what it would be which is why it is represented by a question mark in the comic   an iau of +2 is associated with the hothouse earth of the early cretaceous period at this time there were palm trees at the poles as there were polar forests during cretaceous summers average temperature of north pole during the summer is 0&#160;xc2xb0c or 32&#160;xc2xb0f 0+2*45 = 9&#160;xc2xb0c = 482&#160;xc2xb0f hot enough for trees to grow at the north pole under hypothetical 2 iau scenarios  an increase of 45&#160;xc2xb0c +1 iau seems like a small change in temperature but the changes it would cause are likely very large as it can also be described as halfway to palm trees at the poles the topic of ice coverage over various cities has previously been covered in 1225 ice sheets the image of boston from that comic is reused at the top of the huge chart in 1732 earth temperature timeline this comic shows the extreme extend to which global warming can and will change our environment randall presented this view earlier in 164 playing devil's advocate to win climate change especially global warming is a recurring theme in xkcd and randall is clearly convinced that we are causing it the title text expands demonstrating that  the potential impacts of an increase by the ipcc report's best case scenario of 2&#160;xc2xb0c about half an ice age unit makes controlling climate change seem more urgent the figure of 2&#160;xc2xb0c is the most commonly agreed temperature target that assumes the creation of aggressive emissions limits at the time of the publishing of the comic
