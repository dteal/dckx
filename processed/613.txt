n the n body problem in physics refers to our inability to analytically solve sets of differential equations modelling gravitational attraction between more than two bodies simply put there are exact equations for describing the movement of two bodies reacting to each other's gravitational pull but no such solutions exist for systems of three or more bodies the punchline of the comic is a play on the word bodies a threesome involves three human bodies and it is implied that the physicist's participation in the threesome was hindered due to their inability to solve for the movement of said bodies according to the title text megan proposed that they settle for a numerical solution since a closed form solution is unavailable a numerical solution to predict the motion of a system would be an open procedural solution or simulation on the one hand such a solution can be more practical and less time consuming than a closed form solution especially in cases such as the three body problem where the latter is suspected to be impossible on the other hand a numerical solution is only an approximation and will tend to deviate from the exact solution over time in the context of the comic megan probably was suggesting that a numerical solution would be sufficiently accurate for the duration of the threesome but it appears that the physicist insisted that they arrive at an exact solution a frequent observation in random n body encounters is that one or more bodies are ejected from the system by achieving escape velocity and loneliness but stable solutions are possible a closed form solution would allow one to predict for how long such an arrangement would remain stable ironically it could be that the physicist's insistence on finding an exact solution resulted in them being excluded/ejected from the threesome which arguably would be very awkward
