n in the comic megan confuses a popular method of identification of the dangerous north american coral snake by its red yellow and black stripes with the color coding system used to indicate the resistance of electrical resistors the coral snake has red bands adjacent to its yellow bands however coral snakes are mimicked by nonvenomous species with similar coloring such as the milk snake whose red bands are not adjacent to its yellow bands this has led to a variety of rhyming mnemonics such as xe2x80x9cred touches yellow kill a fellow; red touches black friend of jackxe2x80x9d  because megan is describing a red band being adjacent to a yellow band she is indeed holding a coral snake which contains the most potent venom of any snake in north america this assumes of course that the comic takes place in north america the familiar mnemonic does not apply to south and central american coral snakes instead of realizing the danger megan equates the color bands to having the same function as those printed on electrical resistors resistors have at least three bands to identify their resistance value in ohms followed by an optional fourth band showing the tolerance as within the bounds of a certain percentage of the aforementioned resistance value a red band followed by a yellow and a black one identifies a 24 ohm resistor the omega symbol xe2x80x9cxcexa9xe2x80x9d stands for ohms as per the mnemonic north american coral snakes have an additional yellow band between the black band and the next red band yellow corresponds to a tolerance of &#177;5% so the actual resistance will be between 228xcexa9 and 252xcexa9 see this resistor code calculator resistor color codes were also mentioned in 227 color codes the title text refers to the fourth band specifying the tolerance but interprets it as the snake's tolerance for being held before biting instead of the measure of the imprecision of the 24 ohms in the case of yellow this would refer to a tolerance value of 5% how tolerance to being held is measured left ambiguous if the value represents the probability of being bitten over a given period of time then larger numbers would mean a less tolerant snake  if it instead represents the position on some per determined tolerance scale between 0 and 1 then larger values would represent a 'more' tolerant snake
