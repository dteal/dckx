n the comic begins with a grainy pencil drawing of megan on a ship this is a clue that things are not as they appear as the point of view pulls back in each successive frame we see that megan on a ship is really a thought bubble belonging to cueball who is sitting at his desk he apparently is day dreaming instead of working note that this is presented in the standard crisp format as if drawn on a computer this suggests it shows us our normal view however as the perspective continues to pull back we see that cueball thinking of megan is actually a thought bubble belonging to megan in the final frames the ship sails out of frame however since the final frames are in the same grainy pencil drawing format it suggests that this is still cueball's thoughts rather than an actual image of megan the title text or so i hope shows us what this recursion really means cueball hopes that megan realizes that he misses her but suggests he's not entirely certain she does
