n cueball as a news anchor is reporting a message from a politician shown behind him the comic is mocking the old media television radio newspapers for their move to opinions as an information source such change came with development of the internet and new media as source of information websites blogs social networks which pushed old media back and diminished their significance in their attempt to return to relevance old media tried to copy the opinion part of the news taking what could be considered a bad thing from them the humor of the comic comes from news anchor cutting to an opinion piece from people on the street thus proving the politician's point the title text illustrates what randall sees as the problem with this approach  the new media for the large part consists of uninformed opinions from people of average intelligence and abilities  however the sheer volume and immediacy of information is threatening to destroy old media much as the iceberg destroyed the titanic  you don't join with the iceberg or try to emulate its methods; the iceberg does not care it's too big and will destroy you anyway the way to survive is to steer away and find your own path  old media must present us with something better than new media for example informed analytical intelligent otherwise we have no need of them
