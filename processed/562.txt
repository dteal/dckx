n there are few things so annoying as finding when a parking lot is full that someone has parked so carelessly as to take up two spaces  even worse it may have been intentional; they decided to exchange the risk of someone accidentally scratching their car for the risk of someone doing it on purpose see  1030 keyed however there are also non violent ways to tackle the problem; politely leave a note or if possible just move their car whether to its proper alignment or to an impound lot of course black hat takes the less traveled path apparently involving a cutting torch and what looks to be a circular saw the offending portion of the parked car is sliced off entirely without surgical precision and neatly slotted into the remainder of the space it is now legally parked but will never become a functional car again&#91;citation needed&#93; but at least black hat finally has space for his own car admittedly he's done this kind of thing before see 496 secretary part 3 the title text indicates that a large crowd watched black hat at work but refused to identify him presumably because they feel that the car owner got what he deserved and possibly because they didn't want to incur black hat's wrath
