n cueball is taking a scientific approach to creating a valentine card based on the first chart the recipient is his fiancxc3xa9e since he noted major events first meeting and engaged thus they are not married yet or it should have been noted on the graph the labels of a heart and smiley represent cueball's feelings for her and happiness accordingly this implies that cueball had love and feelings for someone else before he first met the love he is breaking up with while they were dating the feelings and happiness levels were very unstable as is expected for any new relationship that later dropped to current levels probably due to cueball's lack of love towards her in the second panel there are variables r0r1r2 each value at 020061083 accordingly this is probably his love at different chronological points in his relationship r0 being the start this contradicts the data in the first panel's chart as is contains no negative values assuming a cartesian plane the text in the space between 2nd and 3rd panels show that randall munroe is against scientific misconduct it also shows that cueball's rigorous approach makes him realize that the happiness he derives from the relationship is declining which presents him with a choice will he be a true scientist by accepting data that he doesn't like or will he be romantic and just make a cute card  the last panel is a parody of a brokentorn heart a common symbol used to represent people falling out of love the line could be interpreted as a graph of the amount of love between the two or a literal tearing of the heart in two he decides that he is a scientist and so presents his significant other with a breakup valentine even though he originally intended it as a confirmation of their love the comic may be intended as a cautionary tale to new scientists; while the graph in the leftmost panel shows an apparent correlation between cueball's love and his happiness and it shows his happiness is lower than it might be expected to be without his partner it fails to show that the falling love effects falling happiness   it may be the case that falling happiness effects falling love or that both happiness and love are affected by an unidentified factor  for example temporary external crises may be weighing on cueball's relationship as well as his happiness the title text seems to be him trying to console himself that he did the right thing you should not use science to prove that your theory is right but to find out which theory is the right one
