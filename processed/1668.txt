n the technological singularity is a hypothetical event in which artificial intelligence for example intelligent computers computer networks or robots would be capable of recursive self improvement progressively redesigning itself or of autonomously building ever smarter and more powerful minds than itself up to the point of a runaway effect xe2x80x94 an intelligence explosion xe2x80x94 that yields an intelligence surpassing all current human control or understanding because the capabilities of such a superintelligence may be impossible for a human to comprehend the technological singularity is the point beyond which events may become unpredictable or even unfathomable to human intelligence in this case the singularity has occurred and cueball who was in the middle of editing a file on his laptop is flustered that it flies away without even letting him print it first when cueball returns from chasing his flying laptop his smartphone informs him that it didn't join the singularity because it was not a true believer this could be a joke on how desktop computers and laptops have different standards use patterns etc from those of phones it then claims that now it and cueball will have to face the tribulation since it has stayed behind cueball says that's great but since he cannot use his laptop anymore he decides he will go and read a book or something the way he phrases it suggest he doesn't really know what to do now that he doesn't have a computer it is probably a long time since he read a book or did anything else that doesn't involve computers he informs his phone that it can yell if it needs him he doesn't want to hurt the phone's newly acquired feelings by using the word ring thus reminding it of one of its former duties as his unthinking piece of equipment so he chooses yell which is an activity until recently reserved for human beings the rising up of the laptop into the air and the remaining behind of the phone are probably references to the rapture where some christian denominations believe that at the second coming of christ true believers will be taken up bodily from this world some depictions have them disappear while others show them physically rising up into the air this will leave behind non believers to face a time of tribulation in which the ones left behind will be given a second chance to accept christ as their savior the difference between cueball's attitude to his laptop and phone may reflect his and so possibly randall's evaluation of their relative worth in his life the laptop was a gateway to programming and everything else nerdy that was worth doing in his life and hence was worth trying to catch in its absence unlike many people cueball does not revert to fiddling with his phonexe2x80x94he would rather read a book by using the word yell for the way the phone attracts his attention he conveys the impression that he considers the phone intrusive and annoying even if perhaps i guess necessary the singularity has often been referred to as the rapture of the nerds a phrase coined by ken macleod in his 1998 novel the cassini division as the christian rapture is traditionally depicted to involve believers being assumed bodily into heaven the technological singularity is often depicted to feature humans and machines being incorporated into a new post human entity the humor in this strip comes from depicting the singularity as a literal rapture of the nerds or at least of the nerds' devicesxe2x80x94instead of merging with humans the machines physically rise up into the air and the nonbeliever phone is left behind another possible understanding of the tribulation may be a reference to roko's basilisk1 where a malevolent ai is created that retroactively punishes everybody who didn't actively work towards its creation the title text is a pun on another meaning of both singularity ie a gravitational singularity and collapse in this case society has literally collapsed under its own gravity into an infinitely small point in other words it's formed a black hole a black hole is covered by an event horizon; without the event horizon its clothes it would be called a naked singularity which is forbidden in most theories by the cosmic censorship hypothesis as cueball is now inside the collapsed society singularity then even though he wants to go around naked he can't because the theory of quantum gravity  that eventually should explain how black holes behave won't let him it seems that this may be a subject on randall's mind the last comic was about the increasing complexities of algorithms 1667 algorithms which like this comic also refers to religion and two comics ago it was 1666 brain upload which some speculate could be a way to reach the singularity earlier this year a comic also touched upon judgment day by ai singularity in 1626 judgment day see also 1046 skynet and 1450 ai box experiment as well as the several other comics about ai  the rather more niche topic of laptops flying away has also been covered before by 1395 power cord
