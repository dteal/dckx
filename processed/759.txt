n in college courses with a very large number of students picture the huge tiered amphitheater style lecture halls shown in any movie or tv show about college teaching assistants are employed to help the professors grade student work in math and science courses students are expected to solve the problems and show their work as supporting evidence due to the high volume of work to grade whether it's being done by the professor or a ta the grader will get lazy and look for correct answers and the existence of work without checking that the work is accurate the math switches from xe2x88x9a being square root notation to it being division notation midway that is an illegal operation but the correct answer is reached anyway because 27 is the correct answer to 3 &#215; 9 3xe2x88x9a81 and 81 &#247; 3 more generally this pattern holds true for any number and its square; namely xf0x9dx91xa5xf0x9dx91xa6 = xf0x9dx91xa6&#178; &#247; xf0x9dx91xa5 whenever xf0x9dx91xa6 = x&#178; &#160;  namely x*y = y^2/x whenever y=x^2
