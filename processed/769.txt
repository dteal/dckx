n today's comic seems to be a parable about the perils of love during wartime our protagonist beret guy is seen here leaning against his pack behind a low wall surely a good hiding spot for any gentleman with a rifle and scope judging by the letter he's in the midst of writing he has a complex relationship with cordelia on the one hand she's attractive on the other hand she's a sniper as evidenced by the shots fired mid missive cordelia's fire works against her though as her volley of shots has revealed her own position atop the maintenance shed we can presume that in a matter of minutes this love affair will go sour as the love letter is wrapped around a live grenade and delivered so to speak war is indeed hell  it is possibly that they're playing a game such as paintball though in which case the green beret would mask friendly fire of the same color as to the title text the green berets are worn only by special forces soldiers it takes a lot of training to become a green beret and as evidenced by our protagonist's clever use of decoys to outwit a sniper he may be qualified for the honor it sounds however as if he didn't understand the proposition preferring his regular beret instead further evidence for his idiocy is given immediately thereafter as he confesses that he wears a beret under his helmet then again he does not have a choice since he has stapled the beret on his head the comic starts off with the commonly known stereotype of a soldier in war writing a letter to his sweetheart cordelia presumably at home after the gunshots interrupt his writing we come to know that cordelia is actually fighting on the opposite side it is left open whether they are in an actual relationship or the soldier just writes love letters to his enemies he explains to her that he can now locate her after she shot a decoy set up by him closing with the phrase war is hell often used in the stereotypical situation described above and now having a much darker tint the title text gives the reader some kind of closure the soldier is revealed to be beret guy from whom this kind of behavior doesn't seem so weird after all cordelia is likely a reference to cordelia rosalindxe2x80x94the sniper from the miniature game anima tactics
