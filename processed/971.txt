n while the comic is funny on its own in a wake up sheeple kind of way the title text reveals that the comic is a parable about homeopathy the comic title is a play on alternative medicine in the comic it is implied that cueball has been scammed into buying blank books though he attempts to defend it as a valid choice the title text likens this to the cvs pharmacy selling homeopathic pills using methods that does not clearly distinguish them from traditional pharmaceuticals homeopathy is a pseudoscience based on the idea that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people will cure that disease in sick people if administered in sufficiently small doses  it is possible that cueball actually bought blank notebooks and is scamming himself into believing he made a valid and logical choice homeopathic remedies are prepared by repeatedly diluting a substance with alcohol or water somewhat counter intuitively homeopathy considers the weakest dilutions to have the most powerful healing effect frequently in fact the dilutions are repeated past the point where any meaningful number of molecules of the active ingredient can remain selling a homeopathic remedy as actual medicine when it is just water is analogous to selling blank books the smudge of ink cueball mentions in the comic may be referencing the fact that some of the less diluted homeopathic remedies can contain a tiny amount of the original substance
