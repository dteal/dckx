n this comic is a yet another graph describing how people who don't own a television feel throughout several time periods while televisions have existed since 1928 regular scheduled broadcasts of television programs did not begin until the late 1940s so before the 1950s it was common not to own a television and therefore most people's feelings about it would be fairly neutral this changed as televisions became cheaper and more people started owning them meaning that if someone didn't own a television it was generally because they couldn't afford one this might lead to someone feeling embarrassment when admitting they don't have a television gradually television ownership increased until eventually nearly every household had at least one television and those that did not were more and more likely to do so by choice rather than due to poverty the graph therefore peaks at around the year 2000 when many people would be proud to say that they did not own a television randall suggests that these people would feel smug because they are resisting a popular trend owning a television which the rest of the public take part in the graph tails downwards at the end suggesting that randall believes that people are becoming less smug this could be because of the abundance of video content and other forms of entertainment on the internet and mobile devices so according to randall people are returning to not owning a television simply because it's not necessary and these people therefore feel neutral towards their lack of a television another point of view is that with the advent of the internet for news and weather along with video on demand services such as netflix televisions have become obsolete for some households and thus not owning one can be seen as moving with the times or those that don't own one see those that still have one as old fashioned hence the smug however in recent times television has become imbued with new technologies such as internet access known as smart tvs and thus owning a television is seen as trendy again thus the level of smugness drops the initial upturn from embarrassment to smugness may also be a commentary on the quality of television programs over that period in the 1950s and 1960s television was a major source of news and information those without televisions might feel that they were missing out of the important stories of the day also the limited number of stations and lack of recording devices meant that discussions of the previous night's television programming was far more inclusive with more people watching the same programs at the same time until the advent of pvrs the prior night's television programming was a popular water cooler topic ie something discussed socially at the office the next day this means that that those who had missed out on those programs might feel socially out of the loop by contrast since 2000 many programs were criticized as poor quality or mindless eg daytime talk shows and reality shows so someone might feel more smug for not watching so called mindless television similarly as television viewership increased from the 1950s through the 2000s it is possible that other activities such as reading has decreased; especially given that the younger generation today don't remember a time without television so someone who did not own a television set might feel more smug because they take part in more beneficial activities like reading exercise and studying the title text suggests that whether people feel embarrassed or smug doesn't depend directly on what percentage of the population owns tvs tv ownership rate or even on how quickly this percentage is growing derivative of tv ownership rate with respect to time; instead it depends on how the change in this percentage is speeding up or slowing down second derivative of tv ownership rate with respect to time specifically as the rate at which people adopt tv ownership accelerates positive second derivative of tv ownership rate with respect to time people who don't own one feel embarrassed negative smugness; and as the market is saturated and the rate at which people adopt tv ownership slows down negative second derivative of tv ownership rate with respect to time people who don't own one feel smug positive smugness if people feel twice as embarrassed/smug when this rate of acceleration/deceleration doubles then we have randall's formulation smugness is proportional to the negative second derivative of tv ownership rate with respect to time as evidence for this the adoption of tv ownership should theoretically follow a sigmoid curve which is the graph of something that starts small grows in a spurt and then approaches a maximum capacity in this case 100% the negative second derivative of a sigmoid curve looks very much like randall's graph
