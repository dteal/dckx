n the comic shows scientists testing a new technology to blend species  they show that their new technology allows them to cross a spork an even mix between a spoon and a fork with a spoon to make a new implement that is three quarters spoon  and one quarter fork by blending these new fork spork hybrids and their results together the scientists could create any mix between a spoon and a fork obviously regular genetics cannot apply to non living items such as metal cutlery in the second panel the amounts of spoon and fork are shown with fractions the number on the left representing the amount of fork and the right the amount of spoon the numbers for the cross product below is arrived at by summing each side and dividing by two 0+1/2/2 = 1/4 and 1+1/2/2 = 3/4 the breeding scheme between the second and the third panel shows at the top how to create a spork from a spoon and a fork then how this spork could both be bred with either a spoon as in panel two or a fork as shown in the lower right part the binary fork spoon spectrum in between the third and fourth panels shows the complete spectrum of sporks from fork to spoon with some of the intermediate steps labeled the numbers representing how much fork each contains since it is a binary spectrum only fractions with a denominator that is a power of 2 will be possible ie 2^n with n any integer so in the middle is a spork with 1/2 fork in between the spork and the spoon there is only 1/4 fork and in between that and the spoon only 1/8 fork and so on also 3/4 fork is marked whereas 3/8 5/8 and 7/8 fork is only indicated on the ruler by a small marks for instance they could breed a 3/8 fork spork by mixing a 1/4 fork spork with a spork the comic begins like standard sci fi fare where amoral scientists request funding from mysterious benefactors the dialogue of you're toying with powerful forces here and we know what we're doing is a classic trope foreshadowing that things will soon go horribly wrong it inevitably leads to the humorous incongruity of a sentient spork on a murderous rampage rachael ray and emeril mentioned in the title text are celebrity chefs and steven spielberg is a famous movie director the joke seems to be that if the laboratory hadn't hired the two renowned chefs spielberg wouldn't have heard about the project and would not have made a movie about it in which the two scientists are killed off horribly it is probably the scientist from the first panel megan and her friend cueball or the actors hired to portray them in the film the plot in the comic is very similar to the story in spielberg's jurassic park
