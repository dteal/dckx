n voyager 1 is a us space probe launched in 1977 to study the outer reaches of the solar system and beyond popular press has on several occasions announced that it has left the solar system at each point when a boundary has been confirmed or a major event has taken place this underscores the fact that there is no strictly defined and recognizable boundary of the solar system or at least we haven't found one yet   on the day of this comics release 2013 03 22 it was announced that voyager 1 had entered a new region of space at this point voyager 1 had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium although this latter was first confirmed about half a year later in september 2013 the chart shows that voyager 1 has left the solar system 22 times but in the title text only 16 are mentioned the title text lists several such possible boundaries and how many times voyager 1 has passed them together with fictive humorous ones real boundaries  three times the termination shock xe2x80x93 the point in the heliosphere where the solar wind slows down to subsonic speed relative to the star because of interactions with the local interstellar medium when exactly voyager 1 passed the termination shock is not clear and on wikipedia there is given dates of 2003 2004 and 2005 the final estimate was that it happened late in 2004 thus fitting with three times  twice the heliopause xe2x80x93 the theoretical boundary where the sun's solar wind is stopped by the interstellar medium it was first reported in 2012 that voyager 1 had reached the heliopause but first on the day of this comics release was it officially announced that it had passed through to the interstellar medium thus fitting with two times  once only each the heliosphere xe2x80x93 a region of space dominated by earth's sun a sort of bubble of charged particles in the space surrounding the solar system we live inside this region at its boundary there are three named borders which are the real ones mentioned before and after this in the title text from inside to out they are the termination shock the heliosheath and the heliopause the reason the other two are mentioned first is that they have occurred more than once and the list begins with those for that reason as these other three borders are also part of the heliosphere with the heliopause being the outer border of the heliosphere then voyager 1 will have left the heliosphere at the same time as it left the heliopause  the heliosheath xe2x80x93 the region of the heliosphere beyond the termination shock it was confirmed that voyager 1 passed through this at the end of 2010 so this occurred two yreas before the heliopause was reached but since it only happened once it is mentioned after the first two and maybe after the heliosphere because it is inside this region    fictional boundaries  heliodrome xe2x80x93 yet another composition of helios sun here together with dromos course there is no astronomical object with this name but it has been used variously in other contexts one that became famous is a sports hall which was used as a concentration camp in the bosnian war see heliodrom camp auroral discontinuity another fictitious astronomic object for auroral see aurora astronomy heaviside layer xe2x80x93 a layer of ionized gas occurring between roughly 90xe2x80x93150&#160;km 56xe2x80x9393&#160;mi above the ground in the earth's atmosphere popularly recognized for its use as a reference to heaven in the writings of t s eliot adapted into andrew lloyd webber's musical cats trans neptunian panic zone xe2x80x93 this fictional zone combines the word from two subjects transxe2x80x93neptunian is used in astronomy to describe stuff that occurs beyond the planet neptune in outdoor education the panic zone is the opposite of the comfort zone when trying to learn new stuff magnetogap xe2x80x93 part of an ignition system us census bureau solar system statistical boundary xe2x80x93 a fictive boundary supposedly defined by the united states census bureau similarly to how it defines census areas for the purpose of processing statistical data about regions in the united states in this case the bureau's boundary for determining the population of the solar system kuiper gauntlet xe2x80x93 this is a play on the kuiper belt which is a region of the solar system beyond the planets extending from the orbit of neptune at 30 au to approximately 50 au from the sun notable for being full of asteroids; replacing the word belt with gauntlet glove often spelled 'gantlet' which is a protective glove as well as gauntlet punishment which is a medieval punishment where one would be forced to run through two lines of men who would hit the punishee oort void xe2x80x93 refers to the oort cloud a gigantic cloud of materials mainly composed of ice which ends around a light year from the sun and is deemed the current edge of the solar system the void may be pun on density of that cloud the number of bodies in it may be huge but given its size it's mostly empty crystal sphere holding the fixed stars xe2x80x93 this refers to historical ideas about the universe particularly the ptolemaic system in which the stars were supposed to be fixed on a large crystal sphere around the earth it might also be referencing the crystal spheres a short story by david brin in which humanity's first interstellar ship shatters a previously undetected protective barrier around the solar system  it may also be a reference to the dungeons and dragons setting spelljammer total count above reaches 16 exits from the solar system vs 22 in the comic itself  see also voyager over the xe2x80x9cheliocliffxe2x80x9d but solar system transition mysterious article on ars technica
