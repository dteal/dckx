n this comic is a joke about the psychological theory that animals conditioned using seemingly random rewards and punishments promotes superstitious behavior and then extrapolates this theory to humans and wi fi signal integrity often when connecting to unfamiliar wi fi networks the signal displayed by the connecting device varies wildly especially as distance increases poor wireless signal and drops in connection can be extremely frustrating and hence cueball has likely tried a variety of methods to improve the signal as a result of his desperation he replicates scenarios that are unlikely methods to increase his signal but in some way mirror conditions where he has been successful finding a signal in the past his past conditions have somehow led him to having the superstition that holding a pineapple while standing on top of a chair may resolve the problem likely the signal increased at random while he was standing on a chair holding the pineapple and he erroneously concluded that the chair and pineapple caused the signal strength increase it is almost inconceivable that this technique could have any positive effect on the signal&#91;citation needed&#93; this is related to the idea in comic 552 correlation megan questions his ridiculous behavior but it seems cueball has become extremely erratic due to the inconsistent signal strength the title text refers to a fictive study that apparently examined the behavior of rats in response to signal strength on a cellphone it is a reference to b f skinner's experiments in these experiments rats and more frequently cited pigeons are taught superstitious behavior by being rewarded at random intervals in this new experiment the rats naturally could not understand the concept of signal strength so they chewed up the cellphone leading to the research supervisors questioning the validity of the study and questioning whether the grant money for the study was well used
