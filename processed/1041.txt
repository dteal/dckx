n this comic is based on the famous command don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes given by william prescott an american officer during the american revolutionary war his men were running low on bullets so prescott commanded that they hold their fire until the enemy was close enough to guarantee a hit this was a tactic used by a number of armies such as napoleon's french at aspern and wellington's british in the iberian peninsula in this comic prescott carries on after his initial command adding romantic allegories nearly getting himself shot due to distracting himself also each of his allegories reference a different sense out of the five senses missing only hearing which arguably is also satisfied when they actually hear the shots the title text expands on that stating not to fire until you see the person's soul in their eyes
