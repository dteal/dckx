n in some schools in the united states a student's grades are determined mainly using letters for quick reference&#91;citation needed&#93; in this case  a xe2x80x94 100%xe2x80x9390% b xe2x80x94 89%xe2x80x9380% c xe2x80x94 79%xe2x80x9370% d xe2x80x94 69%xe2x80x9360% f xe2x80x94 59%xe2x80x930%   traditionally these schools send 'report cards' in which the student's current grading of the semester or even the entirety of the class the student is taking is denoted using these letters for example  english xe2x80x94 a mathematics xe2x80x94 a science xe2x80x94 a social studies xe2x80x94 a world building xe2x80x94 a   the student may have noted that if he aims for certain scoring for example altering the quality of his homework or even sending out his homework only at the times needed for his grades to reach a certain level he could make the report card spell every letter grade in alphabetical order deriving from the previous example the student would aim for the following report card  english xe2x80x94 a mathematics xe2x80x94 b science xe2x80x94 c social studies xe2x80x94 d world building xe2x80x94 f   interestingly since even a 0% grade would mark the required 'f' grade the student does not need to work at all not even send out a school assignment to get the required 'f' grade this leading to the situation presented in the comic above the title text references that not only can the grades in the report card inadvertently spell out certain words for example 'cab' or 'fad' but also that the letter grade system denoted omits the letter 'e' in standard letter grading the reason for the missing e is complex and explained at this slate article
