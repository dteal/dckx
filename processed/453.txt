n this comic gives ludicrous and ironic upcoming hurricane paths on an unlabelled map of the americas that shows the region roughly between central canada and northern brazil blue and red dotted lines indicate the future hurricane paths      hurricane name   details    hurricane where the hell is bermuda   enters from the east side of the map wanders around the atlantic ocean in a scribble that seems to take the shape of an ampersand this may be a reference to dwarf fortress in dwarf fortress all objects are represented by ascii art and ampersands represent demons then it goes north for a while and then peters out without entering the bermuda triangle the bermuda triangle is a location in the atlantic ocean loosely framed by the three corners bermuda miami and puerto rico the myth is that too many ships and planes get lost once they enter inside the area of this triangle and disappear without a trace in this case the hurricane gets lost before entering and can't even find the triangle    hurricane illinois has it too easy   comes from somewhere to the north west goes through illinois and then back to the north west this hurricane while actually impossible comes from canada to strike chicago illinois before heading back to canada as hurricanes never hits illinois this particular hurricane thinks they have too easy a time in this particular state interestingly enough though it did not affect the chicago area or correspond with the path displayed in the comic roughly one year later a super derecho a storm resembling a hurricane or tropical storm in movement and form struck central and south illinois in addition to much of missouri and kansas    hurricane freud   refers to sigmund freud who believed that accidental sexual expression was a reflection of the unconscious mind's sexual desires the hurricane's path forms a pair of testicles beside florida florida due to its shape and location can be said to resemble a penis and the hurricane's shape and position exemplify freud's ideas    hurricane screw it let's just trash florida again   comes from the east starts to curve to the north and then turns sharply to head straight for florida and zigzag through it four times before dying out sticking out from the rest of the us florida is prone to hurricanes from the east south and west and with the state not being very high or wide it is common for a hurricane to run over florida lose some strength then rebuild strength over the hot waters in the gulf of mexico only to do a u turn and strike again this is not exactly what happens with this particular hurricane where it turns out into the atlantic ocean again each time just proving that its only wish was to strike florida    hurricane red and hurricane blue   blue is the only hurricane path drawn in blue the two hurricanes are playing a game zipping in straight lines and right angles around haiti jamaica and cuba when red successfully cuts off blue the latter instantly dies and then red dies shortly thereafter the game they play is the game of light cycles from the video game based on the movie tron hurricane blue lost because it crashed into the wall of light left by hurricane red's light cycle    hurricane cosx   forms a curve in the shape of a sinusoid above the bottom edge of the map its path resembles a sine wave this kind of trigonometric functions can however both be expressed as sinx or cosx the latter being a cosine wave they look exactly the same when there is no clearly defined coordinate system as in this case  the title text refers to the 1938 new england hurricane also known as the long island express that caused $47 billion in damage had it been further west it could have caused more damage as the right side of a hurricane is stronger and more destructive than the left side as the winds on the right side push water inland randall asks for more damage assessments for such a hurricane that would be able to flood manhattan in new york only four years after this cartoon was published making it almost prophetic hurricane sandy did strike the new yorkxe2x80x93new jersey area as a post tropical cyclone storm hurricane sandy caused an estimated $74 billion in damage  the 1938 hurricane is also referenced in 980 money where it is calculated that it would have caused $78 billion had it happened in 2011 however if that hurricane had taken the same turn as sandy did the cost today could have been a staggering $237 billion
