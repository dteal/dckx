n this comic strip is playing with romantic movies and gestures used in them in such movies one often used romantic gesture is spreading rose petals in the house or apartment making a way towards the bedroom in which a romantic interest/lover is waiting surrounded by roses for a love making session the joke is that petals don't lead from the front door to the bedroom and cueball's lover but in the opposite direction instead from the bedroom out onto the street it appears that someone has set up a box of rose petals and an electric fan atop a roomba an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner as a method of automatically creating such a trail the title text suggests that despite the other party's intentions of setting this up as a joke to trick cueball cueball ended up having a lovely time with the roomba
