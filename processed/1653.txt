n the comic is a map with the rough outline of the mainland of the united states of america at first it looks like the real map but actually all the states have been shuffled around in it it seems that randall took all of the states minus alaska and hawaii the two states that are not part of this map and are only mentioned in the title text see below and then reassembled them in the style of a jigsaw puzzle with the end result being a map with a similar outline to the original unaltered mainland state map they can thus be reassembled into the real map as can be seen here see also the trivia section previously randall has played with the shapes of the united states in 1079 united shapes in that map he did two separate drawings for michigan with a mitten in the lower part and an eagle in the upper part once again in this version he has split michigan in two the lower main part the mitten just labeled michigan is on the west coast on part of california's location but the upper part is located on the east coast over new york's location and has been labeled mi upper so even without hawaii and alaska there are 49 states in this map consisting of 47 states plus the two halves of michigan in the table below all 49 states in the map has been listed to indicate where the puzzle pieces have been moved to it seems at a first glance that the names have been written on the states as they would appear in a normal map and that they have all then been rotated with the rotation of the states but this is not the case for all states for instance it seems like utah has hardly been moved at all and with the name written normally this may be intentionally to deceive the readers because utah has been turned upside down and according to how for instance texas clearly turned upside down has its name written upside down as well utah should thus also have been written like that it seems likely that this could be a trick by randall to see if anyone spots that utah has actually been moved but it could of course be a mistake as seems more likely with montana where the same error has occurred but since this state has been moved far from its real position there would be no sport in doing so see the trivia section of course there is the possibility that utah was on purpose and montana by mistake with 47 of 49 ending up rotated as expected on the map and only two exactly upside down there can be no doubt that it was on purpose that the names in general have been written according to the states rotation note that for instance the state california has been rotated but in a way so the text is written normally but due to the direction of the state it is normal to write the name tilted down along the state which just coincidentally ends up being rotated normal in the position it has in the comic california has thus only been pushed down the length of the west border of the us and thus rotated accordingly so the top part still overlaps with the bottom part california but also covers the bottom part of arizona and new mexico other states that likewise haven't been moved a lot include maine which has only been rolled left ie turned upside down to just outside its normal position colorado has been moved up a state to where wyoming usually is and wyoming has then just been shifted right still covering part of its original position but both have been turned 90 degrees whichever way would be impossible to say for these rectangular states but the text if you dare believe in that seems to indicate they have been turned counter clockwise wisconsin has only been shifted down below its usual position but then turned upside down the title text mentions how it would be unfair to use a blank version of this shuffled up map as a quiz for knowledge of us geography the link is to such a map created by a user of this site; most people recognize states primarily by their relative locations not their shape and especially not their shape after being rotated it also suggests a corresponding mean trick to play if you include alaska and hawaii which are not present in the comic itself namely to interchange the volcanic island of hawaii consisting of 8 main islands and hundreds of smaller ones with those of the aleutian islands also a chain of volcanic islands 14 large and 55 small that partly belongs to the us and partly to russia the island extends from the alaska peninsula it would thus be possible to even make it difficult to correctly name these last two states even though it would be obvious to begin with that it must be the two not belonging to the mainland
