n this comic is a parody of the star trek the next generation episode darmok in which captain picard and the enterprise crew meet with a tamarian ship they can translate the individual words of tamarian with perfect accuracy but the tamarians communicate using metaphors based on their own history and culture&#8212;without these cultural references the enterprise crew are unable to understand what the tamarians are actually saying darmok and jalad at tanagra is repeated many times in this episode by the tamarian captain dathon picard is eventually able to decipher the line to discover that it was a story of two warriors marooned on an island tanagra who work together to defeat a common foe the alien's intention is that he and picard work together to defeat a monster as a way to cement ties between the tamarians and the federation in the comic instead of suggesting a dramatic gesture to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough the alien seems to be suggesting a one night stand hence the wink in the final panel it is not clear if he is chatting up deanna troi who has the long curly hair or picard however given that in the original episode darmok and jalad the two warriors were metaphorically identified with dathon and picard it seems likely that he is flirting with picard the title text suggests that the actor patrick stewart who played captain picard might find star trek fans indecipherable in the same way that captain picard found the tamarians indecipherable this is a joke about how star trek fans stereotypically make constant references to the franchise which are so dense and obscure that even the program's actors might find them impossible to understand
