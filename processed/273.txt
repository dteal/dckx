n this panel is a play on the electromagnetic spectrum showing a large piece of the spectrum and examples of phenomena that absorb or emit light along the spectra such spectra are commonly used in physics or astronomy education contexts when discussing the nature of light this comic extends it to absurd lengths by including examples that may be variously hyper specific humorous or non em phenomena the first two scales at the bottom show the wavelength xcexbb in meters and the frequency f in hertz of the wave the values are related as xcexbb=c/f where c is the speed of light the last line showing qgalxc2xb2/coloumb is nonsense; gal gallon is a unit of liquid volume measurement and coloumb is a likely typo for coulomb the si unit of electric charge photons do not have volume in the traditional sense of the word and are electrically neutral thus carrying no charge  in 1887 the michelsonxe2x80x93morley experiment proved for the first time that the aether theory was wrong the year 1897 cited underneath the comic title may be an incorrectly dated reference to this experiment nevertheless after that time many physicists like hendrik lorentz or joseph larmor were still working on some aether theories albert einsteins theory of special relativity in 1905 helped explain the theoretical basis for lack of aether and was a definitive step in discarding previous work
