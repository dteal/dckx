n black hat being black hat is deliberately perverting a classic physics demonstration in the normal version of the demonstration a heavy ball on a pendulum is pulled to one side until it is almost but not quite touching the demonstrator or volunteer's nose or chin when the ball is released at rest it swings down and away then back up to almost the same distance in the arc from where it started xe2x80x94 but never by the laws of physics farther than where it started if the demonstrator or volunteer doesn't lean in the heavy ball will never hit them in the nose thus faith in physics means there is no reason to flinch sample videos 1 2 in this comic since cueball is not standing at the beginning edge of the ball's movement but rather at the base of its swing he is about to get a rude surprise however judging from the slack of the rope the ball should not hit cueball in the head but would almost certainly hit him lower the title text refers to the fact when someone flinches during the pendulum experiment they are commonly accused of not having faith in the laws of physics randall is rebutting this argument by stating that rather than not having faith in science he is actually in tune with it specifically the biological processes that led to the flinch reflex his eyes and his flinch reflex have been calibrated through millions of years of evolution to instantly dismiss his body's natural reaction when a heavy object comes quickly towards his face does not give enough credit to these mechanisms that successfully kept him and every one of his ancestors alive in other words while flinching may indicate doubt of the laws of physics it may equally well indicate trust in the laws of biology the idea of hitting someone else with a pendulum is also the topic of 755 interdisciplinary
