n this comic starts with philosophical musing about engineering the last panel reveals a joke about wile e coyote and the road runner a cartoon series created by chuck jones in the cartoon the coyote is constantly building odd contraptions with parts ordered from acme corporation to catch the road runner the coyote never succeeds often because his devices don't work as intended the word hubris from the comic title means extreme pride or arrogance it is a theme from the classic greek plays and is usually severely punished by the gods  the title text is implying that chuck jones would not let hubris go unpunished; the engineer might be able to construct 'better' traps than wile e but they would still be doomed to fail from the second panel murphy's law states anything that can go wrong will go wrong it was originally developed as a guideline for accident prevention starting at the design level in the common vernacular today it is interpreted more liberally if there is even the slightest chance of an unfortunate accident occurring despite all your attempts to prevent it the accident will happen anyway purely out of spite the namesake edward murphy has since evolved to mythic proportions being cast as a vengeful god of misfortune and ruin
