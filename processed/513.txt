n cueball is talking apparently to megan he confesses that he has a crush on her usually the next step when someone likes someone else is to ask the other person out but cueball takes a different route and in the comic he explains his thought process presumably he actually explains this to megan  he explains that he is afraid of rejection and so instead of asking her out directly promises to be her best friend and someone who is always there for you in the hopes that this will eventually lead to megan developing an attraction for him this way cueball does not have to risk megan saying 'no' to him as she will be led to make the first move instead cueball is aware that this may not be an ideal situation for megan conceding that she may end up changing her definition of happiness to make her feel more comfortable in the relationship while she is conscious of the fact that she doesn't really love cueball cueball recognises that if megan fell for him this way she would probably have this fact at the back of her mind forever and so after painting this elaborate but troubling future cueball asks sound good megan however is not won over by cueball's plan and tells him that she is going to date this jerk instead she could have said any name here to cueball it will always sound like jerk this suggests that she would much rather date someone else rather than date cueball whom she as he correctly implies does not love  cueball declares that the other suitor doesn't respect you an absurdly hypocritical comment given his manipulative plan he explained earlier that he would tear down the jerks you date this last line could also be him actually executing on the plan he just detailed the title text is a play on the concept of friends with benefits wherein two friends have casual sex without entering a committed relationship friends with detriments suggests that having cueball as her friend damages megan's chances of getting a relationship and sex with anyone else since cueball will tear any candidate down also despite cueball claiming to be megan's friend and appearing to value this friendship his plans are rather selfish and manipulative making him a friend who is in fact detrimental
