n this comic is a reference to the nasa mars rover curiosity landing on mars on august 5 2012 at 1031pm pdt august 6 2012 at 531am gmt nasa live streamed the landing but demand for the feed caused server issues thus the time spent trying to download the landing images could be used as an excuse for things such as being late for work falling asleep during the day or just about anything demanding one's attention the title text is a reference to torrents which are a more resilient peer to peer file sharing method due to the decentralized bittorrent protocol where the more people there are downloading a file the more available it is the name is a play on the file naming convention of release groups who name their files typically for films or television shows containing data on the file; source cam = camera capture language swesub = swedish subtitles source dvdrip = ripped from dvd encoding xvid = xvid codec and group name axxo = axxo a well known dvd movie release group given that the filename is loaded with keywords that are irrelevant for a still image file it is unlikely that this torrent will contain the expected pictures the first images received from curiosity via the odyssey orbiter were low resolution thumbnails taken from the rover's rear facing camera thus the file name curiosity rear cam_256px_x_256px
