n this comic consists of a chart where randall has plotted fruits according to two criteria ease/difficulty to eat on the horizontal axis and tastiness on the vertical axis the y axis goes from tasty at the top to untasty at the bottom the x axis goes from easy on the right to difficult on the left  for instance pineapples are deemed fairly tasty but very difficult to eat whereas seeded grapes are very tasty and somewhat easy and logically seedless grapes are roughly equally tasty but easier to eat obviously being easy to eat is preferable to being difficult and being tasty is preferable to being untasty so the best fruits regarding these two aspects only are in the top right corner and the worst in the bottom left; additionally in the top left corner are the difficult but worthy fruits and in the bottom right one the not so tasty but easy anyway ones the individual ratings of each fruit are subjective; very obviously in the case of tastiness and more subtly for difficulty randall does not explain his criteria for ranking the difficulty of each fruit and it is likely based on simply personal experiences someone who has grown up in an area where pineapples are plentiful is likely to be more adept at skillfully preparing them the discrepancies between how randall has rated certain fruits and how others believe they should have been rated caused a surprising level of controversy according to the chart grapefruit is the third hardest fruit to eat as well as the second least tasty fruit from the ones listed at least eating one of them is like spending too much of one's time and energy without much reward hence randall's quip in the title fuck grapefruit in the title text randall mentions coconuts randall mentions that he would have to put them so far down to the left on the chart not far down just far down towards the left that they would not fit in this chart he thus states that it is so much more difficult to eat especially to open coconuts than the usual mainstream fruits such as the ones plotted here if he did include coconuts in the chart the rest of the fruits would all be pushed to the right side of the chart he does not say that he does not like to eat the fruit although it has nut in its name the coconut is actually a stone fruit and thus belongs on a chart of fruit having spent half an hour trying in vain to open a coconut randall also only has one thing to say about them fuck coconuts in 1701 speed and danger another scatter plot shows exactly what happens when one point is inserted into such a plot if it is far removed from all the other points in this case even on both axes
