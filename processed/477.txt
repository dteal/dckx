n randall is writing a letter to his grandmother on a typewriter thanking her for taking him and at least one other person on a trip however due to a habit he's developed from using a computer for so long randall inadvertently litters the letter with chunks of blank space followed by website urls as if through muscle memory randall periodically attempts to check the latest news by pressing a combination involving the tab key typing the url of a specific website then pressing a combination using the tab key again on a computer the ctrl+tab keyboard combination usually switches to between browser tabs within a window such as between two firefox tabs while alt+tab switches between windows however there is only a simple tab key on an old fashioned typewriter pressing tab there doesn't switch to another screen it just moves the platen the typewriter's cursor so to speak to the next tab stop leaving a wide space before the next typing on the same piece of paper so the key combination that would satisfy randall's somewhat hyperactive impulses on a computer is dramatically different on a typewriter where that key instead causes movement of the platen so he hits the tab key types a url and hits the tab key again right in the middle of his letter it also shows randall's love of news and information websites the title text references that randall's real grandmothers upon seeing this comic might feel bad that he doesn't write to them at all xe2x80x94 not even poorly written letters like in the comic to remedy this he writes a brief thank you note to his grandmothers which includes also one ctrl/alt+tab combination
