n the trolley problem is a thought experiment often posed in philosophy to explore moral questions with applications in cognitive science and neuroethics the general version is that an out of control trolley or train is heading towards 5 people on the track who can't get out of the way on an alternative branch of the track is 1 person who can't get out of the way the trolley can be diverted by using a lever with the consequence of saving the 5 people but killing the 1 person the question posed is whether or not it is morally right to pull the lever this results of this test report that around 86% of respondents choose the utilitarian option of diverting the trolley utilitarian ethics holds that the morally correct option is that which results in the most amount of good for the greatest number of people; in this case choosing to sacrifice the 1 person for 5 people after discovering a variation on this problem posed in a strip of the saturday morning breakfast cereal webcomic which can be seen on the tablet he is carrying cueball presents it to black hat before cueball can finish explaining the problem black hat questions whether he would need to get up to reach the lever and how much it would interrupt his other activities as usual he cares nothing at all about what happens to other people this response is linked to another theory in philosophy that of self interest or egoism or objectivism in which a person will choose the action with the most benefit for them personally black hat then poses an offer he promises to divert the trolley if cueball is one of the five endangered people provided that cueball pays him $1 now again black hat is twisting the situation to his own benefit in this case monetary in the case of self interest the $1 could be the price at which black hat values his time and effort below which he feels there is no benefit to himself in pulling the lever cueball decides that there is no point posing the problem to someone like black hat and gives up this further shows that it is challenging for people with different ethical frameworks to function together without a common understanding either mutually or with one side using that understanding to motivate a mutually agreeable or horrible solution the title text follows this up by continuing black hat's offers for $5 he will not deliberately arrange this situation and for $25 he will quit looking for further incentives these attempts to exploit the thought exercise for personal gain further demonstrate black hat's cynical amorality black hat's offer makes cueball himself the subject of the trolley problem cueball now has a choice of expending $1 to save 5 people while sacrificing one person or $5 to save all 6 people of course he could dismiss the offer as a joke if not for the person making it which as we know from other comics is very much capable of such exploits
