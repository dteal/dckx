n this comic is based on a misunderstanding the null hypothesis is the hypothesis in a statistical analysis that indicates that the effect investigated by the analysis does not occur ie 'null' as in zero effect for example the null hypothesis for a study about cell phones and cancer risk might be cell phones have no effect on cancer risk the alternative hypothesis by contrast is the one under investigation in this case probably cell phones increase cancer risk after conducting a study we can then make a judgment based on our data there are statistical models for measuring the probability that a certain result occurred by random chance even though in reality there is no correlation if this probability is low enough usually meaning it's below a certain threshold we set when we design the experiment such as 5% or 1% we reject the null hypothesis in this case saying that cell phones do increase cancer risk otherwise we fail to reject the null hypothesis as we have insufficient evidence to conclusively state that cell phones increase cancer risk this is how almost all scientific experiments from high school biology classes to cern draw their conclusions it is very important to note that a null hypothesis is a specific statement relative to the current study in mathematics we often see terms such as the riemann hypothesis or the continuum hypothesis that refer to universal statements but a null hypothesis depends on context there is no  one the null hypothesis it refers to a method of statistical analysis and falsifiability not a specific hypothesis given that megan's response would probably be to facepalm
