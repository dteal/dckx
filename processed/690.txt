n the world trade center towers were destroyed on september 11 2001 9/11 in american date notation the planned attack was for two planes to collide with the north and south towers simultaneously but what ended up happening was that plane 1 hit the north tower at 846 am and the second plane hit the south tower a little less than 20 minutes later in the ensuing investigation many people raised questions that didn't seem to get a satisfactory answer for several months if not years many people who called themselves 9/11 truthers began to claim that the whole thing was a government conspiracy in what has come to be known as the controlled demolition plot referenced by the title of this comic which alleges that the towers were brought down not by the fires caused by the planes but by demolition charges intentionally placed there by the government randall proposes a compromise to make both those who believe in the conspiracy and those who don't happy since there is only a government related video of a plane flying into the north tower xe2x80x94 done by a man who was with fdny fire fighters xe2x80x94 that was a government conspiracy but it just so happened that the government decided to demolish the north tower on the same day that terrorists decided to demolish the south tower the title text is a restatement of the golden mean fallacy that the truth can be found in a compromise between two opposite positions in this comic one of the positions is a fanciful conspiracy theory and the other is a sober fact based conclusion  the error of this fallacy is apparent here as it can lead  to even more ridiculous conclusions in this case the compromise theory would make no one happy because both sides would have to concede claims which they have already dismissed as bogus as well as accept an incredibly unlikely coincidence on january 6 2016 the onion a satirical news site reported that the government has confirmed randall's theory by releasing an article titled government admits it was only behind destruction of north tower this is the first in the categorycompromise but since then randall has proposed several compromises where most will also be unlikely to be accepted
