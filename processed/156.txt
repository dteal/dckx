n when cueball asks black hat for a favor he seems to be making a rude gesture by lifting a finger towards cueball the word he says commented does however not seem to fit with the shorter four letter word usually combined with such a gesture  cueball also fails to understand this but as it turns out as the panels move around black hat and zooms in on his fingers he is not making this rude gesture but is instead actually lifting two fingers toward cueball forming a double slash and thereby ignoring both him and his question for a favour by commenting him out programming style even to the point where black hat sees the commenting out slashes cueball and anything he says in the color for ignored parts of the program or real world in this case in certain programming languages including but not limited to c since c99 c++ c# java javascript php and scala inserting a double slash // in a line marks everything after the double slash in the line as a comment; ie something for humans to read that generally helps them understand the code better rather than something for the computer to execute since all comment lines are ignored when a program is run or compiled it is possible to simply put a double slash in front of any line of code to skip that line this is known as commenting out the line an integrated development environment ide for short is an application that programmers use to write compile execute and debug code many ides color code text to make reading the code easier in ides like eclipse and microsoft visual studio a line that is commented out will be colored green however the color may vary depending on which ide you use and can usually also be customized the title text refers to this variation among ides' color schemes
