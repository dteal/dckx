n the comic presents a flyer with text typical of a ubiquitous advertisement for a weight loss program however the image at the bottom of the flyer and the text below the flyer make it clear that the flyer is actually an advertisement for a trebuchet club this unexpected meaning is meant to highlight the ambiguity of the flyer's content a trebuchet is gravity powered siege engine which was originally used to attack fortifications it works by dropping a raised counter weight to rotate a throwing arm launching a projectile on a ballistic path the phrase we'll help you hit your target by dropping 30 pounds fast is where the ambiguity is produced in the context of a weight loss ad the target would be a rhetorical device referring to the weight which one wishes to achieve in the context of a trebuchet club the target is a literal location which one is trying to hit with a projectile likewise a weight loss ad may indicate that a client could quickly lose 30 pounds ~136&#160;kg however in this context the 30 pounds being dropped is either the counter weight which is dropped to provide a trebuchet with its power implying a rather small trebuchet or the projectile itself being dropped at the target it will be slower than the counter weight but definitely still much faster than any weight loss program the only hint that the flyer advertises a trebuchet club is in the drawing at the bottom of the flyer which appears to show two individuals pondering a ballistic path towards a castle tower though no trebuchet is shown  the text below indicates that this flyer may have been too subtle the title text suggests that if the flyer is indeed too subtle a form of advertisement they will use the least subtle options of announcing their club's existence xe2x80x94 likely by using their trebuchet to attack the town see also 382 trebuchet
