n the point of this comic is that often curious children ask their parents simple questions about understanding how the world works  often although the question is simple the answer is not  why is the sky blue is a common example since most parents are not familiar with rayleigh scattering and thus are unable to answer the question randall's hobby is to make those questions even harder in order to stump the scientist parents and make them uncomfortable another point of this comic is that we often think that we understand a scientific phenomenon eg why is the sky blue; however a certain simple question eg why isn't the sky violet can often uncover large gaps in our actual understanding rayleigh scattering is the phenomenon that explains the color of the sky where light of every wavelength gets scattered in the air by the inverse quartic fourth power of its wavelength as given in the comic in the visible spectrum blue light has a wavelength of 450xe2x80x93495&#160;nm while violet has a shorter wavelength of 380xe2x80x93450&#160;nm violet light does indeed get scattered more than blue light however the lower portion of the spectrum for sunlight consists of blue light and eyes are much more sensitive to blue light than violet light this leaves the impression of a blue sky a good explanation including why blue and not violet can be found in usenet physics faq&#160; why is the sky blue but note that human color perception is more complicated than described there the title text refers to a mirror image and is discussed by the famous american theoretical physicist richard feynman in a famous bbc documentary 1 as one of the problems which he used to have fun with first years british english for first year student or freshman a mirror image is a virtual image produced by the reflection of light on a mirror in the mirror image only front and back are switched around xe2x80x94 like a printing press or a rubber stamp left and right are still left and right in an absolute reference frame xe2x80x94 wave your left arm in front of the mirror and the mirror person also waves the arm on the left side it is only when using personal reference frame xe2x80x94tied to the individualxe2x80x94 that we can say that the mirror person is moving their right arm the apparent inversion comes from the fact that the mind projects itself onto the person in the mirror to help understand why this effect happens imagine that you are holding a sign which says mix and facing a mirror initially you face the sign towards you the m is on the left and the x on the right now you turn the sign around so that the sign faces the mirror now even without paying any attention to the mirror simply because you have turned it around now the m is on the right and the x is on the left and if you could see through the back of the sign it would say xim from your perspective when you look at it in the mirror you are now able to see that orientation and it appears to read xim if instead of turning the sign around horizontally to look at it in the mirror you flipped it vertically and looked at it in the mirror it would appear to say wix in the mirror thus the mirror is only revealing how the text is oriented relative to your eyes or to put it more succinctly mirrors don't reverse left to right turning around does mirrors reverse along whatever direction is perpendicular to the plane of the mirror you can induce a mirror to reverse left and right only   by standing next to it instead of in front of it facing along the plane of the mirror itself if you lift your right arm you can clearly see your image's left arm raising without having to adjust for frame of reference similarly you can induce a mirror to reverse top and bottom only by holding it flat above your head or laying it flat on the ground and standing on it or perhaps standing under a suitably equipped bedroom ceiling
