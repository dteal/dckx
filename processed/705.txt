n in this comic we see a man talking on a phone we are unsure of his aims terrorism robbery etc but he has taken hostages and cut all links to the outside world in order to control the situation and prevent the police from observing the interior of the building as popularly depicted in film and television initially all appears to be normal for a hostage situation to the reader but then the hostage taker explains on the phone that someone has entered the building climbed the air vents to bypass their cordon effortlessly killing other hostage takers who are likely hardened killers with weaponry on his way to the server room and then ignored the hostages preferring instead to reconnect the servers to the outside world the hostage taker is evidently puzzled by this and explains it to the person on the other end of the phone who immediately recognizes the reason the man that entered the building is a sysadmin short for system administrator and he is concerned that his servers are losing uptime time spent running or connected to the internet this evidently concerns the man on the phone who knows that a good sysadmin is an unstoppable force once started this comic is a reference to one of two things or both the hollywood depiction of heroes able to perform superhuman feats in tricky situations such as john mcclane in die hard which the first two panels are a deliberate reference to or the duty that people impose upon themselves to go above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that they carry out their work in this case a dutiful sysadmin concerned for those trying to use his server the title text is a simple joke to the fact that the sysadmin will crawl through broken glass and defeat criminals/terrorists forces of darkness just so a cat blog where owners write about their cats can stay up a sysadmin is also mentioned in the title text of 309 shopping teams
