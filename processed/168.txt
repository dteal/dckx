n euphemisms are figures of speech used in place of more offensive terms in this comic cueball uses swear words in the place of benign terms inverting the typical usage of euphemisms to drop the kids off at the pool is a euphemism meaning to go take a shit in this case however cueball actually has to drop kids off at the pool but instead uses go take a shit cueball is using the euphemism in reverse hence the title  in the title text the figure is waiting for a situation in which he has to see a man concerning a horse as this relates to another euphemism meaning to urinate it can be assumed that when telling someone about seeing the man about the horse he would say then i had to go take a piss this is not to be confused with the opposite of a euphemism called a dysphemism
