n a graph is a mathematical object consisting of nodes connected by lines called edges the nodes could represent for example people and the edges could represent a connection from having slept together now megan has such a graph arguably a graph that is symmetric is nicer than a regular one which is why megan suggests that they should sleep together the title text is a small world joke on the concept of erdxc5x91s number paul erdxc5x91s was a hungarian mathematician renowned for his eccentricity and productivity he holds the world record for the number of published math papers as well as for the number of collaborative papers a person's erdxc5x91s number is the collaborative distance between the person and erdxc5x91s paul erdxc5x91s's erdxc5x91s number is 0 by definition all of his 511 collaborators have the erdxc5x91s number 1; anyone excluding erdxc5x91s who has collaborated on a mathematical or scientific paper with any of those collaborators has an erdxc5x91s number of 2 and so on thus if you have written a paper with someone who's written a paper with someone who's written a paper with paul erdxc5x91s your erdxc5x91s number is 3 if you know a mathematician or are a mathematician you can calculate his/her/your erdxc5x91s number here the collaboration graph is the graph where each edge represents two people collaborated on a mathematical paper together and the people represented are those with an erdxc5x91s number some of erdxc5x91s's colleagues have published papers about the properties of the collaboration graph treating it as if it were a real mathematical object one of these papers made the observation that the graph would have a certain very interesting property if two particular points had an edge between them to make the collaboration graph have that property the two disconnected mathematicians immediately got together proved something trivial and wrote up a joint paper explained here in 599 apocalypse cueball actually manages to write a paper with zombie erdxc5x91s thus making his erdxc5x91s numbers one
