n according to quantum mechanics there is tremendous energy density in space time itself this is known as vacuum energy zero point energy vacuum foam etc so far we don't know any way to tap this energy although it does evaporate off black holes see the xe2x80x9cwhat ifxe2x80x9d released the same week as this comic black hole moon in the cartoon beret guy appears to be making a silly mistake confusing the vacuum referred to in calculations of the theoretical energy density of space time with a vacuum cleaner which is also commonly referred to as just a vacuum cueball tries to correct him but it turns out that beret guy really is able to tap into this fundamental source of energy having such strange and impossible powers is second nature to beret guy as can be seen in many of his appearances xe2x80x93 for instance in 1388 subduction license but even though beret guy now claims the universe is his to command a sentence used by the crazy villain in many movies cueball is not fazed by this and simply asks in the title text if beret guy would use the vacuum for its intended purpose and clean the living room on an additional note many scientific breakthroughs in history have been made because the person making them did not realize they were supposedly impossible such as spin stabilized magnetic levitation this comic could be seen as a nod to that
