n cueball is presumably asked to answer the typical career counselor question what is your dream job rather than going with the more common answers that are designed to increase the chances of landing that particular job cueball talks about unrealistic jobs that are whimsical and so well compensated that a little over one hour on the clock would provide enough wealth for a luxurious retirement; of course you can have such a job only in your dreams he makes jobs out of tasks that people do when they are bored whether the tasks needed to be done or not therefore if he did not get the job he probably would have done them at some point anyway peeling lint off dryer traps can relieve boredom but it gets tedious soon so cueball wants to do that only for 5 minutes followed by an hour of holding the handle of a lightsaber against things and switching it on the energy emitted by this fictional weapon will probably burn melt or cut the object it is touching as demonstrated in a scene from star wars episode i where jedi qui gon jinn uses his lightsaber to cut through a wall in cueball's mind these are probably high paying jobs because after this he would like to retire to a life of luxury the title text is poking fun at hollywood films particularly stories about violent professions like mobsters hitmen detective or spies where the hero is retired but some unforeseen circumstance has forced them out of retirement to do one last job usually in these films the jobs are overtly improbably dangerous often with the suggestion that they may lose their lives doing it but the reward for doing the job saving the world a ton of cash an unresolved debt is just too great to refuse however in this comic the joke is that his one last job is also a mildly amusing task designed to relieve boredom
