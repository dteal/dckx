n cueball and megan are shown shopping for lamps in the first part of the comic only first frame it is at a time before online reviews could be looked up on a smartphone they spot a lamp they like check the price and agree to buy end of story but the rest of the comic shows how difficult shopping has become after reviews have become easily accessible on smartphones while standing in the store and now this takes up the final three panels with the result that no lamps have been acquired and they decide to sit in the dark using the claim that their living room looks fine in the dark to avoid buying a very expensive lamp which is the only one with perfect reviews like 100% with 5 stars out of 5  when shopping for anything via reviews whether it be electronics or even something as simple as lamps like the comic demonstrates one negative review can spoil a lot of positive reviews that hits home even more if the review is specific because humans attach more weight to anecdotes and specific stories this comic points out the absurdity of paying attention to those reviews by making the negative review itself absurd a lamp making your cats go deaf and interfering with your taste buds would imply at the very least anomalous radiation and would not be on store shelves long before some kind of serious recall  the second part of the comic starts out normal for the lamp cueball think is pretty megan finds lots of negative reviews which implies the product really isn't good after all and it was even that specific brand of lamps in general that was to be avoided but then the proceeds to get more and more absurd all the way to the title text cueball is for instance looking at  a lamp who someone thinks looks like a uterus as normal people do not really know how a uterus looks like and if cueball did not find this so himself he should ignore one persons comment on the other hand reading such a statement will maybe make you think of a uterus every time you see the lamp so now it may be best not to buy it but had he not read the comment it might have been a fine lamp for him in the final frame cueball has found a swiss lampmaker with perfect reviews but her lamps are very expensive the most cheap are staring at 1300 francs swiss francs are the units of currency used in switzerland in 2012 when the comic was released a swiss franc was a little more worth than one dollar 11$ to a swiss franc making the cheapest lamp go for not much less than us$1450 for comparison us$15 can get one a decent lamp at ikea furthermore the lampmaker lives in the swiss alps and can only be reached via a ski lift this either indicated that transportation will be very expensive on top of the high starting price or it may even indicate that they will have to go to the lampmaker personally to either acquire a lamp or maybe just to check out that they really do not look like a uterus or other parts of the human reproductive system in the title text the language spoken by the dog akkadian is an extinct semitic language that was spoken in ancient mesopotamia  even if the dog actually did speak a sentence of perfect akkadian the chance that the owner would be able to recognize it as such is negligible but apart from that the dog first went rigid and after delivering the line it was hurled out the picture window the final joke it that the worst part of this lamp was not the above mentioned crazy effects on the dog but that the lamp had completely normally the switch on the cord as opposed to having it on the body of the lamp a production argument about where to place such a switch leading to someone getting fired was part of the joke in 1741 work
