n wayne coyne the lead singer of the band the flaming lips is indeed known to crowd surf in a giant hamster ball hamster balls are a recurring subject on xkcd starting with 152 hamster ball which in direct relation to this comic showed that cueball's biggest and only wish is such a ball when cueball's cueball like friend tells him about wayne's hamster ball surfing cueball says let's go suggesting they should go and steal that hamster ball from wayne  the rest of the comic outlines an elaborate mission to acquire a human sized hamster ball by infiltrating a music concert and stealing the hamster ball while it is in use thus also kidnapping the rock star who would be structurally powerless to fight back while trapped within a spherical object at least four cueball like guys help with the mission at the concert one keeping the crowd back and the other three pushing the hamster ball into the waiting truck where a fifth friend acts as the driver when they escape with their heist the title text is one of randall's many open promises it almost certainly has not been fulfilled but people may have attempted to kidnap wayne coyne he is very friendly though and will supply both the one who brings him the hamster ball with a t shirt as well as give one to wayne it is later revealed in 577 the race part 1 that cueball paid a large settlement for this heist
