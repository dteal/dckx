n this cartoon is a romantically mature musing about time and how even though we may not always realize it the progression of time is one of the better things in life to accurately describe the world requires at minimum three spatial dimensions and the fourth dimension time the spatial dimensions don't necessarily have to be the familiar cartesian system forward/backward right/left up/down but can be described in many ways like the spherical or cylindrical system in spite of the fact that we are being pushed around the universe by being on earth we can exercise some control over these spatial dimensions by moving and therefore our trajectory through these dimensions are not inexorable impossible to stop as we only can go one direction in time and have no way of changing the speed we also are figuratively being pushed through time and this movement is inexorable cueball sits under a tree un moving with megan simply enjoying the passage of time and says of the four dimensions i could have spent my life being pushed inexorably forward through i guess time isn't the worst all of this amounts to an unusually erudite way for cueball to say he feels content with how his life has turned out despite the natural doubts one has as they get older in the title text cueball then continues to muse about his favorite dimensions and places time in his top three dimensions this means that one of the three spatial dimensions must be his least favorite though it is impossible to determine how he defines his favorite dimensions as dimensions can be defined somewhat arbitrarily they likely are length height and time as comics only use these three time being represented by panels since rising steadily and digging downward are both pretty lethal one could assume that randall's least favorite dimension is up/down see also the one of my favorite halves comment in 1556 the sky previously randall has made a comic about a man who was pushed sideways xe2x80x94 so he was pushed both through time and fell sideways 417 the man who fell sideways
