n randall is comparing the ways different people look at choosing between similar products in the first example which randall considers bad two non nerds look at two products without a description of any kind and instantly decide which one they want in the second example which is considered good one of the two is a nerd and the other one is a non nerd the non nerd instantly picks one of the products but the nerd evaluates the two and decides that the other one is better because it's a better deal in both the first two cases the pair are able to easily come to a decision however in the third example two nerds are comparing the two boxes and both of them over analyse the various merits and drawbacks on each of the two boxes they are still there two hours later unable to reach a clear agreement on which of the two boxes they wish to buy one nerd comments that their definition of value is unclear suggesting the discussion has gone on for so long because they are re evaluating their definitions over something too trivial some might perceive this as typical nerd behaviour over analysing a problem which is in actual fact quite trivial such as the decision whether to buy one box or the other virtually identical box the non nerd woman from the second situation or perhaps the store manager in this situation who has watched the two nerds compare the two products for hours attempts to put this into perspective by pointing out that an unclear definition of value is not their main problem the implication is that their real main problem is that they are unable to reach an agreement on something that makes so little difference or their problem could be the one described in 1445 efficiency the title text suggests that randall entered a similar situation attempting to buy an air conditioner with his sysadmin short for system administrator the sysadmin is a person in an organisation employed to manage the computer system or network a role which requires technical skills and intelligence the suggestion here is that a computer programmer like randall put together with a sysadmin would spend as much attention to detail as the two nerds in the comic labouring over which of two trivially similar products to buy randall deals with sysadmins again in 705 devotion to duty
