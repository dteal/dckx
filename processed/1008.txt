n megan and cueball are playing a card game maybe dominion or magic the gathering and megan whips a common insult a play on the word suck that adds a typical city name suffix to the end of it other variations are losertown lameville etc the phrase is originally based on the ubiquitous signage you see along roads that say welcome to town x xe2x80x94 population y then since cueball one ups megan by indicating there is a city by that name she can only resign herself to the fact that her smack talk did not work the title text informs the reader that suckville is classified as part of the detroit area despite not being located there detroit of course is the quintessential example of a city so run down it might as well really be named suckville or include a district of that name in fact the city only recently 2013 declared itself bankrupt fun fact looking in the factfinder suckville is corrected to saukville wisconsin which is indeed not particularly close to detroit michigan however the population of saukville in the 2010 census is given as 4451 for the village and 1755 for the surrounding town municipality
