n your mom jokes could be considered an example of fraternity humor and are seen by most adults as being a sign of immaturity especially when overused they generally involve the speaker making indelicate references to the mother of the person to whom he is speaking for examples of your mom jokes see your mom  they are a distinct variation from the more traditional yo momma jokes as in yo mamma is so fat or yo mamma is so stupid which are merely insulting that's what she said is a supposedly funny retort to an innocent looking statement the intent being to recast it in a sexual light it gained its most recent surge of popularity as michael scott's catchphrase on the television series the office xkcd contains only failed attempts at that's what she said jokes such as 436 how it happened the phrase is a simplified version of the older british expression said the actress to the bishop  we enter in the middle of a conversation between cueball and megan about the status of their relationship megan has apparently just said that cueball turns every conversation into a your mom joke and it's becoming unbearable cueball somewhat self destructively immediately turns that sentence into a your mom joke  when megan makes it clear that she has had enough and that she is leaving cueball in a heroic effort to make things even worse can only respond with the that's what she said joke  megan agrees with cueball that it is exactly what she megan said and is obviously about to depart his life forever the title text stretches the joke further cueball suggesting that many men have been with her mother but perhaps as a last resort or under duress this is if possible even more offensive than his previous efforts
