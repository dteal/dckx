n       this explanation may be incomplete or incorrect more on latin conjugationif you can address this issue please edit the page thanks  while walking megan tells cueball that in inflected languages  such as german  changes in the spelling of a word changes its meaning in a predictable way megan exemplifies this with how plural forms of nouns are created by sticking an 's' at the end and past tense of a verb is done by the suffix 'ed' megan then explains that this works well in languages which build on alphabets  she continues to explain that their language family belongs to those that are inflected but the english branch is becoming less inflected than it used to be specifically this explains why english does not have so many latin conjugations a conjugation is a pattern of inflections describing how a particular group of verbs is altered from its root form to represent different grammatical cases  only verbs have conjugations are conjugated nouns pronouns and adjectives are described by declensions and are declined  all inflected languages can be described by conjugations and declensions although latin is one of the most commonly cited perhaps because latin grammar was taught for centuries by monotonous rote learning of the conjugations and declensions a typical latin conjugation would be the verb amare to love     present active indicative    singular       plural      latin   english     latin   english    1st person   'amo'   i love     'amamus'   we love    2nd person   'amas'   thou lovest     'amatis'   you love    3rd person   'amat'   he/she/it loveth     'amant'   they love   the english singular uses archaic forms to highlight the number and person  a complete conjugation includes all the tenses present imperfect future  both voices active &amp; passive and both moods indicative &amp; subjunctive  other parts of speech infinitive participles gerunds and so forth are needed to completely define the verb but are not usually considered to be part of the conjugation cueball then asks could that mean that english writing might be ripe to become more pictographic instead of using traditional words megan replies with three emojis thumbs up like applause and a smiley  thus showing a pictographic version of the writing which has become more popular in the last years emoji has become a recurrent theme on xkcd the writing systems of many languages have both pictographic and ideographic origins pictographic means that they are pictures of some thing that will remind the reader of either the pronunciation or the meaning of the word the letter 'a' for example originated from a word meaning ox but was meant to remind readers of the glottal stop it wasn't until the ancient greeks who didn't have the glottal stop as a distinct phoneme got a hold of the phoenician version that it was transferred to the vowels it is today 'ideographic' means that they are designed through pictures to illustrate some idea an example would be a no smoking sign where a red circle with a diagonal line is an abstract representation of 'no' in fact the three emojis used in the third panel of this cartoon are all ideographic not pictographic under this definition thumbs up like applause and the smiley are all emojis that remind us of a concept of approval egyptian hieroglyphics contain many pictorial elements some of which are pictographic in the sense that they are meant to represent the thing that they picture but many are more abstract ideographic or are used for their phonetic value as 'a' was used in early alphabetic systems similarly in the chinese character writing system many of the elements have pictographic or ideographic origins; but they are often and even usually combined in ways that are phonetic and not related to the pictures that were the origins of the characters early modern english think shakespeare or the kjv bible used more forms for the tenses than we do today which can help illustrate the trend away from inflected forms in contrast verbs in english today are often conjugated with auxiliary verbs see below for a details on modern verb conjugation in english the title text points out that some intentional misspelling are used in internet slang to alter the meaning of a word what becomes wat to express confusion disgust or disbelief  the title text also uses typographical variation to emphasize the word more by using all capital letters such emphasis is difficult to show with inflected language alone this comic is referenced at 4500 bce in huge chart of 1732 earth temperature timeline according to that comic it was at that time inflection was invented but just to tease future students so they have to remember a zillion verb endings
