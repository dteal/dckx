n contrails short for condensation trails are trails of vapor produced by aircraft exhaust trailing the airplane they are formed from water condensing on jet fuel exhaust particles some impurities of which provide bases for ice crystals to accumulate on some can dissipate in minutes but others can last for hours or even longer depending on the temperature relative humidity and wind conditions at that particular altitude long lasting contrails is a sign of high relative humidity and may sometimes predict the formation of clouds and rain the chemtrail conspiracy theory claims that contrails lasting unusually long are actually chemical or biological agents sprayed into the air for sinister purposes there is no evidence such a thing is happening here white hat notices that there are a lot of contrails in the air cueball corrects him saying that in american english contrails are called chemtrails which is incorrect this is a comic in the my hobby series some of these comics involve cueball giving misleading information about pedantic terms such as 1405 meteor another of these comics 966 jet fuel even mentions chemtrails saying that they are made of mind control agents carried on board the planes that make them the title text includes a similar situation implying that astronomy and astrology are synonymous with astrology being the term used in british english however this is incorrect astronomy is the scientific study of things in outer space like stars planets and galaxies whereas astrology is a system that infers a person's personality and characteristics from those same things in outer space though both involve studying celestial objects astrology is considered a pseudoscience rather than an empirical science the joke is that british english and american english use different terms to refer to the same object and one can often learn new words for a simple thing this however is not the case in this comic; contrail and chemtrail do not refer to the same thing the latter being only a subtype of the former and it being xkcd we can assume that chemtrail is a term that is frowned upon thus the comic states it as misinformation this new found hobby is developing to another hobby about spreading misinformation that was released less than two month after this 1697 intervocalic fortition
