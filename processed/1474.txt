n appliance makers sometimes use strange screw heads to hinder attempts from users to remove appliance covers users usually have handy screwdrivers for the first two screw types drawn phillips and flat more advanced users usually have some less standard drivers such as torx or allen however appliance makers keep designing increasingly strange screw heads and users keep acquiring increasingly strange screwdrivers the comic is about the frustration a user may feel when faced with a screw for which they have no screwdriver usually the user will try to fit one of the drivers they have handy into the strange screw leading to damaging the screw and/or the driver and/or the person wielding the tool the types of screws listed are the following    screw type   description    phillips head   phillips screw drive and its corresponding screw head is one of the most recognizable types of screw heads that is commonly used in construction this type of screw head was named after its inventor a us businessman henry f phillips neither the inventor nor his invention have any relationship to the dutch electronics manufacturing company with similar but not exactly the same name philips    flat head    slot head screws are frequently erroneously referred to as flat heads a flat head screw refers in fact to the shape of the screw head regardless of the shape of the drive socket the slot head is also commonly used in construction although the diagram shows the slot truncated the slot almost always runs across the entire head of the screw as in the case of the uranium screw below    uh oh maybe it's on amazon star shaped screw   manufacturers sometimes use screws that require special screwdrivers in order to prevent the customer from opening the product the reference to amazon is presumably a suggestion to search amazoncom for the screwdriver a number of star shaped screw heads exist notably the six pointed torx and apple's rounded pentalobe screw although there is no popular design that uses the 5 pointed star shape depicted in the comic torx screws are common in automotive applications xe2x80x94 phillips heads are designed to cam out at high torque to protect the screw whereas torx do not xe2x80x94xc2xa0and on bicycles where a higher tightening torque is needed than hex screws can support they are also commonly used on disk brake mounts and in smartphones    cursed1 phillips head   the head of a screw can be stripped by overuse tightening the screw too much using the wrong size screwdriver or other misuse as the driving surfaces wear away removing the screw becomes more difficult and the added pressure needed to drive the screw usually damages it further the addition of cursed and1 in the titles is a reference to various role playing games eg dungeons and dragons where magical cursed items appear frequently this often makes the cursed equipment in the case of armor or weapons incredibly difficult to remove as it will cling to the wielder similarly the cursed phillips head screw becomes difficult to remove due to the stripped head alternatively this may imply that the damage to the screw head was caused because the screw is cursed and therefore difficult to remove the1 refers to the damage of the screw head in role playing games items such as weapons and armor may have an enchantment with a positive enchantment making the item more effective and a negative enchantment making the item less effective negatively enchanted items are often also cursed as is the case with this screw head the1 does not appear to be a reference to a philips bit size number as those are always positive notably the stripped screw bears a resemblance to a pozidriv head a modified version of the phillips head designed to resist slipping and subsequent stripping using a phillips head screwdriver in a pozidriv screw is very likely to damage the screw head and cause a real pozidriv screwdriver to no longer mate correctly     crap it's a rivet   a rivet is not a screw it is a permanent fastener which is secured by deforming the body of the fastener rivets cannot be removed with a screwdriver they must be drilled out some bolts also have rounded rivet style heads though with no means of gripping them    phillips head ruiner actually a hex screw   a reference to the fact that hex socket screws can in a pinch be removed with a phillips screwdriver rather than the intended allen wrench but this will likely ruin the screwdriver in the process    uranium screw   uranium screws were used in the construction of nuclear weapons during the twentieth century multiple radially extending short wave like lines around the screw head symbolize radiant energy output although real uranium screws were most likely made of depleted uranium which is 40 percent less radioactive than raw naturally occurring uranium    phillip's head   this is a morbidly literal interpretation of the misuse of an apostrophe in phillip's head this screw is actually a bloody bag containing the severed head of someone named phillip intentionally or otherwise this last punchline could be described as a mind screw   hex bolt title text  a hex bolt has six external sides so it could in theory be held by squeezing two screwdriver shafts together with the bolt in between the amount of force on the two screwdriver shafts needed to turn the hex bolt will probably exceed the strength of human hands the attempt would most likely only result in causing your hands to cramp or causing the screwdrivers to slip and cause further injury
