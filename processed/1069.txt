n this comic is mainly a joke on the traditional pick up line that goes baby if i could rearrange the alphabet i'd put 'u' and 'i' together ie you and i or the letter u and the letter i however in typical xkcd fashion rather than continuing with that tired pickup line cueball jumps at his hypothetical chance to rearrange the alphabet and fix the english orthography an orthography is a standardized system for using a particular writing system script to write a particular language including rules of spelling the english orthography happens to be one of the deepest that is most irregular ones around since almost every sound can be spelled in several ways and most spellings and all letters can be pronounced in more than one way and often in many different ways so faced with this opportunity the hooking up could wait restructuring the alphabet and creating a sensibly regular english spelling is the chance of a lifetime and would make history making cueball immortal in the sense of living on forever in memory as the alphabet fixer the 'k/c' situation is about the use of the letter 'c' it doesn't have a unique sound and most often make a 'k' sound or an 's' sound combined with an 'h' it usually makes the 'ch' sound in chair but also they often sound like 'k' character and in not too few cases they even make the 'sh' sound1 so a reasonable change cueball might make is to replace 'c' by 'k' or 's' and keep 'c' only followed by 'h' or even giving 'c' the current sound of 'ch' as in chair orthography was again the subject in 1562 i in team
