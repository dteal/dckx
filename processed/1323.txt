n alice bob and eve are role names traditionally used in describing cryptographic protocols rather than talking about person a person b person c names beginning with each letter are used instead and giving them different genders let pronouns be used to shorten discussions for example person a sends person b a message encoded with person b's public key is much easier to parse when written as alice sends bob a message encoded with his public key eve is short for eavesdropper a person trying to find out what's being said in the conversations between the other people the classic situation involves alice wanting to send a secret message to bob while eve the eavesdropper attempts to read the message ideally without alice or bob ever finding out additional participants such as carol person c can be added if necessary the list of names has become very standardised over time as described at alice and bob the joke here is that any computer scientist hearing the names used will think that they are listening to a cryptography problem by changing the names in a story to these role names you can induce them to listen carefully to boring stories the fewer the interesting details the more it sounds like a general problem so very boring stories are actually the easiest the title text shows a more radical approach to the problem for people who do not feel comfortable about lying in this approach you only make friends with people who have the appropriate names already the comic title also can be interpreted in two ways first the computer scientist thinks the conversation is about an encryption protocol second the way the conversation is carried resembles a protocol used by many data communication systems where one side sends data while the other sends back an acknowledgement upon receiving the data in this case the data are the lines of the boring story in comic 177 alice and bob these names are used in the same context instead of alice and bob being perfectly innocent people who just want to communicate in private bob is actually having an affair with alice eve xe2x80x94his former partnerxe2x80x94 cracked the encryption to see what the message contained thus this comic seems to continue the alice/bob romance jealous eve plot with eve apparently confronting alice over her text message to bob
