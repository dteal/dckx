n cueball has obtained a new license plate the license plate number one receives is often the next in sequence available at the time and place of registration however in many localities for an additional fee one can select his or her own personalized license plate number called a vanity plate subject to certain criteria and availability in this comic cueball has elected to purchase the personalized license plate number 1i1 iii1 or one letter i one dash letter i letter i letter i and one he believes the ambiguity between the letter i and the digit 1 on the plate will make it very difficult for anyone to correctly identify his vehicle if he commits a crime some localities have more distinct 1 and i characters in their license plate font than others but often when a crime is committed witnesses only has a short time to look at the plate and will then be confused in principle his idea did work cause when the police end up interviewing a witness of a crime scene in the end of the comic he can only say that it the thief's license plate was all 1s or something what cueball does not count on is that there are no other license plates made up entirely of the letter i and the digit 1 thus when witnesses report a vehicle with a license plate of either/or i's and 1's the police know exactly who the perpetrator is  given the fact that the police still haven't caught him even though they have his address written on a post it note in their car it seems like they had already though of the same idea and when cueball registered such a license plate they put up the address in the police cars as they expected him to begin committing crimes he may already have committed more than one but they would soon stop him before it turned into a crime spree someone in new hampshire appears to have done this in real life the title text appears to be a conversation between cueball and the police the next day when they show up at his address it turns out that the the police suspect cueball of six bank robberies cueball responds that all he did was vandalize the library but the police disregards this as a nice try to avoid being arrested because witnesses saw a his license plate with all 1's and i's was used  cueball does not understand this because he was with his car the entire time since he got the license plate and just as he says this he has an epiphany and states wait ok wow that was clever of her it is thus clear that he suspects that megan have made a false license plate also with only a combination of i's and 1's and then she has robbed six banks knowing that the police would be sure to suspect cueball who was so foolish to show his criminal intent by registering such a plate in the first place  knowing that the police will assume the car is his she has thus framed him hopefully for cueball he can prove he was not involved in the robberies but the polices certainty that they knew who the stupid guy was that committed the crimes they may not have taken so much care in collecting evidence the first day of the crimes and this will have given megan time to run away with all the money as no one was looking for her so she may well have left the country with no one looking for a woman this will make it more difficult for cueball to avoid the blame it is clear that megan would not be so stupid as to register another plate because then they would know that there could be more than one criminal person also she would not have had time to get it if the crime spree began soon after cueball showed the plate to her but if the fake plate makes people tell about the 1s and is then the police would not ask further and maybe discover that the plate might have looked fake note the yellow police line seems to say police strip do not cross where  police line do not cross seems to be the only sentence used normally unless it is crime scene do not cross but that also does not fitof course this could be a pun about the fact that this occurance is a comic strip
