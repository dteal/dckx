n in this comic cueball appears to be hosting a show or be in an ad giving out kitchen advice he starts with a reasonable tip to use a meat thermometer instead of guessing when meat is cooked his later tips though are little more than telling how to complete normal kitchen activities performed using common sense moreover in most cases he repeats if you're anything like me suggesting he's actually done these things in his kitchen this is a parody of many commercials and infomercials that imply their consumers have no basic motor skills or common sense in order to make their product more appealing the first tip he gives is reasonable because though the use of a meat thermometer is fairly well known not everybody goes to the trouble of using one to determine if meat is done cooking one can either guess or use a meat thermometer to check that the internal temperature has reached the correct level to render meat safe for consumption many people don't own a meat thermometer and rely on an alternative solution that doesn't require special equipment such as testing by feel cutting the meat open to check its doneness checking the color of the juices after pricking the meat with skewer or simply guessing the second panel shows that cueball throws away dishes and buys new ones every time they are used this is perfectly normal if the plates are disposable plates made of paper or styrofoam but we see his trashcan is filled with chipped glasses and ceramic plates naturally this would be a very expensive practice the virtually universal chore of washing the dishes is one cueball presumes the audience is heretofore unaware of cooking on a stove is typically done placing the food into a pot or pan which is placed on the burner cueball seems to suggest that the use of a pan is a tip most people would be unaware of suggesting that most people cook eggs directly on the burners themselves a method that is likely to burn the food and create a great mess  cueball's stove has t shape raised burners probably gas but might be electric making the task very impractical though owners of glass top electric stoves could conceivably cook directly on the glass surface ice is usually made by filling an ice cube tray with water and leaving it in a freezer for several hours cueball however sprays a hose directly into his freezer compartment and quickly slams the door shut to trap some water inside this would work somewhat better in the type of freezer that has a door on the top so it could be filled with water and the door would not need to be closed to trap the water inside while this unorthodox method will make ice it will result in a large sheet of ice on the bottom of the freezer more importantly it will also make it impossible to actually use the freezer to hold anything else unless you were to put anything in beforehand and you don't mind breaking through a block of ice to get it out also ice expands as it cools it is one of the few substances with a negative coefficient of thermal expansion and its expansion might push the freezer door open the title text a household tip suggests using toilet paper a few sheets at a time which is how most people use it cueball however seems to suggest that most people use the entire roll as a single object without unspooling it and then flushing it whole using at least one roll each time they use the bathroom this is economically impractical and is prone to clogging the toilet and the plumbing if you throw the toilet paper away by putting it into the toilet and flush it for more household tips like the one in the title text see the sequel to this comic 1715 household tips this comic is clearly related to the protip category but as the exact word is not mentioned in this comic so it cannot itself be given this category
