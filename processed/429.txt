n cueball is fantasizing about being together with megan a girl he really wishes to be with but he has so far not found any way to make this happen however in his fantasy the imaginary versions of himself and megan quickly realize how impossible their relationship would be first of all neither of them can remember why they are together a typical trait of dreams that you are suddenly in some situation but cannot remember what went before also megan seems to find it very difficult to imagine them being together although the reasons are left unstated it is clear that it is actually cueball who cannot himself imagine a situation that would make megan want to be with him and he projects this into the thoughts of his fantasy version of megan he himself mentions the word fantasy which makes her realize that they are objects in a fantasy or dream that will soon end and then so will they then she decides to destroy the fantasy world they are in instead of going quietly as she would have once this fantasy ended she goes for burning it to the ground and the fantasy cueball is with her since he has also realized that he will lose her when this fantasy ends rather than allow cueball's idle daydream to end romantically they run rampant and bring his fantasy crashing to a halt  this leaves the real cueball confused but in the title text cueball realizes that he would only appreciate a girl who refused such an irrational reality thus the fantasy is consistent with both of their personalities another thought bubble comic can be seen in 248 hypotheticals
