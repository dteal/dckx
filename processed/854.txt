n this comic shows the plight of randall who occasionally motivates himself to cook after buying ingredients and cooking them the food always ended up either tasted kinda good or not good therefore although he puts the leftovers in the fridge hours later he orders pizza instead of eating the leftovers this is one of many flowchart comics a few days later he first throws away the leftovers and some weeks later also the unused ingredients after some months he is motivated again to cook more and the loop repeats this discontinued effort may be part of the reason his cooking does not improve much over time the title text describes that buying ingredients for a single meal might be more expensive than eating at a restaurant but it would be compensated if there are enough leftovers to eat again from it or cook several meals of course this idea is vitiated if he gives up cooking after a single try and throws away all remaining food
