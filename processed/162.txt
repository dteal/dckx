n a moving object like the earth has momentum momentum is the mass size of the object multiplied by the velocity speed of the moving object so the earth moving around the sun has a very high momentum because the earth has a large mass size and is moving at a high velocity speed a moving object has to keep moving at the same velocity for its momentum to stay the same the momentum of a moving object can increase decrease or stop via the force of another object force is the transfer of momentum from one object to another megan attempts to slow down the earth's momentum and spins counter clockwise to force her momentum onto the earth so that she can spend more time with the one she loves of course the few nanoseconds gained by her spinning aren't enough to give her more time with cueball because she spends her time spinning instead of being with cueball the earth has a massively high momentum and the momentum that she produces is minuscule relative to the earth's and the title text implies that this isn't possible while not being able to reverse time enjoy your night time sunrise always comes too early the total duration of a human lifetime is measured in physical time the total duration of a human life is constantly depleting at a constant velocity so even if she were able to slow down physical time that would not increase the total duration of a human lifespan  her attempt and her feat of overcoming the seemingly impossible is grand; and culturally we value this kind of high romanticism later in 442 xkcd loves the discovery channel the same kind of spinning megan is used in the first frame to tell that xkcd loves momentum technical notes angular momentum depends on the axis used for measuring angular momentum
