n this graph shows the levels of drought over time in the state of california using years on the horizontal axis and distance along a 45 degrees rotated north south axis of california on the vertical axis the image illustrates the use of the distance measure on the vertical axis by visually rotating and stacking multiple maps of california next to each other the geography of california lends itself well to this kind of graphical interpretation because the state is much taller than it is wide hence large scale phenomena like weather patterns are likely to cover much of the width of the state but only part of the height because the variation in the west east direction will be small a side on view of the state can be used as the vertical axis in a graph so that the indicated values are either the average or extreme value across the width of california randall compiled the data in this graph from data from the us drought monitor which is authored by richard tinker from noaa the colors randall uses correspond to drought intensity levels d0 d4 defined on the drought monitor site the darkest most severe level of drought is labelled ludicrous causing laughter because of absurdity but a parenthetical remark indicates that the official term is exceptional of course with half or more of the state in this condition it can hardly be called exceptional any longer the graph shows that in 2000 2005 and 2010 there were very little or no drought conditions in california but that the intervening periods have seen increasingly severe droughts according to the most recent data the state is entirely in a condition of severe or worse drought with ludicrous conditions across approximately half its area the graph also reveals that 2014 is the first year since 2000 where the ludicrous level has been seen indeed a comic about drought is rather topical california is in the middle of one of its worst droughts in recorded history the title text is a reference from the movie spaceballs a parody of various sci fi movies lone starr and barf in their winnebago space ship traveling at lightspeed are passed by spaceball one which is traveling at ludicrous speed the path of spaceball one is shown as a plaid pattern and barf remarks they've gone to plaid youtube clip
