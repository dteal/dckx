n prior to the events in this comic cueball has evidently told megan that he made an assumption about something megan starts to respond with a takeoff on the modern proverb when you assume you make an ass out of you and me this proverb plays on the fact that the word assume may be broken down into the letters ass u and me and is intended to suggest that one should not make assumptions because they may turn out to be wrong and make those involved appear foolish however when megan evokes the proverb in the modified form you know what happens when you assume cueball astutely points out that her phrasing itself is hypocritical in that it makes the assumption that he knows what happens when you assume megan stops to ponder cueball's point to which cueball responds check and mate a common phrase originating from chess xe2x80x94 suggesting triumph or having successfully countered another person's argument to which there can be no retort in part cueball's response demonstrates that in life we make assumptions almost every time we speak this only tends to be problematic in the few instances where the assumption is wrong the title text is a play on the original assume pun breaking down the word assert into ass and ert with ert being an acronym for emergency response team this comic follows a pattern similar to 1657 insanity
