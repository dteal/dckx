n note a flawed version of this comic was posted at first and then quickly a correct version was uploaded but this gave rise to several misunderstandings and confusion see the trivia section below this comic is a flowchart style like many interestingly the first option do you like flowcharts loops back to itself if you say yes as the yes lines of other options point to the type of graph they describe for example the yes line of do you like line graphs points to a line graph this may be interpreted as a recursive reference to the flowchart itself although it points to the option itself rather than the start node also this may cause the reader who actually likes flow charts to go into an endless loop of choosing yes until they are so annoyed by flowcharts that they do not like them anymore and can progress by saying no after asking about flowcharts the reader is asked whether they like line graphs if they follow the yes line it becomes a line graph where time is the x axis and your happiness is the y axis and shows that your happiness increases with time if you don't like line graphs they are asked the same question about scatter plots where again the lines turn into the points and the axis of such a plot taking yet another line the reader is asked charge a battery if they follow the line marked yes they are asked whether they are a/c or d/c current and are led to a portion of the flowchart which resembles a circuit diagram of a rectifier bridge with a battery connected to it if the reader follows the no line they are asked if they like spirals if they choose no they are asked to take the path of least resistance this part of the flowchart resembles a circuit diagram and the word resistance is a pun because resistance can have several meanings in electricity it is an electrical quantity that measures how the device or material impedes the electric current flow through it going left is the never option which goes through extra resistors and a diode therefore making the yes option the path of least resistance however when asked if you choose the path of least resistance and answers never it could also mean that you do not try to avoid a little trouble whether they choose yes or no they arrive at do you like when people find the golden spiral in random images if they choose yes the line fades into a drawing of a golden spiral and we see that the flowchart is structured around it if they choose no they are asked if they are tired of flowcharts if not they are taken to the beginning to start over again if they are tired the line points to the random button on the xkcd website the title text and the faint image of a golden spiral parody the fact that the golden spiral is superimposed on nearly everything the golden spiral is a spiral that has the growth rate of the golden ratio a number that has inspired both artists and mathematicians alike however people try to find the golden ratio in seemingly random objects and they fall to confirmation bias when drawing a golden spiral on top that seemingly fits the comic links to 1 where one can see exactly that  golden spirals randall found in random photographs this may be a spoof of the viral video illuminati confirmed the limit of consecutive terms of the fibonacci sequence is equal to the golden ratio so it matches up almost perfectly for a good reason unlike the coincidental matchings of the pictures in the mobile site link this comic bears reminiscence of 730 circuit diagram although it is not exactly the same idea
