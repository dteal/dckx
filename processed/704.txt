n cueball's friend who also looks like cueball explains the principle of explosion a classical law of logic that says that if you start out with propositions axioms that contradict each other it is possible to derive prove any statement you want in the language you are working in true or false  cueball then proceeds to misinterpret perhaps intentionally that you can derive any fact about the physical world his formula of propositional logic in the third panel reads p and not p where xe2x88xa7 is the formal logic symbol for and and xc2xac is the symbol for not p stands for a proposition as p and not p is shorthand for p is both true and false this forms a contradiction from which the principle of explosion can begin humorously and to his friend's bewilderment he then successfully manages to 'derive' the phone number for his friend's mom   an example from math if you assume that xe2x88x9a2 is a rational number you can 'prove' things that are obviously false such as the fact that some numbers must be both even and odd consequently you can draw the conclusion that xe2x88x9a2 must be an irrational number provided such a thing exists at all luckily it does and obeys the same calculation rules as for rational numbers; this is how proof by contradiction works  this can be seen in a truth table      p   xc2xacp   p xe2x88xa7 xc2xacp   p xe2x88xa7 xc2xacp xe2x87x92 q    t   f   f   t    f   t   f   t  the formula p xe2x88xa7 xc2xacp xe2x87x92 q is true in every possible interpretation no matter what propositions are substituted for p and q the implication is true so if a single example of a contradiction were found then every proposition would be true and simultaneously false  after deriving the phone number cueball instantly calls his friends mom who turns out to be mrs lenhart she asks cueball out without any preamble to his friend's vexation it does not get better when it is obvious that she wishes to drink cheap boxed wine with him and cueball is free tonight there is definitely a hint of mrs robinson over mrs lenhart here  maybe it is miss lenhart who has married or she is the mother of both miss lenhart and cueball's friend she could in fact be cueball's school teacher he obviously knew her name and is ready to go to her place in an instant in the title text we hear more of cueball's one sided conversation with mrs lenhart she asks him to pick up waffle cones a variety of ice cream cone and when he sounds bewildered by this she explains that it is for drinking the wine this is probably not a very good idea since waffles are typically not water proof and would also dissolve into the wine but it could also be considered kinky; something mrs lenhart's son would not like to hear about the rest of the title text is just more of the main comic's derivation joke since cueball will use a second to derive her son's credit card number so he can buy the cones at his expense of course we have no proof that he is actually speaking to mrs lenhart it could just be a prank he is pulling on his annoying mathematically interested friend all he needed was to have looked her phone number up in advance
