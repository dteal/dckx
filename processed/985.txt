n senator grayton is a fictional character made up for this comic which is unusual for xkcd which typically uses real world references the issues that grayton supports  tax breaks to drunk drivers grayton proposes giving those who have been convicted of a dui or dwi ie driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated money back on their taxes when those infractions are typically severely penalized as drunk driving has resulted in numerous deaths predator drones and the war on christmas the war on christmas is not a real war; it is simply the perception by some christians that non christians are trying to replace traditional christmas imagery with more inclusive and generic holiday customs no politicians have explicitly announced their support of the war on christmas and the idea that one would not only do so but would also want to use drones xe2x80x94ostensibly to harm or possibly kill peoplexe2x80x94 in the effort is an absurd exaggeration of a relatively harmless culture war  the term percentage point is used to overcome an abiguity when comparing two percentages assuming an original sample of 1000000 people where 20% approve of senator grayton  reduction of a stated number by a percentage  when the original value is given as a number there is no ambiguity in the statement below the only possible conclusion is that now only 162000 people approve of grayton previously 200000 people approved of senator grayton and then his approval rating dropped by 19%   reduction of a percentage by a percentage  when the original approval rating is given as a percentage 20% in the comic then a reduction of 19% has two possible meanings 1 of the 20% who previously approved 200000 people 19% no longer approve in this case the result is 162000 as in the above example 2 compared to the original results 19% fewer of the entire original sample of 1 million people approve in this case only 1% of the original 1 million approve equal to 10000 people  if using the second method of comparing percentages the approvals rating should be described as having dropped by 19 percentage points in reality the distinction between the two methods is often overlooked leading to confusion the caption's issue with percentage versus percentage points is that if grayton's 20% approval rating drops by 19% that means that his support has only dropped 38 percentage points since 19% of 20% is only 38% that would mean that even after all his outrageous statements his support dropped only from 20% to 162% however if the news reports that his 20% approval rating dropped 19 percentage points that means his support has dropped to 1% which appears to be more accurate given grayton's egregious policy decisions and the description of his campaign as having imploded references in the title text  tracy morgan is an actor who plays tracy jordan in the tv show 30 rock he has been reprimanded for controversial comments on homosexuals and sarah palin in separate incidents john wilkes booth is the person who assassinated abraham lincoln he was a confederate sympathizer and supported slavery the time cube guy would be gene ray also known as otis e ray he has a website known as time cube where he sets out his personal model of reality which he calls time cube he suggests that all of modern physics is wrong in addition to claiming that religion is evil specifically christianity and that the idea of family is poisoning children college scholarships to sexually active teens many people think adolescents should not engage in sexual activity let alone encouraged to do so by college scholarships this is the opposite of abstinence programs which encourage teens not to be sexually active until marriage illegal immigrants who create room for themselves by killing a citizen illegal immigration is a highly controversial topic in the united states one argument against illegal immigration is that illegal immigrants are taking jobs away from american citizens proponents of immigration assert that this is not the case since more people in the overall economy creates jobs and brings in more tax revenue neither group would be in favor of illegal immigrants murdering citizens even though it would not result in a net gain or loss in population graduated income tax based on penis size many men are sensitive about their penis size and would probably consider the measurement of their penises for tax assessment purposes an enormous embarrassment and invasion of privacy even the scenario in which those with relatively smaller penises would be levied less tax than those with larger penises would probably not be sufficient for them to accept this policy and even if they did those with larger penises would probably consider this policy to be unfair and the alternative a scenario in which larger penises pay less taxes would be both unfair and incredibly demeaning
