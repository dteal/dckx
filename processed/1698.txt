n this is a eisenhower box comparing how difficult it is to steal a specified thing with the severity of the theft it is very hard to steal nuclear launch codes they are protected by many layers of federal security that's a good thing too since if they were stolen they could be used to start a nuclear war it is also hard to steal the crown jewels since they are protected by a complex security system but if they were stolen it wouldn't be so bad for most people it wouldn't be too hard to steal the a wienermobile a car shaped like a hot dog advertising the oscar mayer brand there have been made several versions of this car and it would not be more difficult to steal than any other car although harder to hide  randall seems to consider that such a stolen vehicle would not be too bad although he has previously refereed to a stolen wienermobile in 935 missed connections which is driven recklessly almost hitting someone but it is not bad enough to consider it a big problem in a context when it is compared with stolen nuclear launch codes it also wouldn't be hard or at least not as hard as stealing nuclear launch codes or the crown jewels to steal the tinyurlcom domain name but the consequences of that could be significant and is thus listed under very bad the joke if of course that this is listed as just as bad as the risk of a nuclear war and of course it is not as significant but it could swiftly result in damage to a lot of important computers and ruin references in journals etc tinyurl offers a url shortening service they provide short urls that redirect to long ones this is useful if you want to write down a very long url as it saves typing and is more accurate other companies including bitlygoogle and twitter offer a similar service tinyurl was for a while the most popular of these url shortening services if their domain name were stolen all the redirects from short urls could be changed to forward traffic to sites hosting for example malware this would have significant effects on a large number of people because tinyurl is used in many places both online and as the title text notes even sometimes offline in the title text randall implies that stealing the tinyurlcom domain could happen when it next expires  a whois search as of june 2016 finds that the tinyurlcom domain is next due for renewal in june 2018  however rule changes made by icann the organization in charge of domain name registrations now make it effectively impossible to steal a domain name because the owner allowed its registration to lapse  current rules for com registrations now allow for the original owner to renew their domain name after it expires during a 0 45 day auto renew grace period  the exact length of this grace period depends on what company the domain is registered with  all registrars are then required to give a 30 day redemption grace period during which the domain may be renewed with penalty  as a result tinyurlcom would have a 30 75 day period after expiration during which the domain is not available for registration by a third party  icann rules state that dns resolution must be stopped during the redemption grace period which means that there will be a 30 day period during which tinyurlcom will no longer work but the company will have the ability to quickly restore ownership of their domain  it is very unlikely that any company that is still in business would not notice that their domain name has expired before the end of the 30 day redemption grace period another way to steal a domain name would be through domain name hijacking  there have been some high profile cases of domain name hijacking with one of the more notable domains being nikecom in 2000  however whether or not this is a risk for any particular domain name is difficult to estimate  additional security mechanisms such as domain name locking and private registrations have been introduced to mitigate the threat of domain name hijacking  further domain name hijacking relies on situation specific attacks such as hacking email accounts spoofing emails and social engineering attacks against either the company who owns the domain name or the company who registers the domain name  for security conscious companies such attacks can be impossible or at least an attacker's success may require security failures in more than one area  a summary of domain hijacking examples including an analysis of how they succeeded and what steps could have prevented them can be found here  in short though there is no way to say for sure how vulnerable any particular domain name might be to hijacking
