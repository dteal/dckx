n this is one of randall's my hobby comics the author makes semantically incorrect statements to frustrate pedantic people who know the correct word and confuse people who don't know the precise word so they can go on using the wrong word; see also 1429 data since randall is normally personified by cueball it makes most sense to call the one with the hobby cueball in the explanation below cueball's friend who also looks like cueball walks up to cueball and tells him that he has found a piece of a meteor cueball corrects him by telling him that what he found is called magma and that the phrase a piece of a meteor would be correct if the object was in the air once it hits the ground it is called magma in doing so he attempts to confuse or annoy his friend in truth meteorite is the expression for a piece of a meteoroid that has landed; meteor is the term for the streak of light caused by the meteoroid while it falls through the atmosphere thus the first statement by him is a partly true correction but the second one is wrong the word pedantic means being overly concerned with being precise it is usually a pejorative term used to refer to someone who is overly fussy and corrects someone's word choice even when the more ambiguous or slightly incorrect term they used was fine for informal communication one would tend to believe a pedant as they would usually know what they are pedantic about so when cueball is making wrong statements that seem pedantic he may make people believe him a volcano that would be the bane of such a pedantic person was depicted in the last panel of 1714 volcano types as a direct reference to this comic the title text expands on the joke as if the conversation had continued with a confused friend responding that he thought magma was underground cueball attempts to confuse him further by talking about lava which indeed is the expression for magma that has reached the surface but it's ridiculous to suggest that all other things are called lava when underground in the sentence he also continues to imply that magma could also be found above ground the two sentences thus follow the same pattern with one true but pedantic part to begin with and then a false statement to confuse the victim
