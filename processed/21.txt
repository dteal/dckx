n a cueball like guy asks cueball the store manager how they keep the store so clean and he is told that they have hired kepler a hard worker who doesn't mind the monotony and sweeps out the same area every night johannes kepler was a german mathematician astronomer and astrologer best known for his laws of planetary motion by using tycho brahe's observations of our solar system brahe gave kepler the job of observing and explaining the motion of the planet mars kepler was able to deduce that planets in the system do not move in a circular orbit around the sun but rather in an elliptical one according to kepler's second law a line joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time this looks like sweeping a broom over the floor in the comic the janitor kepler also sweeps the same area although in this case area is used in the sense of surface of floor rather than in the purely mathematical sense it is also very monotonous like a planet's set orbit but kepler doesn't mind this if it were not for the comic's publication in 2005 the comic could also very well be seen as a reference to the kepler space telescope that was looking for exoplanets planets outside the solar system from march 2009 to august 2013 looking at exactly the same spot of night sky over and over and over again
