n this comic shows a unix manual page ie a man page hence the title for a fictional program called blerp unix man pages are meant to provide a brief reference on the usage of a command not extended explanations with tutorials as may be found in many hardcopy product manuals unfortunately some unix commands tend to be very bloated and include lots of optional behavior that is often irrelevant to the original intent of the command and can be done much more easily using shell features like piping and redirection and thus the manpage grows to explain all of the features this example exaggerates the obscurity and terseness found in many man pages making fun of the typical style of the genre it follows the prescribed format for a man page with the following sections  command name self explanatory synopsis a synopsis of the valid command line formats description a summary of the purpose and operation of the command options detailed description of all the available command line arguments see also references to other man pages with relevance bug reports contact details for the support group if any copyright details of the ownership and rights status of the man page not the program  for comic effect most of this particular man page is not meaningful and sometimes doesn't obey the expected syntax the synopsis section is supposed to be in a regex like language called wirth syntax notation with structures like  &lt;list of valid alternatives&gt; eg blerp abc &lt;optional element&gt; eg blerpo &lt;output file&gt; &lt;something&gt; meaning repeat &lt;something&gt; as many times as you need  but the two synopsis lines given do not have valid wirth syntax; they randomly mix objects and syntactic characters and the brackets and braces are not properly nested or paired the description section provides an unhelpful summary that could apply to almost any unix command processing input files or output of other commands in a pipeline is a generic function for unix shell tools as is specifying their behaviour with command line arguments environment variables and flags the text leaves to the reader's imagination what the program actually does and what behavior the various options modify which gives maximum scope for humorous possibilities the options are in conventional alphabetical order except that lower case is placed before upper case and an em dash is inserted between b and c command line options also known as flags are typed after the program's name to change how the program runs for example a user of blerp might type blerpadtp avignon according to the man page this would run blerp in attack mode piping its output to debugexe with tumble dry and the true pope set to avignon in most cases any number of flags can be used in any order and flags can be followed by argument such as avignon in this example for a walkthrough of all possible flags see the table of flags below below the flags there is a see also list with other ludicrous program names apart from two more versions of blerb there is also blirb blarb and blorp with chapter references the last blorp501c3 is not a valid chapter reference for a man page it is however a slightly covert reference to 501c3 which is an organization that is tax exempt then follows a bug report site wwwinaturalistorg is a site working to extend biological research and the exact address given http//wwwinaturalistorg/taxa/47744 hemiptera points to the same page as http//wwwinaturalistorg/taxa/hemiptera hemiptera is the order classifying true bugs making it a good place to report any biological bugs discovered while running a program insects got into some early computers causing them to malfunction and hence computer malfunctions are often called bugs finally there is a copyright line which references several variously open source content licenses which is a recurring theme on xkcd see 225 open source for instance gpl references gnu general public license and the 2 and 3+ refers to gpl 2 and gpl 3 or higher cc refers to creative commons where by is the type of license 50 refers to the attribution and rv 410 refers to revision 410 however there were no higher attribution than 40 at the time of this comic's release xkcd is released under cc by nc 25 as can be seen at the bottom of the xkcd &#160;&#160;homepage a few comics have been released under the cc by sa license or 30 bsd refers to bsd licenses another recurring theme in xkcd like gecko is a reference to a web browser user agent string; modern user agent strings include a lot of text designed to allow browsers to masquerade as different browsers/renderers and like gecko is the standard text for a browser that wants to be treated as if it were gecko while admitting if you look closely that it isn't really gecko this copyright line which includes a lot of mashed together text that might appear to match any of several different licenses resembles a user agent string or best offer is usually seen on a notice of a private sale where it proclaims the intent to be flexible on asking price in the hope of expediting the sale with a suggestion that the seller will sell to the highest bidder even if the offer is nowhere near the asking price in the context of the comic it suggest that the rights for the program are available for purchase by anyone who makes the best offer since the other licenses listed would allow free usage without incurring any royalty charge it would be pointless to buy the rights to this program it is possible to revoke the other licenses though perhaps the program's creator is suggesting the rights could be given to someone making him a different sort of offer perhaps romantic or sexual in the title text there is a list with even more info again with silly names like blarbl and birb again there are page references while writing about birb and without bothering to close the brackets around 3 the writer breaks off to laugh at the reader telling them that he is kidding and suggesting that they just google it like a normal person the implication is that anyone trying to pick through a man page to find out what a program does is going the long way round when it's much simpler to get google to tell you man pages were part of the subject of 293 rtfm 912 manual override and 1343 manuals and were mentioned in 434 xkcd goes to the airport and 456 cautionary
