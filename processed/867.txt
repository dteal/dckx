n herpetology is the branch of zoology that studies reptiles and amphibians ornithology is the branch of zoology that studies birds at an ornithology conference ponytail is using the cladistics method by showing a cladogram to argue that the combining of amphibians and reptiles into a single field of study is  misguided  in terms of their evolutionary history reptiles are more closely related to birds and even to mammals than to amphibians  she states in a patronizing way that the study of reptiles should more properly be combined into her own field herpetologists would rightly see this view as a threat to their territory their budgets and even their existence the claim made by the ornithologist is fundamentally correct; the evolutionary history of those groups did actually diverge in that way so instead of arguing the science megan the presenter at the herpetology conference resort to a personal attack on the profession of ornithology  at their own conference they retaliate with a chart that purports to demonstrate that douchebags and ornithologists are more closely related to each other than either are to nice people and they can therefore be grouped into an encompassing asshole classification since the intent of the earlier presentation was presumably to rile herpetologists rather than achieve any particular scientific goal this response seems appropriate in the title text birds are class aves which is a subset of the suborder theropoda which is a subset of the order saurischia and the superorder dinosauria under the normal rules of classification this means that all birds are technically dinosaurs this was also shown in more detail later in 1211 birds and dinosaurs
