n smartwatches are fairly recent innovations which function something like smartphones which are attached to one's wrist although the screens are often shorter than those of typical smartphones and they typically need to be attached via bluetooth to a smartphone this comic shows someone case modding some smartwatches and a broken smartphone; that is taking the electronic innards of two smartwatches and putting them into the sawn in half case of a smartphone before attaching the two halves with a hinge allowing it to open and close like flip phones a type that was popular before the rise of smartphones the western electric model 2500 is the last standard desk style domestic telephone set issued by the bell system in north america it contains the # key and the * key so it can be said it has same application features as the first cellphones but it's obviously much bigger and of course not wireless smartphones usually have much more functionality case modding is the art of building machines usually computers into nicely shaped non standard cases the opinion about niceness of the result vary as usual in art the point is that changing the case doesn't change the functionality so the niceness or usually coolness is generally the only relevant feature although badly done modding can affect cooling it appears that randall has a rather low opinion of smartwatches as he suggests that it would be better to take out their screens and mount them onto a dead iphone than to use them the way smartwatches are normally used however randall's suggestion to cut open the dead phone with a hacksaw is unsound for several reasons 1 any attempt to saw through glass will cause it to shatter to cut glass one needs to grind it not saw it 2 even if the phone is dead the battery may be charged saw blades conduct electricity so the person might get electrocuted 3 some batteries contain chemicals that are toxic or explosive  even if the battery is discharged sawing through it is very dangerous to add which the hinge depicted in the cartoon is an ordinary household hinge it is overly large for using in electronics compared to hinges on old clamshell style cell phones and drilling holes in the watch cases to attach one would potentially damage the internal electronic circuits rendering the watch useless 4 also it's possible the watches wouldn't fit that nicely into the iphone
