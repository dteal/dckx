n an advent calendar is a special calendar used to count or celebrate the days in anticipation of christmas they come in a multitude of forms from a simple paper calendar with flaps covering each of the days to fabric pockets on a background scene to painted wooden boxes with cubby holes for small items advent calendars typically take the form of a large rectangular card with windows of which there are usually 24 one for each day of december leading up to and including christmas eve december 24 consecutive doors are opened every day leading up to christmas beginning on december 1 the calendar windows open to reveal an image a poem a portion of a story such as the story of the nativity of jesus or a small gift such as a toy or a chocolate item this comic however depicts an advent calendar which has a chocolate every time they get halfway to christmas this is a joke because of zeno's paradox which said before a moving object can travel a certain distance it must travel half that distance before it can travel half the distance it must travel 1/4 the distance etc this sequence goes on forever therefore it seems that the original distance cannot be traveled and motion is impossible this means that eating chocolates at diminishing intervals will make it so christmas never happens the title text says that when you get close to midnight it gets physically impossible to eat the chocolates that fast but you could get the one second away mark with a chocolate liquefier and feeder tube going from the second to the last of the visible time stamps it goes like this at 11571125 pm there is still remaining 00024875 2 minutes 48 seconds and 75 hundredth of a second half of this time period will then progress before the next windows time stamp that is 000124375 1 minute and 24375 s this will then give the next time stamp by adding to the previous and we get 115835625 pm this has been rounded to 3563 s in the comic similarly the time stamp for the next four windows whose top are visible below can be calculated starting from the fact that there is now only 000124375 left of the day  13 421875 s left so the time stamp is 1159178125 14 2109375 s left so the time stamp is 11593990625 15 10546875 s left so the time stamp is 115949453125 16 52734375 s left so the time stamp is 1159547265625  it would take three more windows before crossing the 115959 line with less than one second to go at the 19th window there would only be 06591796875 seconds left of the day for a time stamp of 1159593408203125 so that would be a window another line further down even below the green window no 15 that is just visible at the button of the panel and you would have to eat four chocolates in less than five seconds from window no 16 to fulfill randall's prediction when reaching the 24th window there would be 00206 s left so that is 6 chocolates in 0638 s that may be a good place to stop but of course you could continue at least until reaching the planck time of 539 x 10 44 s that limit will not be reached before window 162 so there are still 138 chocolates left for those last two hundredths of a second 1153 proof is also about zeno and 1577 advent is a very different longer running advent calendar but with only a finite number of windows
