his work on relativity was still not accepted by many physicists at that time  1912 6 titanic survivors who should have died  sinking of the rms titanic should have died seems to be referring to six passengers whose survival was downright miraculous though the wording is deliberately ambiguous to imply the six passengers deserved to have died possibly referred to here is the survival of j bruce ismay chairman and managing director of the white star line the company responsible for the titanic who was condemned as a coward for leaving the sinking liner  1920 17 things that will be outlawed now that women can vote  the nineteenth amendment to the united states constitution was passed guaranteeing voting rights for women in all us states the prediction of new prohibitions is a reference to alcohol prohibition under the authority granted to the federal government by the eighteenth amendment to the united states constitution while the eighteenth amendment was ratified before women's suffrage was guaranteed by the nineteeth alcohol prohibition was widely seen as an issue driven by women's opinions hence the suggestion that more things would be prohibited now that women had the vote  1928 this one weird mold kills all germs  penicillin was discovered  1929 most embarrassing reactions to the stock market crash gifs  this is a reference to the wall street crash of 1929 the most devastating stock market crash in history and the beginning of the great depression the embarassing reactions may be a reference to the suicides of people suddenly impoverished by the depression gifs indicates that the post will contain animated gif images which are a crude form of short video presumably these gifs will feature the aforementioned suicides which would be considered tasteless at best  1945 these 9 nazi atrocities will make you lose faith in humanity  1945 is the year that world war ii ended it's also the year that many war crimes committed by nazi germany were discovered or declassified these events would be cause enough for anyone to re evaluate their belief in the inherent goodness of the human race however the specific phrase lose faith in humanity is one often employed on the web by rather over dramatic people in response to something someone did to exasperate them; and because that particular wording is closely associated with exaggerative tendencies its usage in relation to nazi war crimes only downplays their seriousness  1948 5 insane plans for feeding west berlin you won't believe are real  1948 is when the soviet union established the berlin blockade preventing food and other critical supplies from reaching occupied berlin in response western forces organized the berlin airlift  1955 avoid polio with this one weird trick  the polio vaccine was developed one weird trick is a common phrase used in internet ads see this article for more information it may also refer to the fact that polio viruses were used as the first vaccines  1957 12 nip slips potentially visible to sputnik  the soviet union launched sputnik 1 the world's first artificial satellite a nip slip is when a woman unintentionally exposes all or part of one or both of her nipples;

only cnn broadcast it live since this many children did see it there would also have been several terminal ill children watching and likely also some press out at one such place so they could get this picture and again toy with out emotions  1989 you won't believe what these people did to the berlin wall video  fall of the berlin wall video indicates a link to a video  jan 1 1990 500 signs you're a 90s kid  a 90s kid is someone born in the late 80s or early 90s and spent most their childhood in the 1990s headlines like this one from buzzfeed toy with their readers' sense of nostalgia the parody headline is funny because it starts precisely on the first day of the 1990s meaning that the only 90s kids that it would apply to would be newborns this is a reference to a common joke about the 90s not having a concrete identity in some ways like the 70s or 80s did in terms of popular culture and yet those born in that decade always seem to have long lists of things that make you a 90s kid  the title text 1916 'physicist dad' turns his attention to gravity and you won't believe what he finds pics nsfw  einstein published his theory of general relativity which is a vast generalization of the theory of special relativity from 1905 and provides a model for gravity in 1916 einstein had two sons who lived in zurich while he lived in berlin nsfw is not safe for work a tag to identify explicit images here it is used to trick readers hoping to find pornography pics tells the potential viewer that there are images embedded if you think of gravity as a girls name then the references to porn becomes more obvious  this topic is re used in 1307 buzzfeed christmas
