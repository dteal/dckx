n the comic talks about regular expressions which are a way to specify textual patterns given a regular expression one can search for the pattern it specifies inside a text string if the pattern is found it's said that the pattern matches the string; if it's not found it's said it doesn't match the title of the comic and the first panel is based on regex golf which is a discipline of code golf a game in which programmers attempt to solve a given programming problem using as few characters as possible analogous to the number of golf shots it takes to reach the goal in regex golfing the programmer is given two sets of text fragments and he/she tries to write the shortest possible regular expression which would match all elements of one set while at the same time not matching any element from the other set the regex golf challenge megan faces consists of matching all subtitles of then extant star wars films while not matching any subtitle of star trek movies subtitles are the secondary titles of the movies after the star trek  or star wars episode n  for example in star wars episode i the phantom menace the subtitle is the phantom menace in the first panel she created a 12 character regex solving the challenge then she moved on to building a tool which would automatically build such a regex for arbitrary lists of text which could be described as meta  regex golfing but as she has lost this tool she needs to search through her files and chooses a tool called grep to find it this implies that she needs a regular expression that would find any code that appears to be a regex golf generator which leads to another meta  layer of abstraction at the end megan notes this sequence of meta meta  might go to infinity and cueball quips that she now has infinite problems as a result of her efforts; megan retorts that she already had infinite problems because she's geeky enough to run meta versions of programs on themselves and stubborn enough to continue on until she fails to the exclusion of all else this also seems to be a reference to a famous quote see also 1171 perl problems  some people when confronted with a problem think i know i'll use regular expressions now they have two problems
