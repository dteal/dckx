n cueball is a news anchor describing the gateway arch as one of the most recognizable arches in st louis when describing things reporters try to make only factual statements if reporters use absolutes that something is the largest or the smallest thing of its class or that it is unprecedented to give several examples they risk making errors it is possible that some other example of the thing exists that is even larger or even smaller or that there was some similar incident in the past and they were not aware of it if a reader or viewer points out the existence of that thing even if obscure or trivial the reporter must issue a correction as a result reporters learn to hedge by using formulations such as one of the biggest or a rare example of randall states that it is his pet peeve when reporters avoid absolutes unnecessarily xe2x80x94 that is in cases where there's vanishingly little risk of error as an absurd example randall depicts one such reporter using this language about the gateway arch as the most well known monument in missouri and the largest free standing arch in the world it's indisputable that this would be the most recognizable arch in st louis in the title text randall jokes about what could happen if you misunderstand the practice of avoiding absolutes; he thus appears to think it is an ostentatious display of faux objectivity as opposed to a correction avoiding strategy the title text refers to novelty mugs and t shirts and other printed items that use superlative descriptions such as world's greatest mom or world's greatest dad obviously such a statement is an expression of personal affection on the part of the family member who gave such a gift and is not meant to be understood as a literally true fact about the world using a parody of reporter speak like giving a mug to your mother that says one of the world's greatest moms would ruin the compliment by suggesting to her that you thought some other people's moms were as good or better the title text also refers to mother's day which in the us was three days before this comic was published
