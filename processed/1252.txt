n the panel satirises the common misunderstanding of the concept of percentage quoting a percentage change without mentioning the base probability that this ratio acts on is meaningless outside of arithmetic for arithmetic's sake most everyday communication however succumbs to such incompleteness in the aftermath of this ambiguity people tend to conflate relative and absolute changes if the probability of a shark attack at the north beach is 5 per million then the probability of shark attack at the south beach is still not more than 6 per million the difference between these values is not enough to normally justify choosing one beach over the other even though a 20% greater chance sounds significant when stated out of this larger context cueball parodies the concern by noting that by going to a beach three times instead of two their chances of attack by dogs with handguns in their mouths a ludicrous and unrealistic scenario as dogs cannot buy guns and are not likely to pick one up off the ground increases by 50% if the chance of the dog attack is one per billion on each visit to the beach then the chance of attack increases over multiple visits regardless; it's still one in a billion for any specific visit this does not change the overall improbability of there ever being a dog swimming with a gun in its mouth beret guy misunderstands cueball's probability exhibiting the gambler's fallacy by believing that since they haven't been attacked in their first two trips the chance of attack by dogs with handguns is higher on their third outing this is a common misunderstanding of statistics while the overall probability of an attack in three trips would be higher than in a single trip it doesn't change the fact that in each individual trip the probability is still the same; whether or not they managed to avoid being attacked in their first two trips the results of these trips do not factor into the probability equation of the third trip this also can be illustrated by coin flips if one flips a coin ten times in a row no matter what the result of each previous flip is even if it were nine heads in a row the odds of getting heads on the tenth coin flip remains 50% in other words past experience does not impact subsequent flips the caption clarifies cueball's point but without sarcasm then again the title text objects to this point that a tiny risk increased by 50% is still tiny if this 50% increment is done repeatedly the risk can get arbitrarily high while the statement says that it is still tiny this can be compared to the sorites paradox the paradox of the heap which involves a heap of sand from which grains of sand are removed individually if one assumes that after removing a single grain a heap of sand is still considered a heap of sand and that there are a limited number of grains of sand in the heap then one is forced to accept the conclusion that it can still be considered a heap of sand even if there is only a single grain of sand or even none at all
