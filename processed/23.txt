n this comic satirizes the plethora of snarky phrase t shirts that exist today in the top left the character wears a typical and real snark shirt i see dumb people suggesting the wearer thinks everyone else is dumb while being a parody of the phrase i see dead people from the movie the sixth sense other shirts shown also suggest the wearer is better than everyone else and perhaps the shirts increasingly suggest the wearer is anti social moving from top to bottom near the bottom of the screen the t shirts no longer attempt to be witty and simply have straightforward phrases like go away and die these are exaggerations of the message that the other more realistic shirts broadcast the final three shirts are also exaggerated shirts that suggest randall's view that people who wear snarky shirts are overcompensating for the fact that they are already alone or perhaps putting up a tough exterior to conceal their sadness that no one would talk to them anyway most notably maybe if this t shirt is witty enough someone will finally love me sums up what randall thinks snarky shirts really say there are shirts with this or a similar message; although it is unclear whether they were created before this comic or as a tribute to this comic
