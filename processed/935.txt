n missed connections is a page on craigslist in which people who saw each other briefly and want to reconnect attempt to find each other again in the case of missed connections one person describes themselves me and describes the other person you in order that the second person would recognize themself and try to reconnect the first entry appears to be a goofy joke although there have been many wienermobile incidents in the past given the timing of this comic one can't help but wonder if it might also be a pun referencing the then recent resignation of rep anthony weiner over tweeting pictures of his well wiener with his mobile device the second entry refers to a person you looking down into a wishing well presumably to throw in a coin to get a wish but someone me is sitting down in the well with a harpoon looking up spotting the silhouette at the top of the well this seems like a very weird thing to do and the vaguely human shadow may be lucky to be alive since the only reason the you should know about the me is if the me fired the harpoon and missed a person sitting in a well telling people stuff as if it was the well speaking was the pun in 568 well 2 oddly enough this entry could possibly be a reference to this episode of the fairly oddparents the third entry is a reference to networking udp stands for user datagram protocol udp packets don't use handshaking to verify they have contacted the correct host so they can get lost or confused the cisco router location is a block of ip addresses that was unallocated at the time when this comic was published but has been allocated to latin america and caribbean since then cisco is a company that makes networking equipment this is a play on a missed connection for someone who was lost and asked for directions the fourth entry is a reference to two events in 2011 in which president barack obama invited rappers  among other people  to the white house after each event right wing commentators blasted the event as a party unbecoming of the dignity of the white house nancy pelosi is the democratic leader of the us house of representatives the acronym d ca is a common notation for politicians which notates party d for democrat and state ca for california pelosi would have also been invited to these events and the missed connections listing is a reference to what the commentators imagined the event would have been like a juggalo is a term referring to a fan of the rap group insane clown posse which includes rapper violent j which is notorious for having wild misogynistic and violent fanbase the fifth entry is a straightforward joke one of the two people getting married was so distracted by their phone they have no clue where their spouse is now or even who they are alternatively it could be that the second party deserted the wedding because they were frustrated by their partner being distracted by their cell phone during the wedding and the first partner is now hoping to convince them to return the sixth entry is a reference to how the google street view car was not only recording photos of the street in 360 degrees it was also collecting data from unencrypted wi fi networks the comic takes this to the next level that the google street view van also scans what we have in our pockets and does a retinal scan in this case the social security number referenced is the most used ssn of all time the retinal scan takes this even further indicating that google's cameras are collecting fine enough images to identify people by retinal scan the last entry suggests that babe ruth the american baseball slugger of 1914 1935 is actually a time lord time lord is a reference to the popular sci fi series doctor who in which the doctor who is a time lord uses a tardis which is a time travel machine possibly because he was a baseball player ahead of his time the title text is another reference to the privacy concerns surrounding google street view van to which google responded by claiming that the street view camera wouldn't capture anything that someone walking by wouldn't be able to see randall is not worried about the street view van since he expects that google will already now anything that such a van could discover from reading his e mails this last statement is of course much more serious that having a photo taken by a passing van thus making it clear what people should fuss about and it is not the van
