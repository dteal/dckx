n a common tool for explaining concepts in elementary probability theory are games involving the drawing of coloured balls from a container such as a bag or hat in older statistics related texts a convention developed of describing the container as an urn this is so common that such problems are often called urn problems while an urn can have many uses in modern times the most common context in which it is used is to contain the burned remains of deceased individuals after a cremation this is likely because as interior decor has grown more minimalist other types of urn became less common and the association of the word urn with cremation has become ubiquitous in the vernacular megan when asked to imagine drawing balls from an urn imagines a cremation urn containing not only balls but also human remains she may be referring to a real grandfather who has been cremated or is simply improvising a joke at cueball's expense the title text refers to two distinct scenarios in the coloured ball experiment the balls may be replaced between each drawing or not in the former case each draw is independent of the previous in the latter the chances of picking a particular remaining ball the next time have increased megan or rather randall if it is he who speaks in the title text would prefer to put the ashes back into the urn she might also want to have her grandfather back and be playing with the word replacement the distinction between repeated drawing with and without replacement is used in most presentations of elementary probability because it illustrates a subtle but important theoretical distinction if the balls are replaced one at a time before drawing the next the number of balls of a certain colour has the binomial distribution but if the balls are not replaced so that the same ball cannot be drawn twice you instead get the hypergeometric distribution in the context of this comic drawing with replacement would mean that the dead grandfather's ashes have been magically replaced as soon as megan removed them from the urn thus her grandfather's ashes would still remain intact &amp; sacrosanct inside the urn hence the commentary pleading for it to be drawing with replacement of course such an event actually happening in real life is nonsensical further illustrating the contrived nature of many academic problems
