n ldxe2x82x85xe2x82x80 is a term used in toxicology that identifies the median lethal dose of a toxin or how much is required to kill 50% of a given population ldxe2x82x85xe2x82x80s are usually measured in g/kg as the amount of toxin to kill something is usually linearly related with its mass the lower the ldxe2x82x85xe2x82x80 the more lethal the toxin an ldxe2x82x85xe2x82x80 can be determined for almost any substance for example the ldxe2x82x85xe2x82x80 for sugar in rats is 297&#160;g/kg however botulinum toxin commercially known as botox in the beauty industry the most acutely toxic substance known has a ldxe2x82x85xe2x82x80 of roughly 1&#160;ng/kg or 0000000001&#160;g/kg a vanishingly small amount the comic is making the joke that the ldxe2x82x85xe2x82x80 of papers on toxicology is 2&#160;kg/kg so it takes 2 kilograms of papers on toxicology to kill a person for each kg he/she weighs the worldwide average weight of an adult is 62&#160;kg 137&#160;lb so the lethal dose would be 124&#160;kg 273&#160;pounds of toxicology papers death is apparently caused by compression or smothering the title text says it will take less paper to kill a person if the paper is shoved down their throat instead of dropped on them either by suffocation or by bursting the subject's stomach a third method of delivering a toxin is by subcutaneous injections which are highly effective in administering vaccines and medications but that number is omitted since they couldn't figure out how to do it if they could the amount of paper required to trigger a fatal blood vessel blockage would probably be fairly small
