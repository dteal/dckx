n cueball wants to say ri fucking diculous but he inserts the fucking too late in the word now he has to say ridicu fucking lous which sounds ri fucking diculous this is an example of tmesis the breaking up of a word to include another within it and more specifically of expletive infixation normally for rhythmic reasons the included word is inserted before the stressed syllable ridiculous becoming ri fucking diculous which is what cueball messed up however in some cases it is also possible to break the word after a prefix instead so for some words there are two ways to do it eg unbe fucking lievable before the stressed syllable or un fucking believable; this is because unbelievable is a combination of un and believable to negate believable which is an actual english word and therefore it still sounds good the title text introduces a further example with speaker inserting the fucking too late into the word absolutelyxe2x80x94which would have resulted in absolute fucking lyxe2x80x94but leaving the word unfinished when they realize their mistake the more usual tmesis here would be abso fucking lutely
