n both on the internet and in the physical world people with unpopular or poorly thought out opinions may complain that their freedom of speech is being restricted because others express their distaste for those opinions as a defense these individuals may invoke the first amendment to the united states constitution which provides among other things for freedom of speech for any entity or person under legal jurisdiction of the us more specifically it states that congress shall make no law  abridging the freedom of speech or of the press originally intended as a restriction on the powers of us federal government which the constitution defines structures and delimits over time the first amendment as well as several others were incorporated via the fourteenth amendment to apply to state and local governments as well this protection of free speech however does not extend to illegal activities for example the concept of a clear and present danger and it does not compel others to listen to or acknowledge the speech the intended targets of the speech may simply choose to stop listening or to speak louder in protest an example of this is the incident involving the tv program duck dynasty in december 2013 in which television network a+e networks suspended the host after he made homophobic remarks causing some to comment that his rights had been infringed upon similarly in april 2014 controversy erupted when brendan eich was forced to resign as ceo of mozilla because it was revealed he had donated money to anti gay marriage efforts in california in actuality the first amendment was never meant to provide immunity from any and all consequences cueball is addressing anyone who has used this argument as the comic says just because you're legally allowed to say something doesn't mean that everyone is legally required to listen it also does not mean that a commercial or social entity xe2x80x94 such as a tv network a website or its community xe2x80x94 is legally required to support you in spreading your message even if it had supported you in the past if someone says something which others find stupid or offensive he or she should be ready to accept the consequences of others responses regardless of who is right or whose idea is more popular the title text points out the irony of anyone appealing to free speech as a defense for their argument or opinion if the only thing that someone can say in support of an argument is effectively that it is not illegal then they are severely undermining it by essentially admitting that they don't have any better defense for it
