n megan in one of the few comics where she is actually named and ponytail are playing together on an online multiplayer shooter game ponytail calls cueball who is living with megan and easily persuades him to make nachos wi fi and microwave ovens both use radio frequencies around 24 ghz so cueball's cooking disrupts megan's connection and allows ponytail to kill megan's character boom headshot is a catchphrase made popular through a web mockumentary series called pure pwnage and is also used in the game league of legends by the character nidalee the title text points out that megan has only herself to blame as gaming on wifi is susceptible to such issues while gaming with a wired connection eg ethernet is not note if using the microwave actually does interfere with your wifi then get another microwave not strictly because it would mess with the wifi but because your microwave has a hole somewhere and is leaking non ionizing radiation it shouldn't it won't kill you but it's not operating at peak efficiency see this video on the subject around the time of this comic's release the xkcd website was temporarily redesigned using yahoo geocities snapshots of the site at the time can be found on the internet archive wayback machine
