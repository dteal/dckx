n a podium is a small platform like the one cueball is standing on this word originates from greek podion meaning foot a lectern is a stand for holding notes like the one cueball standing behind in american english this stand may be also called a podium which is not backed up by etymology see podium and lectern in oxford learners dictionaries in medieval universities the lecturer was not someone who gave talks but literally one who read from the lectern the latin root meaning to read lectio the comic is playing on a stereotypical politician without any real beliefs here represented by cueball but they want to appear to stand for something  alternatively this is what might happen if someone like cueball or the strip's author randall who tend to think literally and who get interested in and distracted by tangents were running thus cueball picks up what is in some american circles an argument whether the standing desk used by public speakers should be called a podium or a lectern this argument is actually common among members of toastmasters international see more here though it would usually not rise to the level of needing to be part of a national discourse and it is not only the toastmasters that care about this the fact is though the etymological definition is clear the lectern is the desk that stands on the podium and the difference might be important if you were setting up an auditorium in common american usage it really doesn't matter the title text is presented as a breaking news that implies that a senator has taken a bold stand on the subject of podium vs lectern this senator could be cueball but it could also be another who has been rallied by cueball's speech the senator is pro  podium meaning that he thinks the lectern should be called a podium  this leads to the people who follow a prescriptivist position to organize and put forward a political candidate to challenge this senator in the primaries the prescriptivist position relies on rules rather than on usage in this case a prescriptivist relies on etymology and would thus be pro lectern in the us the primaries are used to select a single candidate from a particular party to represent that party at final election whether national or on a state level at the time of this comics release 2016 03 28 the united states presidential primary elections to determine the candidates for the united states presidential election 2016 was in full progress and not at all determined yet the title text is also a pun as 'stand' is another word for an object like a lectern eg as used by musicians to hold sheet music and 'base' a word for something a stand or lectern might be placed on as is a podium it is unclear from this comic which position randall favors he likes that rules are followed but he also like that it is easy to talk with people especially friends this was recently displayed in 1643 degrees see especially the last benefits in the third panel
