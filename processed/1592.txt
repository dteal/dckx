n in this comic cueball is telling white hat about several recent scientific studies he read that appear to contradict the results of either prior studies whose results have stood for a long time or at least long held misconceptions the studies can be reviewed on line via their digital object identifier doi in randall's citations in the first cueball mentions a study that showed that while water is good for you you only need to drink when you are thirsty this appears to be a reference to common misconceptions that we should drink a certain set quantity of water per day oft cited as eight cups see 715 numbers and may even be referencing the fact that drinking too much water well more than the standard 8 cups for most people can lead to hyponatremia lack of salt in the body another recent study showed that prolonged sitting is not bad for you which contradicts the long held belief that sitting at a desk all day is unhealthy and that standing or lying down are healthier the study showed that the position is not particularly relevant if there is no physical activity in any of the positions finally cueball references a study that pre industrial humans have similar sleep patterns to our own which would appear to contradict a belief that modern technology has disrupted our sleep patterns which is likely tied to health concerns around our modern sleep habits cueball's conclusion is that humanity may be over thinking things in trying to find problems in the way we live our everyday lives in the last panel white hat seems to be attempting to start an inquiry into what everyday modern phenomenon has caused us to over think things this is obviously a self referencing example of the types of claims cueball is debunking in the first three panels cueball responds by suggesting that humanity's over thinking is likely not a recent phenomenon but probably dates back to the stone age this could also be viewed as an argument that over thinking is not all bad the wheel would certainly be a good result of over thinking in the title text cueball gives a counter example to his own argument suggesting that it took far longer for us to realize the negative health connotations of smoking than it should have suggesting instead it's not about overthinking or underthinking it's just that people make mistakes and we don't know everything that said the link between cigarettes and lung cancer has been known for longer than most people realize possibly coming as early as the 1940s
