n this comic is basically about a terrible person that cueball is somehow talking to possibly at a bar or party as goatee guy is carrying a drink the title of this comic is a play on the phrase stranger than fiction which means that sometimes real life can lead to some unexpected ups and downs that would not even make sense in a fictional representation in a book or a movie goatee guy's life unfortunately for him is sloppier than fiction in the title text roger ebert was a famous american movie critic oh and fyi if anyone ever says it wasn't technically cheating it was cheating
