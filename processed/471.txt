n here we see cueball and his cueball like friend who are grossed out that there is a furry noted by the kid's fox ears and tail near them these people most likely have bought into the stereotype of furries and as such are showing their disgust towards what they perceive the fandom to wrongly be megan then calls for the furry to help her with her kite the way this turns out she also thinks that furries are weird as hell but she is also irritated by the fact that a lot of people on the internet are involved with a lot of weird things that may gross out or otherwise offend the general population yet the internet in general frequently mocks furries for engaging in essentially the same things this hypocrisy bothers her so she takes whatever opportunity she has to defend furries who are after all people of the internet hearing this the furry brings up the fable of the lion and the mouse from aesop this fable talks about a lion who spares a mouse from being eaten since the mouse's promise that he would repay the lion gave the lion a good laugh in the story the lion later gets caught in a trap and the mouse chews through the cords freeing the lion the furry now has a debt to repay megan but before we can get to that megan curtails the simile she assumes that the furry will perceive the story to be about animal bondage relationships and be aroused by such although it should be noted that this will very likely not arouse the furry  in the title text megan realizes that her kite needs a passenger so she asks the furry if he has any hamster friends being a furry this could be either real hamsters which could be tied to the kite or people with hamster fursonas who would probably be too large to be tied to the kite and remain buoyant this may be a reference to 20 ferret
