n in this fourth my hobby strip the hobby is mixing curse levels curse words aka swear words/profanities are disrespectful words that are typically impolite to use in public as noted in the strip there are levels of curse words ranging from those mild words which are more acceptable to use to those severe words which are considered very impolite the milder curse words can be used on network television in the us for example while severe ones can not one usually uses milder cursing because either they personally don't feel comfortable using the more severe words or because it would not be appropriate in the context such as on network television in the presence of children etc thus mixing mild and severe curses in one usage does not usually occur as the effect achieved by keeping the one curse word mild is negated by using another which is severe in a mild curse gosh darned is typically used as a mild version of god damned when the latter would be inappropriate this is mixed with cunt xe2x80x94 a vulgar term for the female genitalia which is one of the most severe curse words
