n the early comics often feature a style different to what would become the signature xkcd stick figure style this comic is the first in an arc of comics spaced out over 3 years so far in which red spiders are seen attacking humans its objective is not to be funny philosophical or scientifically interesting; it just tells a story in a questionable content type way the full series of red spiders  8 red spiders this one 43 red spiders 2 in which the spiders begin building 47 counter red spiders in which the humans begin a counter offensive 126 red spiders cometh in which the spiders attack a city 427 bad timing in which in a style more typical to xkcd the spiders attack a couple in the middle of a serious relationship discussion in a hot air balloon 442 xkcd loves the discovery channel in which it appears briefly in the 14th panel crawling over a cube
