n cueball appears to be asking ponytail to write an app that determines if a given picture is 1 taken in a national park and 2 a picture of a bird the first question is generally harder for a human to answer but easy for an app that has access to location information and a geographic information system gis the second one is easy for a human but much harder for a computer this illustrates moravec's paradox from the 1980s in a modern context by the 1950s computers were useful for tasks like trajectory optimization generating novel mathematical proofs and the game of checkers so such high level computation and reasoning tasks that were hard for humans turned out to be relatively easy for them on the other hand it turns out to be hard to give them the skills of a one year old when it comes to perception as moravec wrote in order to determine whether the user is in a national park ponytail plans to determine the user's location using the mobile device this location will then be cross checked with a geographic information system gis which will be able to determine whether the coordinates lie within a national park boundary determining whether an image is of a given kind of natural object is far more difficult this task falls into the area of computer vision one of the goals in computer vision is to detect and classify objects within an image this is a very challenging task for a number of reasons  firstly humans use size edge assignment movement and stereoscopic vision when looking at a scene not a picture of a thing but of the thing itself to discern individual objects and then categorize them as foreground or background1 a photograph however is a static monoscopic image that can only provide size and edge assignment clues humans are only able to discern objects from background in photographs by comparing the photo against all of the things they've seen and everything they've learned about those things over the course of their life and identifying matching patterns2   secondly the quality of the photograph will have an impact on a computer's ability to match patterns for example the object in the photograph might be partially visible or occluded in the case of a living bird additional complications arise from the variations among individual birds of the same species and differences in pose flying perching in a tree etc differentiating between visually similar objects can result in false positives for example is it a photo of a bird in flight or a plane or superman ponytail's estimate of 5 years may be overly optimistic see 678 researcher translation  today's state of the art algorithms for solving this kind of task mostly use local features eg sift or surf in combination with a support vector machine or convolutional neural network the subtitle refers to cs which is a common acronym for computer science of which artificial intelligence and computer vision are sub disciplines the title text mentions the summer vision project and marvin minsky of mit in the summer of 1966 he asked his undergraduate student gerald jay sussman to spend the summer linking a camera to a computer and getting the computer to describe what it saw 1 seymour papert drafted the plan and it seems that sussman was joined by bill gosper richard greenblatt leslie lamport adolfo guzman michael speciner john white benjamin and henneman the project schedule allocated one summer for the completion of this task the required time was obviously significantly underestimated since dozens of research groups around the world are still working on this topic today a month after this comic came out flickr responded with a prototype online tool to do something similar to what comic describes using its automated tagging software according to them the bird solution took us less than 5 years to build though it's definitely a hard problem and we've still got room for improvement
