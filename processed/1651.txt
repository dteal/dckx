n in some cities automated parking systems aka robotic garages are used to reduce the amount of space needed to store cars as opposed to traditional parking buildings the robotic system eliminates the needs for ramps and circulation/reversing areas normally they work by having the user drive their car onto an elevator and get out after which the elevator lifts or lowers the car into a compact storage space here cueball drives up to what he believes to be a garage of this type operated by black hat however instead of an elevator carefully moving it into a storage space a robotic claw simply picks up the car and dumps it in a bin of cars this type of parking option will not only break the car but also make it impossible to take out if the car is at the bottom hence the cars are stacked cueball reacts quite well to this treatment of his car when black hat tells him that later they just dump out the bin full of cars and he can then pick his own out from the pile maybe he knows black hat well enough not to try to argue with him this is of course not possible with such heavy objects cueball continues to be benign about this absurd situation which becomes even more absurd when he asks if black hat could at least make sure his car is not at the bottom when it is dumped out with all the other cars but black hat falls back on his excuse robots aren't magic implying that such a feat is beyond the realm of possibility it would of course be quite possible to prevent the damage that cueball fears if they were using a normal automated parking system in the title text he at least gives cueball an option he can borrow an axe if it is really important for him to get the car out from the pile although in this situation an axe would be a nearly useless tool which knowing him is most likely black hat's intent only allowing cueball to laboriously hack through any other car that lies in the way on top of his own; and still it would not help much because if his car is at the bottom it will be even more destroyed than from just being dumped into the bin to begin with this is just one of many situations where black hat has an evil or just mean/crazy plan in progress it's for instance not the first time that black hat has treated other people's car with great disrespect although in 562 parking the guy with the car had it coming
