n the comic depicts an average everyday scene a party with drinks dancing and a lot of commotion going on hence the title amid the chaos though there are two people megan and cueball staring wistfully at each other they both think of the same scene the two of them sitting on branches of a large and bare tree doing something on laptops the implication is that these two people are special they don't derive their enjoyment of life from parties or other typical teenage activities but rather simpler more quiet activities this is evidenced by the fact that everything other than megan and cueball and the plastic cups are greyed out the title text presents a simpler joke it is rather difficult to get down from a tree especially when carrying a fragile item like a laptop it may also refer to the design of the tree that has been drawn as it lacks visible branches below cueball's perch
