n despite randall being enthusiastic about receiving ink pens his first experiment with them has resulted in a rather bleak comic instead of multiple panels the entire comic is a single drawing but as we travel down the page there is an apparent passage of time or unless a better phrase can be found the degree of falling apart the comic seems to be expressing what it feels like when a relationship falls apart and one of the implications is that the process cannot easily be reversed at the top of the page we see some people standing alone apparently happy enough and a couple as we descend the page we see examples of a couple split by a narrow chasm someone isolated and alone on their own world fragment a couple desperately trying to hang on to each other and a single figure falling chaotically and without control   these figures are on a comic and the representation is of what happens when their world xe2x80x94 the page xe2x80x94 literally falls apart the implication is that this matches the actual feelings of people going through relationship breakups in short it is catastrophic the identity of '#pugglewumper tashari' the supplier of the pens is not known judging by the use of the hash sign it is someone with whom randall communicates in irc in fact 'pugglewump' appears to be an irc channel although hashtags later came to be strongly associated with twitter this was not true at the time the comic was drawn
