n infinite scrolling is a technique in web design where a large data set is displayed as a seemingly infinite list but in reality only the visible part of the list and the surrounding data is rendered this is done to work around memory limitations of old browsers and mobile devices or to save on data transfer size the problem with this technique is that if you navigate from this page to a different page and go back the location of the scrolled data set is often lost and the top of the data set is displayed again also it is usually not possible to point a url directly to a certain section of the infinite list a practice known as deep linking for these reasons many prefer pagination the method traditionally used in books over infinite scrolling in this comic megan is handling the book gingerly as if it were a device with a touchscreen where the book is displayed as an infinite scrolling text touching a link would navigate away from the list and the current reading position would be lost in the title text it is an ironic suggestion that the back button is now useless the back button is supposed to give you this functionality but due to the failure to implement continuous scrolling sites and deep linking correctly they are typically useless when the user is reading infinite scrolling data or worse flat out counterproductive giving you the wrong page
