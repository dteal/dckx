n in this comic hairy is preparing for his date with ponytail and has just finished with a shower as seen from the fact that he is wearing a towel around his waist ironically this makes him more dressed than at any other time ponytail is even more ironically wearing nothing at all he is also preparing mentally by thinking about which situations he might encounter during the date since he cannot know for sure he is performing a blind search in his head when doing a blind search in computing there are two main tacticsxe2x80x94depth first search dfs and breadth first search bfs  hairy uses the dfs technique as indicated in the comic title which means going as far as you possibly can down one path before looking at other possibilities this turns out to be a bad idea as hairy's searches takes him out of a tangent instead of preparing for his date hairy instead spent the whole time doing research on snake venom to the exclusion of even getting dressed in time for the arrival of his date the way the last panel is the only panel and at the far right in the second row vs four panels in the top row indicates all the time he has used on dfs and although he may realize his mistake throwing up his arms he has to tell ponytail the fact he has found out that the inland taipan's has the deadliest venom of any snake see more below by contrast a breadth first search will look only minimally into a topic before moving on to another; any new depth exposed by this minimal check will be added to a list of stuff to do later this would have allowed hairy to briefly check many more things within the time allotted and probably still have been able to get dressed the relationship advice given in the title text on using breadth first search may not be meant too seriously however one might be more sure about what kind of person one is looking for after already having dated a few people but then the right one might have slipped by it is by no means certain that you can return to one of the first persons you dated after having dated another dozen  it is however not very useful if you wish to have a stable family life to only be with a person for five years so dfs is for sure a bad way to find out who you wish to spend you life with one might conclude that blind search is not a good way to find your significant other but for most people there is no other way to search hairy also has a situation where he goes out of a tangent in 1518 typical morning routine
