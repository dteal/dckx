n randall is showing the number of still living humans who have walked on another world for the 65 year period that begins in 1969 when a human first walked on the moon up to 2011 when the comic was drawn he has drawn a single line for the actual figures for the subsequent years he has drawn three lines using actuarial tables or life tables such tables show for each age the probability that a certain person will die within the next year the line marked 5th percentile indicates that there is a 95% probability that the number alive in a given year will be above that line and a 5% probability that the number alive will be below that line  for example this line indicates a 5% chance that all apollo moon walkers will be dead by 2023 and a 95% chance that at least one will still be alive by that year the line marked 95th percentile indicates that there is a 5% probability that the number alive in a given year will be above that line and a 95% probability that the number alive will be below that line  for example this line indicates a 95% chance that all apollo moon walkers will be dead by 2035 and a 5% chance that at least one will still be alive by that year the middle line is not identified but is probably the 50th percentile see these tables  if so it indicates that there is a 50% probability that the number alive in a given year will be above that line and a 50% probability that the number alive will be below that line  for example this line indicates a 50% chance that all apollo moon walkers will be dead by 2028 see previous link and a 50% chance that at least one will still be alive by that year although the term other world would include all other worlds on which humans have walked there is currently only one other world on which humans have walked which is the moon  the humans that have walked there are the 12 apollo astronauts who landed on the moon between 1969 and 1972 in particular neil armstrong and buzz aldrin landed in july 1969 pete conrad and alan bean landed in november alan shepard and edgar mitchell february 1971 david scott and james irwin july 1971 john young and charles duke april 1972 eugene cernan and harrison schmitt december 1972 irwin died in 1991 shepard and conrad died in 1998 and 1999 respectively making the total 9 as of the date this comic was published armstrong died in 2012 and mitchell in 2016 so the current number is 7 the oldest living person to have landed on the moon is aldrin 86 there is one 86 year old one 85 two 83s one 81 and two 80s the chart assumes that no other humans will go to walk on another world within the time frame plotted and the title text implies that this is primarily an economically determined decision while noting that not exploring space is a justifiable and sensible decision which may also be made by many hypothetical cultures on other worlds the text implies a grandness to a civilization that would be given the opportunity to discover study and memorialize the 'one world graves' of other civilizations by choosing to explore space despite the economic difficulty high five for exoplanet archaeology
