n in this comic cueball attends a math class after having been awake for two full days 48 hours after that he begins to hallucinate and dreams that the teacher miss lenhart a professor in this comic answers megan's question about a proof that there are an infinite number of prime numbers in haiku after the first line she floats up and during the third and final line she flies over the students heads basically it is a dream as also indicated with cueball's thought that are outside this lucid dream where it could be seen as it was the entire comic except cueball's thoughts that are inside the dream bubble dreams being a recurring theme in xkcd note also that where cueball looks up after the flying teacher when she takes off megan never moves her head to watch her teacher fly because it's not happening in her world and cueball only dream the teachers moves euclid's theorem states that there are an infinite number of primes prime numbers being numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1 the most notable proof of this theorem and the one presented in this comic was first given by euclid himself in his elements a more traditional form of this proof follows  if we suppose that there are a finite number of primes then they must have a product ie p1p2pn = q now consider q + 1 if this number is prime itself then we have discovered a new prime number contrary to the assumption that we had listed them all if it is not prime it must have a prime divisor since all of the pk are a factor of q they cannot be a divisor of q + 1 so q + 1 is divisible by a prime not on the list which again is a contradiction therefore there must be infinitely many primes  the comic essentially takes this proof and states it in the form of a haiku which is a traditional form of japanese poetry which is in japanese broken up into patterns of morae or syllables a unit that measures the length of sound a haiku consists of three lines with 5 7 and 5 syllables respectively per line an english haiku has 5 7 and 5 syllables per line and the proof poem goes like this  top prime's divisors' product plus one's factors are qed bitches  which can be divided in syllables like this  top prime's di vi sors' pro duct plus one's fac tors are q e  d bit ches  the haiku proof given is slightly off as the first line talks about the top prime's divisors which makes no sense because the top prime doesn't have any divisors besides itself and one you need to take the product of all primes not just one but hey it's a hallucination haiku was also referred to before in 554 not enough work the comic and title text conclude that going to class while sleep deprived is an interesting but entirely noneducational experience so do go for the sake of the hallucinations
