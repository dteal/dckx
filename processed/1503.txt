n these particular squirrels are ambitious but misguided like the characters in the myth of icarus and daedalus or the tower of babel the squirrels' understanding of astrophysics is lacking regarding the distance to the sun and appropriate transportation to reach it in addition to the need to resist the sun's heat and exist in the vacuum of space it can be seen as a joke about how limited the knowledge of humans still is regarding many advanced topics of science the idea of taking a balloon to the moon or the sun might not have been immediately rejected even a few hundred years ago and the fanciful notion of a sun filled with acorns the ultimate object in a squirrel's reality is reminiscent of many early human ideas about heaven and celestial objects even the common old myth that the moon might be made out of cheese the title text reveals that halfway to the sun 75 million kilometers from all known acorns in our universe the airborne squirrel seems to jeopardize the entire mission because he wants to test if the balloon itself is full of acorns basic observational skills will tell anyone that acorns do not float but the idea follows the logic stated by the squirrels  if the sun being so magnificent must be full of acorns then a balloon powerful enough to take a squirrel to the sun must also be powered by something amazing like acorns in the real world helium balloons cannot escape the stratosphere  perhaps the squirrel only thinks he's halfway to the sun or maybe the acorns in the balloon are pushing on the quantum vacuum virtual plasma alternate hypothesis this scene is almost identical to a scene found in the recent movie kingsman tss the comic may also be referencing larry walters more commonly known as lawnchair larry who flew into the air on a lawn chair strapped to several balloons specifically the reference is in the squirrel shooting the balloon out as larry planned to descend by shooting the balloons with a bb gun
