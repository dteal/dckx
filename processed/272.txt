n best buy is an american chain of electronics and media stores as with many such big box shops they only sell pre bundled software and boxed pre built hardware where the computers on offer are either macs or other pcs usually pre installed with some variant of the mac os x or windows nt operating system families most personal computer hackers/enthusiasts as opposed merely to workaday computer users wouldn't be caught dead buying a pre made computer preferring instead to build their own using self selected hardware components and install and configure their own preferred operating systems and software as such the subtext is that somebody buying a complete pre packaged home computer system at best buy wouldn't know or care much about computers the salesperson is trying to sell antivirus software to cueball because selling such software eg norton or kaspersky to prospective windows pc owners is generally a good sales tactic the vast majority of all computer malware is engineered specifically to exploit windows and windows' inherent anti malware protection might most charitably be described with the phrase lacklustre but not as bad as before windows users therefore will want antivirus protection especially for use on a brand new machine that will soon be connected up to the internet moreover because the ecosystem of viruses and malware which thrive by infecting windows pcs is constantly evolving see 350 network and being redesigned to take advantage of new exploits and fool last month's antivirus software it is quite prudent for a windows pc owner to always keep their malware protection absolutely up to date and many such security suites need to be regularly renewed with new versions while some viruses and malware can afflict linux in general unix and workalike operating systems of its type eg bsd are far more robust and secure than windows with fewer exploitable vulnerabilities; so cueball is confident probably rightly so that he will be fine without added security moreover linux is free software so although malware protection usually isn't necessary for it excepting for tasks requiring very high security standards such as on servers and supercomputers if extra protection is desired by the user it is generally easily obtainable often gratis back in 2007 after the commercial failure that was windows vista and with a stagnant mac market many in the linux community believed that linux would soon wipe out windows as the operating system of choice for desktop pcs after years of slow but steady growth this explains the cheeky triumphalism of the final panels of the comic in which cueball hops on his quick slick vehicle and speeds away it's worth noting that   this desktop reversal has not happened though  linux did achieve a peak in popularity in 2011 just as windows users were laboriously switching from windows xp to windows 7 with linux peaking again in 2014 and windows arguably in decline and in any case  desktop pcs themselves have slowed in sales losing ground first to laptops and most recently to embedded devices where linux does indeed heavily excel its competition eg android handily outcompeting both the previously dominant iphone which was first released mere days after this comic as well as the never popular windows phone  the title text makes sense in light of the fact that like linux the software design of os x both are based on unix os x through darwin see 676 abstraction limits the amount of harm that can be done by malicious software and macs thus also have fewer viruses and malware than windows apparently mac and linux users flock together just waiting for some salesperson to come along and mistake them for someone gullible enough to use windows this is taking the piss out of the smugness sometimes to be found among mac and linux users who may view their preferred systems as hip and different from the mainstream microsoft systems which they feel are manifestly inferior
