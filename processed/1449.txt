n this comic shows what the landmasses of pangaea were hypothesized to have looked like when it had just broken up in the late triassic period roughly 200 million years ago shortly after the separation of pangaea the two supercontinents laurasia northern supercontinent and gondwana southern supercontinent formed after this continental drift the process by which landmasses moving over the earth's mantle collide and separate brought them into the configuration we see today the top map shows the landmass laurasia declaring red rover red rover send india over as if the continents were playing the game red rover in the second map we can see how gondwana actually sends over the indian subcontinent to laurasia in the game of red rover the aim is for an individual to charge into the opposing team who are holding hands and attempt to cause a break in the human chain if the individual succeeds they take one of the opposing teams members back to their own team if the chain doesn't break the individual joins that team in the game portrayed here an isolated landmass india in contemporary geography is the individual charging towards the laurasian landmass attempting to break through we know of course that india failed in this attempt and as per the games rules joined the laurasia 'team' this part of the supercontinent later developed in to asia it is accepted that the himalayas the highest elevated mountain range on earth formed by the collision of india into what is now asia for various reasons the movement of the indian plate from its location in gondwana 90&#160;million years ago to its impact point with the rest of asia 50&#160;million years ago was extremely rapid as plate movements go at about 20&#160;cm per year the idea that the landmasses on earth are sentient and moving about in an incredibly slow game of red rover with india's rapid movement being a result of being called over is not one which is currently scientifically accepted&#91;citation needed&#93; the title text refers to the slide mountain ocean which was located between the intermontane islands and north america in the triassic period beginning around 245&#160;million years ago the name interests randall because oceans bodies of water mountains land masses and slides playground equipment are mutually exclusive concepts when using the most common definitions in this case however slide is short for landslide which is a common feature of mountains slide mountain is a particular mountain in british columbia the result of the remnant of the slide mountain microplate which accreted onto the continent becoming the slide mountain terrane as the majority of the microplate was subducted slide mountain ocean refers to the sea between the slide mountain microplate before it was subducted under what is now north america
