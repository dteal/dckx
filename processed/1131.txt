n in another election themed comic this one posted the day after the 2012 us presidential election november 7 2012 see also 1122 electoral precedent 500 election 1127 congress and 1130 poll watching this comic shows a bar graph representing expected see note below electoral college votes in the election including a dotted line indicating the 270 votes needed to win a span of projections forecast and the actual result the forecast range is above the 270 line showing that the blue candidate obama the democratic candidate is the blue candidate and the republican candidate is the red candidate according to a convention used since the 2000 election was always projected to win by statisticians like nate silver and others the only question among these people was how much he was going to win by the electoral college votes are expectations until the official voting result is announced early in november by contrast most of the media was calling the election too close to call with some news outlets actually projecting a romney win essentially the large number of republican pundits who helped increase the pressures of right wing self referencing media denial the tendency of media to give any issue at least two dramatically or fictionally equal voices for supposed fairness regardless of the relative merits of the two sides and the desire to present the election as a suspenseful horse race resulted in a lot of talking heads ie pundits disbelieving the polls these factors shaped the too close to call narrative leading to the punch line of this story you don't need to believe in science or statistics for it to effectively describe or predict reality the progressively more radicalized republicans of this era are known for disregarding scientific or statistical consensus which reflects reality but does not conform to their world view for those unfamiliar with the us presidential electoral process unlike other political offices the election for president is not a direct election instead each state is apportioned a certain number of electoral college votes based on population for the most part and there is perennial discussion on whether this should be changed the candidate that receives the most votes in a given state receives all the electoral college votes for that state with 538 electoral votes total receiving 270 electoral college votes half of 538 + 1 is sufficient to be declared president elect for this reason sometimes one candidate actually receive more popular votes more people voted for the candidate but have fewer electoral college votes this happened three times in the nineteenth century with elections of john quincy adams in 1824 rutherford b hayes in 1876 and benjamin harrison in 1888 then it did not happen again until the election of george w bush in 2000
