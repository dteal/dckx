n where's waldo the north american renaming of the british where's wally is a children's puzzle book in which you have to locate 'waldo' a character with a distinctive striped shirt and hat in a picture crowded with hundreds of characters this is harder than it sounds since the characters are both very small and quite densely packed on the page and the pages especially in later books are often littered with decoy characters wearing similar articles of clothing to waldo's cueball and his friend are using satellite imaging to find waldo by holding the book up to the sky and viewing it on the computer presumably using some advanced image processing software to identify waldo among the crowd this would require a very advanced camera as resolutions are usually much lower than would be necessary to resolve the characters in a where's waldo book but since cueball works at the national reconnaissance office nro he probably has access to some powerful satellites and image processing software the humor in this being while he could be using that power for much more important things he's instead trying to solve a simple game further cueball and his friend could probably hook up the image parsing software to a smaller camera on the ground rather than a satellite mounted camera they would get even better results without using a camera by scanning the image and running it through the same image processing software the title text is implying that cueball has accidentally launched a drone at the co ordinates which would be where he and his friend are standing the drone is presumably a military drone armed with explosive weaponry xe2x80x94 not a good thing for those on the receiving end
