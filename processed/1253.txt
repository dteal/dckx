n on the 14th august 2013 the international astronomical union iau issued a document about public naming of astronomical objects it stated iau fully supports the involvement of the general public whether directly or through an independent organized vote in the naming of planetary satellites newly discovered planets and their host stars the text above the image states the fact above and then notes that the iau immediately regret this decision as we can see from cueball's question and from ponytail's facepalm and the fact that even megan is speechless the suggestions are appalling it becomes even worse when hairbun tells them that an automatic filter has already been applied to the results one designed to remove inappropriate entries that don't meet certain criteria this implies that the list would have been even worse if presented in its unfiltered form as seen below in the table the naming document also contained amongst other things guidelines that suggested names should meet these include stipulations such as 16 characters or less preferably one word being pronounceable in as many languages as possible not too similar to an existing name of an astronomical object avoiding commercial names and being respectful of intellectual property if we go down the list we can see that many of randall's suggestions do indeed violate the guidelines which is part of the joke as it reflects the tendency of internet submissions to ignore such softly suggested guidelines the randomness and inappropriateness of the suggested names reflects the commonly expected response from anonymous submitters on the internet many forums and contests that call for online response and do not apply strict control over the responses receive similar collections of random inappropriate and obscure submissions that are often only tangentially related to the original subject for example greenpeace held a naming contest for one of the whales recently tagged in their research and preservation campaign and even after selecting the finalists the online voting resulted in naming the whale mr splashypants pepsico had even less restrictive controls in their marketing campaign that asked the internet to name a new flavour of mountain dew they had to shut down the contest in order to avoid naming the new beverage hitler did nothing wrong which was the current leader at the time and only marginally the most inappropriate of the top ten voted suggestions even more recently is the case of boaty mcboatface in which the internet decided to dub a british research vessel boaty mcboatface the boast was given the name rrs sir david attenborough in the end with its autonomous underwater vehicle being called boaty mcboatface the document also states that naming suggestions may be sent to the email that randall included in the title text this comic was updated in 1555 exoplanet names 2     star   planet   suggested name   explanation    gliese 667   b   space planet   a very unoriginal name; every planet is in space   c   pilf   pun of milf ie planet i'd like to fuck planet c is a relatively hot planet within the habitable zone   d   a star   a star is obviously a bad name for a planet a* pronounced a star is already used in in astronomy for example the milky way's black hole core is sagittarius a* a star is also the name for the character asterisk and the name of the popular a* search algorithm in computer science   e   e'; drop table planets;     a reference to sql injection riffing off of comic 327 which featured a schoolboy named robert'; drop table students;    the idea here is that the iau would enter the name into their system and promptly lose all of their data pertaining to planets  note that planet e is located in the habitable zone of the star system   f   blogosphere   weird blog related terms are a recurring theme in xkcd see for instance comic 181   g   blogodrome   h   earth   planet candidate h is about the mass of the earth and described as tantalizing a dynamically packed planetary system around gj with three super earths in its habitable zone see also 1231 habitable zone    tau ceti   b   sid meier's tau&#160;ceti&#160;b   this refers to the game sid meier's alpha centauri    c   giant dog planet   vy canis majoris is one of the largest known stars at our galaxy and belongs to the constellation canis major latin for greater dog the constellation further contains sirius the brightest star in the night sky also called dog star   d   tiny dog planet   cf canis minor latin for lesser dog another constellation   e   phil plainet   a reference to phil plait aka the bad astronomer   f   unicode snowman   the unicode character
