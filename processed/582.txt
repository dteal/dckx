n a car's brakes fail on a winding mountain road as a response the driver calls a live radio phone in show overlooking the fact that he is in immediate danger and has no time to gather outside advice before improvising a solution the driver loses control of the car and plunges over a cliff  if this ever happens to you  try pumping the brakes it may rebuild enough pressure to slow you down downshift into second and then first gear which should limit your vehicle's speed use your emergency brake it's not just for parking otherwise find a safe place to coast to a stop if possible or else try to wreck your car in a way that won't kill you or your passengers aim for something that will slow you down before stopping you like a gravel turnout or a stand of bushes  http//wwwwikihowcom/stop a car with no brakes the title text refers to tom and ray magliozzi who were the co hosts of the weekly radio show car talk it was a car advice/comedy radio show often aired on npr stations while there is some actual advice given on the radio show it's presented as a comedy/entertainment show much of the show did involve the hosts gasping and hacking as they ask non relevant questions of the callers and add their own commentary or relate other personal asides and stories since he claims that he has 65 funny seconds he must have connected with them way before going over the cliff because in 65 seconds a car would fall approximately 200 m xc2xbd*g*t^2 with g = 981 m/s^2 and t the time in seconds this will give 207 m but there will be a lot of air resistance it is clear from the drawing that the call is still going almost straight out into the air so it is still almost at the height where it left the road at quite a high speed to get this far away without turning the engine down towards earth yet and the front of the car is just about 5 car length to the ground which would make this a 10 15 m drop only which would take less than 2 seconds to fall but according to the comic it seems like he first connected with the show just when the car has left the road
