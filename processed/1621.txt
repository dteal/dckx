n the second christmas comic in a row the first being 1620 christmas settings this comic was released on christmas day as a present from randall to all physicists it introduces a new particle the fixion which explains everything the word fixion can be read as a pun either it can mean something like fix i on withon being a suffix for many particles and this particle being able to fix things; or it means fiction in physics there are still many big questions and mysteries there are many phenomena which don't seem to fit and we don't know how to explain yet the fixion is satirically presented as a particle which acts as a deus ex machina see also tvtropes which solves all of these mysteries without any serious fundamental reasons the style of the chart suggests a feynman diagram an easy way of drawing particle interactions every time there is an interaction the main central fixion line changes direction typically fermions the solid particles like electrons and quarks are shown with solid lines photons and generally the weak force carrying bosons are shown with wavy lines gluons with spiraling lines and other mediating particles such as pions in the nuclear force or the higgs boson with a dotted line randall obeys these rules only very loosely which makes sense many of the things involved in this feynman diagram are either so theoretical that they have no widely used standard representation or would never appear in a sensible diagram spacecrafts for instance all mentioned types of lines and even more types are presented in the diagram all that the fixion does is described in the table below the title text is a continuation of one of the jokes already mentioned in the main comic fourth phrase from the top to the left about fast radio bursts frbs and perytons see explanation in the last entry in the table below
