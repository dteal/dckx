n cueball is trying to decide if he wants to stay with ponytail who he is currently dating or leave her and have a relationship with megan the comic suggests that no matter which one he chooses he will never truly achieve happiness because of his longing for the option he chose not to take in a sense this is a no win situation no matter what he does of interesting stuff sex or otherwise with ponytail he will be thinking forever of megan and vice versa this even goes on after he dies where he lies next to one of them and thinks he would rather have been buried next to the other girl the title text is referring to a concept in computer science all comparison based sorting algorithms are incapable of sorting an arbitrary set of n values faster than an order of n*logn on the other hand non comparison sorting algorithms eg bucket sort with external knowledge of the distribution of the values can sort them with order n if cueball was capable of establishing an external scale he could use a non comparison sort but as he does not know what the best thing for him is he is stuck with comparisons and thus he can't achieve better performance this comic is possibly a sequel to 310 commitment
