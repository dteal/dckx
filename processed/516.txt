n cueball has tried to play an elaborate hoax on a woman involving wood chips that match the composition of the wood used to build a 19th century ghost ship called the mary celeste unfortunately the woman has done the sensible reasonable thing and thrown them out instead of checking to see if they belong to a ghost ship whose wood chips or what have you would probably not have found their way to the hallway this causes cueball to realize that he needs to rethink the complicated way in which he creates hoaxes because the people he is trying to trick do not follow through with his elaborate plans the title text suggests that he also set up some kind of chemical match with the shroud of turin the shroud of turin is a famous artifact said by some to have been used as jesus's burial cloth containing the ghostly image of a face a chemical analysis was performed on it in the late 1980s which appeared to prove the cloth was medieval in origin; however not everyone has fully accepted this finding
