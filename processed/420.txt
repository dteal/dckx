n in the first four stanzas of this soliloquy cueball reminisces fondly about his meeting of megan at a party where they quickly had a romantic rapport and spent the night together the next two stanzas are a lamentation that megan is now married and can never have that same experience again the final stanza reveals that this is not merely cueball waxing poetic about a previous love but that he is actually making a toast as the best man at megan's wedding reception certainly an occasion when it is wildly inappropriate to discuss the previous romantic involvements of the bride in modern times it is not unexpected that the bride at a wedding will have had previous relationships with someone other than the groom but a wedding is no time to mention them the title text implies that the groom had no prior knowledge of cueball and megan's dalliance and therefore the toast is even more inappropriate going beyond discussing the previous romantic history of the bride to actually revealing previously unknown such history to the groom presumably cueball's having been selected to be best man indicates that he is a good friend of the groom as the groom normally selects the best man the title hints that cueball is envious of the groom since his previous encounter with megan clearly did not result in a lasting relationship while the groom's clearly did this suggests that he may be intentionally perhaps drunkenly making an inappropriate toast to embarrass the couple as a result of his bitterness
