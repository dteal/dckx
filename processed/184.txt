n a rotational matrix transformation ie the big brackets with a few cos and sin in them is used in computer graphics to rotate an image in general to rotate a point a1 a2 in a 2d space by zxc2xb0 clockwise you can multiply it by the rotation matrix cos zxc2xb0 sin zxc2xb0;sin zxc2xb0 cos zxc2xb0 in this case the left side of the equation is rotating a1 a2 by 90xc2xb0 simplifying the trigonometry the 90xc2xb0 clockwise rotation matrix is  0 1;1 0 so multiplying this by a1 a2 you should get a2a1  the joke is that the author performed the rotation transformation on the image of the vector rather than just the vector itself  rotational matrix transformations are a special case of the general linear matrix transform which can do other things to images including the other two affine transformations of scaling them or translating moving them  on a pedantic note normally mathematics uses counterclockwise as a default although computer graphics frequently use a clockwise default so this may be an intentional reference so the title text may be referring to the professors going home translation and shrinking scaling from the joke
