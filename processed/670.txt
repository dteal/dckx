n this comic is in reference to the 1984 mock documentary this is spinal tap about the tour of the fictional rock band spinal tap here we see lead guitarist nigel tufnel a character portrayed in the movie by christopher guest explaining to cueball how the volume dial on his amp goes all the way to eleven this is impressive to nigel since guitar amplifiers generally only go to ten this leads him to believe his amp is one louder than other amplifiers in reality the loudness of an amplifier is largely dependent on how much power it has  the highest mark on the volume dial could just as easily be labelled 'maximum' which would then accurately describe the meaning of that setting the normal guy knows intuitively that using eleven is silly and wants to know what is wrong with the usual way of numbering from one to ten  the question that is raised in the original film the engineer is desperate to explain to nigel the fallacy in his thinking but his jargon just sends nigel to sleep  he remains unenlightened the smart engineer sees an opportunity it doesn't cost any more to number the volume dial differently but nigel places a real value on higher numbers  the smart engineer offers to sell him an amp that goes to twelve but at a hefty premium  the title text further plays on the fact that the amp's levels are on an arbitrary scale many products are sold at a certain price per unit weight volume etc eg $299/lb for grapes nigel calculates that the $2000 amp would cost less than $200 per something but he is unable to articulate what the something is confirming the third panel observation of the normal engineer however he decides that it's a good deal anyway and it looks like the smart engineer has made a sale
