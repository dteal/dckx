n kickstarter is a platform for funding creative projects in which anyone can give money at any level of funding starting usually as low as $10 funding at different levels gets you different perks eg if the kickstarter is for a book a large donation makes you eligible for a signed copy in this comic black hat is attempting to game the system by raising money to work on the perfect kickstarter pitch he appears to have gained no money but has only started the scheme that day the irony of the title text is that you do not need to be on any vip list to have dibs on the pledge levels anyone can give any amount of money that is the goal of kickstarter and it has been wildly successful this has actually been done via an indiegogo campaign there are a number of similarities to the comic black hat $500 vs $5000 goal so baron von husk may have gotten the idea from xkcd
