n the student's t distribution is a class of probability distribution used in statistics to model small sample sizes student was the pseudonym of william gosset an employee of guinness brewery who discovered it a student's t distribution is similar to a normal symmetric bell curve distribution but has fatter tails; thus the one shown in the comic is roughly the right shape  a teacher's t distribution is a joke pun made up by randall the comic is a play on the name student the pseudonym of the creator versus the teacher the idea is that a teacher's distribution would be more complex and that it would be used for fitting data when the student's distribution wasn't sophisticated enough of course in actuality such a complex distribution as the one shown in the comic would have many parameters and in practice would probably lead to overfitting and/or bias thus the comic and the title text can be seen as making fun of the idea that more complex is always better or perhaps of the idea that a statistician's job is to use more and more sophisticated tools to force the data to yield a publishable result rather than to use the simplest appropriate tool and let the chips fall where they may  cueball tries to fit a distribution to the data on the paper this is the usual jargon for when a statistician is trying to model his/her data as coming from some underlying probability distribution and the comic makes a pun with the physical meaning of fit in the second panel cueball decides that the student's t distribution does not fit his data well the data failed the student t test and decides to pull out the more complex teachers t distribution instead the teachers t test which the data is not allowed to continue to fail note that test is what statisticians do to data to see if it fits some distribution but it is also another word for examination the students t distribution relates the average of a small sample to the true population average under the assumptions unobjectionable in many contexts that there is such a true value and that the samples are independent and normally distributed with equal variance as such unless the data on cueball's paper contain many small groups which radically violate these assumptions somehow there is no way cueball's data could falsify the t distribution in particular a single number for the average of one group or a small set of numbers for the averages of several numbers will never make a nice smooth curve but an average statistician would see that as normal statistical noise that would even out over time not as a reason to prefer a complex spiky curve such as the supposed teacher's distribution but of course cueball's access to a secret cooler looking distribution makes them more badass than a mere average statistician or does it ironically the teacher's t distribution shows equal variance itself proving the appropriateness of the student's t distribution the title text plays on the word test the first part of the sentence refers to a potential teacher t test which would be used in a statistical context to test for the significance of some observation as opposed to the real student's t test which is used to determine if two sets of data differ by a statistically significant amount on the other hand the second part of the sentence refers to the possibility for students to take tests or exams until they pass or to teachers who forces students to take the test again and again until they pass the resulting sentence may refer to statistical fallacy or the conscious or unconscious action of manipulating observations or misconducting experiments to give statistical significance to a false fact
