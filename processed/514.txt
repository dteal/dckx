n this comic links to enwikipediaorg/wiki/relativity_of_simultaneity cueball and megan are talking about the sex they just had cueball is remarking on how they both achieved orgasm simultaneously but megan disagrees this comic is a play on einstein's theory of special relativity one piece of the theory deals with two observers who are moving at close to the speed of light relative to each other according to einstein events that appear simultaneous to one observer will appear to happen at different times to the other so when one partner is moving and the other isn't it's possible that they experience their orgasm at different times relative to each other that would require one partner to be moving really fast in one direction which would make him or her either a really bad partner or a really good one on small speeds this effect could not be measured the other joke is that partners often disagree with each other xe2x80x94 even when the difference is minor and not important to the matter the title text is reference to the twin paradox which arises from another piece of special relativity in theory if you stick one twin on a spaceship at near light speed and keep the other back on earth the former will only experience a few years while the latter will age decades megan or cueball if he rolls that way expresses a preference for the older twin who will be more mature meaning both older and less combative about simultaneity
