n black hat has created a set of tools that work in complete silence so that he can go to the house of the chairman of the american skeptics society late at night do some rearranging of walls and moving of windows just to screw with him in typical black hat fashion a skeptic is someone who questions knowledge facts and beliefs especially of supernatural phenomena like the existence of poltergeists which black hat is trying to imitate with his rearranging and scratching noises the american skeptics society is a non profit organization dedicated to promoting skeptical and critical thinking in education and public discourse the executive diretor and chief editor of the skeptic magazine michael shermer is a leading proponent of skepticism and has written many books and articles debunking pseudoscience fringe science quack medicine alien abductions conspiracy theories and supernatural phenomena the skeptic society website 1 and skeptic magazine feature a lot of material debunking anecdotal accounts of these phenomena explaining how events like hauntings could have occurred without supernatural intervention one of the premises of modern skepticism is that the supernatural is not rejected out of hand; if a skeptic ever encountered an event with no possible explanation other than a supernatural one he would be forced to acknowledge the existence of that type of supernatural force or entity skeptics maintain that no such event has ever occurred black hat's prank is designed to give mr shermer a seemingly supernatural experience that he would not be able to debunk so he would have to accept a supernatural explanation to the detriment of his life's work and that of the society he runs in the title text cueball realizes that black hat has probably intentionally ruined his antique table by demonstrating his silent hammer black hat's tools are seen in two boxes labelled drills and non drills likely a reference to the phrase this is not a drill used to differentiate an emergent situation from a practice of procedure for such the particularly evil nature of this comic even for black hat might be because this is comic number 666 which is the number of the beast
