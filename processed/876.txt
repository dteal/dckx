n the 911 operator references plato's cave this is a reference to an allegory by plato in which he creates a world in which prisoners are chained against a wall and know only the shadows that cross the wall and how they create their own reality from those shadows they would create words for the things they were seeing but that would only correspond to the shadows and not the physical things themselves  cueball's brain seems to be unaware it is in his body and is freaked out by the fact that all the information it receives is through cueball's sensory organs the brain has no means of verifying that the information received from the senses indeed corresponds to the actual outside world and is thus in plato's cave the title text continues with the plato's cave and takes it literally; randall is saying that socrates plato's teacher should have just gone into the cave and brought the prisoners out instead of dealing with the extended allegory the tranquilizer gun is for the prisoners so they don't completely freak out while being taken out of the cave
