n this comic is a parody of charles dickens's a christmas carol where scrooge is replaced with a grammar nazi and speaks to the irrelevance of correcting people's speech in a christmas carol the ghosts of christmas past present and future awaken the main character in the middle of the night to show him the negative causes and effects of his selfish and uncharitable behavior where in this comic the ghost wakes up a grammar nazi who is intent on correcting people's usage of the word literally people often use literally as emphasis to a figurative statement a statement like i literally ate 40 lbs of chocolate might be said when what was intended was  i ate like 40 lbs of chocolate a ghost awakens the main character in the middle of the night to show him the effects of correcting people's usage of the word literally he shows the protagonist two futures one where he keeps correcting people and one where he stops that the two different futures are exactly ie literally the same suggests that the man's struggle to get people to stop using literally incorrectly will have no meaningful effect on the world and so the man and by extension everyone else may as well stop wasting time and energy on it ironically the title text indicates that a second apparition encouraged the man to continue the fight on a different grammatical issue the use of the phrase if it were which is frequently incorrectly substituted with if it was were is correctly used in a hypothetical condition when referencing something that may not be true the ghost of subjunctive past references the ghost of christmas past and the 'subjunctive past tense' the following sentences illustrate the correct usages  if i were rich i wouldn't have to work for a living when i was rich i didn't have to work for a living  another xkcd comic 725 literally also refers to the overly mocked usage of literally a similar ghost is seen in 1393 timeghost where it reminds cueball about the passing of time
