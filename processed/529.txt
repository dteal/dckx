n cueball and megan have a perfectly normal sled ride down a perfectly normal hill engaging in what's traditionally a children's pastime while cueball is complaining that he has grown too old for certain things like learning another language fluently but not for taking a sleigh ride although he does not really seem to enjoy it though there is a theory called critical period hypothesis that you can only learn a language fluently before a certain age  cueball hates that options are closed to him and feels like he has given up a life that was once possible the joke is that this reminds megan about their anniversary coming up this means that she feels that she has given up a life that was once possible by staying so long with cueball actually this may be the time when they are going to break up the reader would thus have expected something ironic to happen at the end of the trip but instead the only humor in the last frame arises from their commentary on the lack of humor calvin and hobbes is an acclaimed newspaper comic strip that ran from 1985 to 1995 calvin is a six year old child with an active imagination and hobbes is his stuffed tiger who calvin perceives to be alive through his imagination the two frequently had philosophical conversations often while sledding calvin sledded on densely wooded hills near where he lived and the ride would often serve as a perfect parallel to the conversation they were having; for example in one strip calvin talks about how seemingly mundane decisions can nonetheless have lasting consequences by pointing out how all of the things they see as they continue down the hill and eventually crash into a ravine are a direct result of him having taken a particular fork early on the title text notes that if you did have calvin and hobbes toboggan it would be the worst place to have a breaking up conversation because then the sled itself would literally break up during the journey with potentially dangerous consequences this is also the clue to the fact that the comic is in fact about a break up situation calvin and hobbes is also referenced in 409 electric skateboard double comic
