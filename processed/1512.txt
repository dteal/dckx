n horoscopes purport to predict someone's personality or future based on the position of planets and stars at the time of their birth and at present horoscopes commonly group people into twelve groups based on zodiac signs the names of the horoscope zodiac signs are based on the names of twelve constellations that were the backdrop for the path of the sun in the ancient times when the rules of settings horoscopes were originally developed today due to precession of the earth's axis of rotation and to a lesser degree due to the modern formal definitions of constellations the zodiac signs do not correspond fully to the names of actual constellations in the path of the sun one's zodiac sign is determined by the position of the sun on their birthday with each sign representing a specific 304 day period 1/12th of a year starting from the first point of aries modern science has found no basis for horoscopes which is why the comic jokes about the fact that its horoscopes at least may be true actual horoscopes are typically so vague that they could be true for almost anyone regardless of their sign note that this horoscope mainly makes sense for people living in the northern hemisphere as mentioned in the title text and it is especially tailored for an audience in the united states as most cultural references are centered on western or even specific american culture several won't even work in europe for example however with the principle understood it is easy to apply local traditions for more accuracy in non western cultures the 12 category zodiac signs in horoscopes are based on birth dates  the average length of pregnancy culturally considered to be nine months is actually given as the 40 weeks 92 months after the last menstrual period however what is relevant here is that it is only 38 weeks after conception 875 month the first two weeks of the 40 week period is before ovulation and the conception cannot occur before that based on this knowledge randall can do some informed guessing about the context of someone's conception apart from the obvious depending on the sign for example people of the sign virgo have been born between august 23 and september 22 this makes it most likely that they are conceived during december the year before given contemporary holiday music preferences christmas songs were likely to be playing the day they were conceived  this leads to the guess you may have been conceived while a christmas song played see detailed description of all the signs and explanation of the horoscopes in the table below randall phrases his predictions as possibilities you may have rather than declarations acknowledging that it is a guess and that it unlike actual horoscopes doesn't necessarily apply to everyone the title text refers to the coriolis effect which applies to a body that is moving relative to an object that is spinning since the earth is rotating a force the coriolis force causes moving objects to be deflected to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere this effect is the reason that weather systems most clearly seen for hurricanes spiral in one direction in the northern hemisphere and in the opposite direction in the southern hemisphere there is also a common misconception that the coriolis force in respect of the earth affects objects on a much smaller scale such as the direction water will spiral down a drain in the two hemispheres see also 843 misconceptions in reality the relative rotational speed of the earth one rotation per day is insufficient to affect anything but large scale relatively slow movement such as prevailing winds and ocean currents  randall plays on this type of misconception to make a joke involving reversing the flow of time so whereas babies are born nine months after conception in the northern hemisphere clockwise the coriolis effect is the reason why babies are being born nine months before in the southern hemisphere counterclockwise note that unlike these horoscopes which are declared to have an actual basis in fact it makes no sense for the conception of a baby to happen after its birth
