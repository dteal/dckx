n this comic pokes fun at the differing standard between image quality for television sets and electronic devices even though both are based on essentially the same standards when rating television sets a 1080p screen that is a screen 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels tall with progressive scan is considered impressive in contrast the same resolution with a computer device is considered standard fare given that on a 43 ratio computer screen 1024 pixels wide is expected widescreen monitors have already surpassed 1920 pixels wide and double widescreen monitors have become more common the title texts explains another disagreement involving images and popular opinion the feeling that a viewer gets from watching a film in a theatre is different from the feeling from a home film or again between a serialized programme from an international television channel and a locally broadcast programme the disparity is that the small time productions actually implement better quality equipment than the big time productions in terms of higher frame rate although not in image fidelity or other respects however the small productions really are cheaper in other respects and this feeling is transferred to the look of high frame rates thanks to videotapes often being used instead of film stock low frame rates on more big budget films and all old nostalgic productions before high frame rates were commercially possible mean low frame rates are associated with quality despite not being as able to capture as much motion as better quality high frame rates blur judder and slow pans are mostly absent in high frame rate productions this is changing however since the major films the hobbit and avatar 2 are/will be shot with better framerates
