n in this comic white hat is pointing out to cueball that his obsession with efficiency is inconsistent something that is likely true of many people who claim to prize efficiency here cueball raves about his new mobile keyboard which allows him to type 30% faster than his old keyboard he notes that people presumably himself particularly do a lot of mobile typing and a 30% reduction in the time that takes would allow more time for other activities white hat on the other hand mocks cueball for caring so much about mobile typing speed suggesting that this may not be the first time cueball has obsessed over minor improvements in efficiency white hat also notes that he's just seen cueball open and close google news five times without reading anything providing an example of how cueball's other actions do not embody the same commitment to efficiency that he claims to have cueball defends himself by saying that since he wastes so much time it's that much more important to improve efficiency in his life to make more time for important matters the title text presumably white hat's reply counters this defense by suggesting that cueball may be better off using a slower keyboard so that he will have less time to waste on stupid activities this type of argument may be an example of a logical fallacy argument which suggests perhaps incorrectly that cueball should spend less time doing stupid things to the extent that he spends longer doing things he already does interestingly in this comic white hat appears as the voice of reason to cueball an inversion of their typical dynamic see for instance 1386 people are stupid and 1459 documents the role reversal may be an acknowledgment that while cueball may often make a fool of white hat he's far from perfect himself randall's misadventures in time management are a recurring topic see 874 time management and the time management category mobile keyboard efficiency was previously tangentially referenced in 1068 swiftkey and randall's habit of opening news sites only to quickly get bored or distracted was shown in 1411 loop
