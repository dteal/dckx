n this comic is one of a series of my hobby comics here randall describes a hobby of confusing self righteous hybrid car drivers by creating situational irony there are many anecdotal instances of drivers of green vehicles both criticizing owners of less fuel efficient vehicles such as suvs and for taunting them about how much more they are paying for fuel randall is reversing this by taunting/criticizing the owner of a prius hybrid vehicle as though their roles were reversed the owner of the hybrid car is irritated and does not understand what is being said the title text rather than being a joke or additional punchline seems to be a serious opinion about how much more efficient electric vehicles are compared to gas powered vehicles; they would be a far superior form of transportation if only they weren't so expensive but an electric skateboard can only move a fraction of mass comparing to an suv
