n this comic depicts cueball on a rope in a cavern the text indicates that one of his loved ones used to be afraid of being taken away from him and being forgotten it is not explicitly made clear whether the loved one in question is a woman with whom he is in love a family member or a relation of some other kind but presumably the loved one is either his girlfriend or wife cueball had promised that he would always come looking for her but then she actually was taken from him he reiterates that he was serious about his promise and that he hopes she is not afraid because he's coming to find her it's not clear exactly in what manner his loved one was taken from him only that she was torn from his arms and vanished from this world though there are many other possible interpretations this might be read to indicate that she has died and that cueball is descending a cavern in search of the underworld where she has been taken it's also not completely clear whether cueball is descending the rope or climbing it the title text plays on a quote from the 1984 film the terminator in which kyle reese describes the terminator to sarah connor it can't be bargained with it can't be reasoned with it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop ever until you are dead the implication is that cueball motivated by love can't be persuaded to stop looking for his loved one by any means and that he will never stop looking until he finds her
