n megan picks up a strange device that mysteriously asks her to enter a query after stating loaded table people/ enter query in computer databases tables are groups of similar information consisting of records each having certain attributes databases are generally made up of many tables each containing different types of records a database for a traditional library might have a books table and a cardholders table with records of all of the books in the library and all of the people who have library cards each table will have different columns for certain attributes for every record for example the books table might have columns for title author date etc a request from a database by a user is called a query sql structured query language is a programming language designed for databases and has a certain syntax for its queries a common query is select which requests certain information from the database in the library example one might select in plain english all books written by a certain author or published after a certain date etc megan uses the device by entering an sql query into it select * from people where age &gt; 30 show all the people older than 30 it appears that the actual people around her who are over 30 are wrapped in a yellow light which does not apply to megan in this query megan then tries other experimental queries presumably to determine whether the results are correct first she queries for people with a high annual income a group that does not include her then for those who are afraid of flying which does include her because the results for herself are valid both times she then indulges her curiosity by asking who has watched porn in the preceding twelve hours this suggests that whatever database she is accessing is extremely thorough as it contains updated records of people's day to day activities the percentage of people lit appears to approximately correspond to real demographic data note 5 of the 10 characters are female; the median world/us age are fairly close to 30; top decile income in the usa is approximately $100000 and top earners are usually men; up to 40% of people are afraid of flying finally she types drop table people drop is an sql command to delete a table when she enters the command the entire table disappears and because she is also in this table she disappears too the implications are unclear it may be a suggestion that all of reality is a computer program all of the people are merely data in the program and megan was somehow granted access to the database for the program it could also be an allusion to the fact that human life is so rich diverse &amp; interesting but also extremely fragile someone who controls much power can simply with the press of a few buttons erase everything that thousands or millions of people had worked so hard on there is a subtle pun included here if we were to assume that the device physically contains the table people when megan tasks the device with dropping the table it not only causes the data table to be dropped but also the physical storage itself to be dropped the drop table command was also used in 327 exploits of a mom although with less fatal result the title text may suggest that when the people disappeared or died their records were moved to a table called ghosts the query would then presumably see all the people that were deleted in some implementations of databases deleted records are still hidden and remain until a ghost cleanup process removes the data permanently; the title text may also allude to this process alternatively the title text may refer to movies such as the sixth sense in which certain people are ghosts unbeknownst to those around them another quality that may be elucidated by megan's device
