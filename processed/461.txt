n google maps is a web mapping service application before smartphones with gps mapping software were widespread and most people's printers hadn't yet run out of ink it was common to print out directions to take with you on a trip the web version of google maps has many features including a route planner as sophisticated as early versions were it occasionally gave suboptimal directions for example the directions may tell you to take an exit that in reality is unmarked directions also did not take time of day into account which would help in planning routes to avoid traffic or to make use of services such as a ferry the title text tells us that cueball and his brother attempted to drive around the lake since they could not take the ferry and had an unfortunate run in with the straw man apparently waking him as the directions warned against though no specific game or movie is referenced steps 75 to 81 of the directions read like the plot of a horror film a guide of a video game or a role playing game a straw man is another term for scarecrow a common antagonist in both step 80 reads exactly like an old text adventure game's description of an area there are additional small jokes in the distance column of the directions  step 75 tells you to travel 1172 feet up a direction that google maps doesn't normally take into account no distance is traveled in step 77 so google instead tells you to be careful when talking to charlie pi is a ratio usually used in calculations involving circles rather than in measuring distances google doesn't know how far it is from the spectral wolf to your destination so it gives you question marks as the distance  this might be a reference to google maps' many easter eggs
