n the travelling salesman problem is a classic problem in computer science an intuitive way of stating this problem is that given a list of cities and their pairwise distances the task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and then returns to the origin city a naive solution solves the problem in on time where n is the size of the list simply by checking all possible routes and selecting the shortest one a more efficient dynamic programming approach yields a solution in on22n time these times are given using big o notation which is commonly used in computer science to show the efficiency or complexity of a solution or algorithm the joke is that the salesman selling online say on ebay amazon marketplace or other virtual marketplace does not have to worry about this problem since he does not need to travel to which the travelling salesman angrily responds shut the hell up the title text wonders about the time complexity of the cutting plane method which is sometimes used to solve optimization problems the last sentence suggests the down side for randall of writing comics about computer science; he sometimes encounters problems to which he cannot find the answer whereas authors of simpler comics such as garfield do not have this problem this is also likely a reference to 78 garfield which parodies garfield's simplicity the map almost certainly depicts the united states with the locations highlighted suspected to be from left to right seattle san francisco los angeles phoenix denver minneapolis dallas san antonio houston chicago cut off detroit atlanta miami washington dc philadelphia new york and boston this is so far the only comic featuring the brown hat character also see earlier strip 287 np complete
