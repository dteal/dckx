n the comic contrasts brilliant revolutionary scientific thought with the simplistic arrogance of assuming one understands the current scientific theory enough to correct it the character with the goatee has a degree in philosophy and perhaps has certain ideas of his own about how the world should fundamentally be described by physics he has studied einstein's theory of special relativity for less than an hour and thinks he has found a flaw when confronted about this he considers the objection as based in dogma and remains so confident that he wants to email the president of physics his ignorance of the field is emphasized by thinking that the entire field of physics has a president although certain important organizations such as the american physical society do have presidents cueball concedes that it is possible for such a revolutionary idea to come from a relative outsider one example is albert einstein's own formulation of special relativity which came while he was working at a patent office in switzerland although he did already have a phd in physics a thought experiment considers some hypothesis theory or principle for the purpose of thinking through its consequences the racecar on a train idea alludes to thought experiments involving frames of reference which are important in relativity special relativity was famously established using some thought experiments about moving objects however some searchers elaborated more complicated thought experiments and claimed they had proven relativity was self contradictory examples include twin paradox both twin is younger than the other until you stop assuming acceleration phases can be neglected or ladder paradox ladder is both smaller and larger than the garage until you consider seriously the problems with defining simultaneity for remote locations in relativity apparently the philosopher complicated einstein's train thought experiment by adding a racecar and found contradictions which prove special relativity is inconsistent however most likely scenario is that the racecar on a train is too complicated for goatee man to find correct conclusions a too complex case may be impossible to prove consistent with relativity using intuition alone complete solving involves calculation using lorentz transformations the title text is posing a question about the likelihood of two scenarios possibly to the person with the philosophy degree  that decades of work by numerous physicists is fundamentally incorrect and i found the flaw immediately that i need to read a little more  this might be a self referential title text as this question could be considered a simple thought experiment the philosopher should be able to overturn his theory using this simple thought experiment which reflects the second panel while his theory is not widely believed&#91;citation needed&#93; the joke is that the philosopher could overturn his first thought experiment racecar on train with this thought experiment randall hints that believing you have found fundamental flaws in a theory is much easier than doing more research on it this is possibly a statement about using occam's razor in arguments which says the simpler answer is the more likely one which is commonly brought up in philosophy usually when someone with little understanding of the subject thinks that they have found a flaw it takes only a little bit more reading to discover that the flaw is in fact completely explained already as an example lets say a high school student happens to do sqrt5 6 his calculator tells him 'error' and he thinks he has uncovered a function which has no answer in fact with a little more reading he would discover that mathematicians have a whole area devoted to this type of mathematics namely imaginary numbers
