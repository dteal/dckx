n cueball becomes introspective when contemplating the sea the straightforward reading of how small i really am means he feels humbled by the sea and recognizes his insignificance on this planet this is a common sentiment expressed in poetry literature and blogs the final line i should get one of those pumps is most likely to at first be understood as getting a pump to drain the ocean the reflection on the joke would run along the line that cueball is so unsatisfied with the way the ocean makes him feel the size of the sea intimidating him that he intends to drain the sea to make him feel better about himself this is of course impossible&#91;citation needed&#93; as the only place on earth that will hold all that water is the sea itself  however in english the sentences i'm small and i'm big can also be a euphemism for my penis is small and my penis is big even if cueball is not literally saying that he has a small penis men very commonly associate their own self image with the size of their organ therefore enlarging it would improve their self image and make them feel less small the final line in the comic i should get one of those pumps could thus be understood to reference a penis pump a device that is alleged to permanently increase the size of the male member&#91;citation needed&#93;  the title text is referencing that cueball would also like another pump and this one should be the one for draining the sea but by specifying in the title text that the first pump is not for the sea randall is ensuring that it is possible to understand the full joke
