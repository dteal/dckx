n a wind turbine uses wind to rotate its blades in order to generate electricity it is visually very similar to an electric fan which however does the exact opposite it uses electricity to rotate its blades in order to generate wind this opposition was previously highlighted in 1119 undoing the punchline of this comic is a pun on the other meaning of the word fan which qualifies someone as liking or supporting something here an idea megan suggests to have the turbine blow air at her so she could lift off with a kite something which would be conceivable with a huge fan but is impossible here precisely because the turbine is not a fan and therefore can't generate wind so the anthropomorphically speaking turbine's response is twofold 1 it's a turbine and not a huge fan which makes the idea impossible and 2 for this very reason it doesn't like the idea ie it is not a fan of the idea the title text alternatively suggests building a makeshift trebuchet a type of catapult the idea is that when the kite's string gets tangled in the turbine's blades the kite will be spun around and it will fling the attached rock this setup is more similar to a traction trebuchet than to the more common counterweight trebuchet
