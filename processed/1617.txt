n cueball is watching ponytail who has unearthed a time capsule that must have been buried in the ground many years ago a time capsule is a historic cache of goods or information usually intended as a method of communication with future people and to help future archaeologists anthropologists or historians however when she manages to open the capsule beret guy turns out to have been hiding inside while the capsule has been buried it turns out that he has mixed up the purpose of a time machine and a time capsule; when ponytail asks him where he came from he tells her the past i traveled here in this time machine he cannot explain how he got there but he claims that he could not have prevented it this is a reference to the fact that you cannot avoid being pushed forward through time see 1524 dimensions beret guy has also previously traveled to the future in a similar manner see 209 kayak beret guy claims he has been eating newspapers to survive; newspaper clippings are a stereotype content of time capsules he also managed to live underground in the time capsule which would typically be an airtight sealed box for what must be assumed to be at least several years although some time capsules are meant to be opened after just a few years 10 or 25 years for instance the plan should be that it is not opened for at least several years after it is created so this comic is one more example of the strange powers of beret guy ie living by eating paper and without breathing oxygen but he has before displayed patience enough to sit still for five years in 1088 five years beret guy mentions he got inside his time machine to attempt an assassination of adolf hitler using the hammer he is holding traveling to the past in a time machine to assassinate hitler is a common trope in speculative fiction as a way to try to prevent the second world war however the scheme only works via travel into the past to some time before hitler rose to power and started the war rather than into the future as beret guy did of course when beret guy entered the time machine hitler may still have been alive if it was realized early enough what kind of threat hitler was posing a plan could have been devised where beret guys traveled to a future time where it would become possible to kill hitler and where it would still make a difference if he did however it would have been more practical to just wait though beret guy is never practical since he did not travel into the past but forward in time by letting time pass normally and since he did not get out until long after hitler's demise ponytail can tell him that hitler has been dead for a long time 70 years at the time of the comic's release so if the capsule was opened on the day of the release of the comic then he was 70 years too late but of course the comic could be set at any time after the war also in the future as long as it would make sense to say that hitler died long ago the fact that hitler is already dead does not bother beret guy on the contrary he is pleased as he just realizes his job has already been done what he thus fails to realize is that he was probably supposed to kill hitler before he got the second world war started this was the same type of failure made by black hat in 1063 kill hitler black hat did actually travel 67 years back in time and killed hitler sadly it was in the last days of the war in 1945 just before hitler would have died anyway so it had no effect on history either and the time machine was a one shot thing when he finds out that his job is done he asks ponytail if they should get some sandwiches it is a known feature of beret guy that he likes bakers and bread though not specifically sandwiches realizing he is in the future he suddenly becomes aware that this concept may have been forgotten and he asks if they still exist in this future this is a reference to another comic where megan has traveled through time in the same way as beret guy; see 630 time travel it may also be a reference to the new version of star trek in which scotty's response to learning someone is from the future is do they still have sandwiches there in the title text beret guy becomes afraid that he will now disappear because he has changed the future in a way so he would no longer exist a typical example would be to go back and kill your parents before you were born or just prevent them from falling in love as in the movie back to the future this creates a paradox where you will never be born and thus cease to exist of course the paradox is that you could thus not have prevented your birth in the first place if you did not already exist  another good example of how this might feel is displayed in the movie timecop however it turns out that in beret guy's case it was only his sight that was disappearing and that was only because his beret had fallen over his eyes in any case the fear is baseless since he only traveled forward in time not backwards and thus could not have changed his own past time machines have been referenced in many xkcd comics see the time travel category
