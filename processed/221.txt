n the comic specifies a function in a c like syntax which judging by its name should be designed to return a random number most functions of this form are random number generators meaning that on subsequent calls they return different random numbers but the programmer has instead implemented a function that just returns always the same random number; which while it could indeed have been truly randomly chosen by rolling a dice as the comment documented is essentially worthless were it ever to be called more than once with the expectation of different ie random results  in other words the results over time would not be random at all but completely predictable and deterministic the ieee is the organization responsible for maintaining a number of computer standards an rfc or request for comments is a formal document put out to computing experts by ietf in the hopes of becoming a future standard however rfc 1149 was an april fools' joke defining how carrier pigeons can be used to transmit internet packets rfc 11495 meanwhile simply does not exist
