n this comic makes fun of the artificially dramatized and simplified depiction of science in movies the unstated premise seems to be that the scientists are trying to get information about a murderer based on a sample obtained from his clothing the movie version of events involves the two scientists cueball and ponytail doing exciting things with a control console lab rats a device with some kind of beam perhaps a laser and a complicated chemical apparatus the scientists quickly arrive at the firm conclusion that paint on the clothes is from an antimatter factory in belgrade serbia  while not directly used in the study a newton's cradle in motion can be seen in the first panel a device notoriously useless in any serious scientific study but very often used in movies for instance as a prop in the office of a professor there is also a hamster wheel according to the official transcript it is a hamster ball but it is clearly not a ball as it has spokes and thus resembles a hamster running wheel probably for the rats shown in the next panel the actual science version shows the same scientists putting a sample into a device likely a mass spectrometer or a centrifuge the device apparently takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes to analyze the sample according to the clock on the wall moving from 1005 to 1125 at the end of this process the only thing learned is that there is probably no barium or radium in the sample this conclusion is not very helpful on its own and is not even very certain there are several major concepts about science and technology that movies tend to distort for the purposes of a more exciting plot both illustrated here one is that the work involves a lot of different exciting looking gadgets another is that the analysis can be done very quickly and results in very certain and significant conclusions besides this the scientists often seem to have access to a database full of trivial information from around the world in reality a scientific analysis of some sample or data often only requires a single boring looking machine takes quite some time and provides a limited result that must be interpreted very carefully to have any meaning at all the title text further illustrates a movie science scene depicting someone deducing the presence of nanobots simply by observing the behavior of a perturbed lab rat the helvetica scenario is a fictional experiment presented in switzerland helvetica is the latin name for the country which assumes that removing only the nucleus the center of an atom of a calcium molecule in one's skin but still leaving the electron shell at its position would cause a massive reaction ending up in heavy mutations the helvetica scenario was made up by the bbc comedy show look around you in the pilot episode which can be seen here at 610 code grey may refer to grey goo a hypothetical doomsday scenario involving nanobots in 1242 scary names grey goo is on the chart and the helvetica scenario is mentioned in the title text antimatter is also referenced in 826 guest week zach weiner smbc  1621 fixion and 1731 wrong as well as being the subject of the what if antimatter it was also mentioned in another what if lake tea
