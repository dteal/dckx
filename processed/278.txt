n this strip portrays black hat providing support for linux but in fact he provides only annoying and unhelpful advice just for his own personal amusement the support line is clearly for linux as stated in the introduction and the client on the phone clearly has a linux problem however black hat is intentionally giving irrelevant instructions that refer to the windows os start menu my documents folder finally black hat asks the client on the phone to bear with him and suggests that the client should use a highly obsolete mechanism to look for the answer to his problem namely aol keywords aol is well known for producing one of the earlier online communities and has since fallen largely out of favor the client hangs up the phone the title text mentions the function select which allows you to write asynchronous io access routines by checking if it is ready to be read/written to at a specific moment this is different than a threaded model in that it can happen in a single thread the danger of such programming is that if you do not coordinate the reader/writer properly you can create a dead lock which can result in the consumption of a lot of resources
