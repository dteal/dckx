n the magic school bus is a series of educational children's books in the us that was adapted in the mid nineties into an animated television show the series centers on a class of children whose teacher ms frizzle makes use of the titular magic school bus to take her students on a variety of magical field trips that allow them to experience various scientific topics first hand such as the inner anatomy of the human body the effects of friction what goes on inside a beehive and many others in this comic however ms frizzle initially takes the students onto the bus apparently for one of these field trips to explore the way batteries work but then for whatever reason she has the students get off the bus again and simply resorts to looking up the wikipedia article about batteries the implied joke is that with the advent on resources like wikipedia it's no longer necessary for ms frizzle to take the students on half hour long trips in the bus to experience whatever phenomenon they are studying that day which is what the third panel symbolizes wikipedia effectively answers the question quickly and easily an alternative answer is that ms frizzle has just gotten lazy and has resorted to looking up the answers to the students' questions on wikipedia instead of taking them on field trips the alternative seems more likely since the third panel shows them still going on an adventure however briefly it takes to get to the library/computer lab the red and white cubed rocket in the bottom of the third panel can possibly be a reference to the adventures of tintin in which tintin goes to the moon in a rocket that is similar if not identical to the one depicted the child who is asking the question looks similar to wanda one of the regular students in the class who often asked the questions that set the field trips in motion ralphie the student in the second panel with the backward hat was another student who often asked these questions the students in the class were shown to be from many backgrounds ie some of the students were black another was asian etc something randall appears not to have added into this comic despite it being in color the title text is a reference to phoebe one of the students in ms frizzle's class who would regularly make a remark beginning with at my old school phoebe used to go to a different school unlike many of the other students in the class to express wonder at how unusual were the events of ms frizzle's field trips eg at my old school we never rode on bees phoebe actually said that so much that in an episode where she goes back to her old school the sign out front labels it as phoebe's old school microsoft encarta 2005 was a digital encyclopedia that was often used in school settings for learning with the aid of computers arguably with the advent of wikipedia programs like encarta have become relatively less widely used which is part of the joke in the title text
