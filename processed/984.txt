n sls which stands for space launch system is the new launch program being designed by nasa to replace the retired space shuttle launch system in the first frame cueball is showing black hat something about the sls possibly a video on his phone or other portable electronic device as usual with his appearances black hat is causing trouble here black hat would appear to be telling the truth because nazi scientists like wernher von braun who was one of the developers of the saturn v launch vehicle came over to america from germany and helped develop nasa's space program black hat's assumption in the last frame is obviously a bridge too far which is where the joke is in the comic but he gets his desired reaction out of cueball who is hanging his head or staring him down  randall has left no details to distinguish first he makes it clear that the lesson is that you should put the nazis in charge and we saw from world war two what that could lead to then when cueball thinks this is a terrible lesson he puts salt in to his wound by suggesting that the only way find a better lesson it to ask a nazi for a better one a consistent move if you apply his lesson but a logic bomb because he suggests to put a nazi in charge of finding another lesson than put a nazi in charge shania twain comes into this comic in the title text because in her song that don't impress me much she sings okay so you're a rocket scientist / that don't impress me much but the title text argues that if she stood under the new sls prototype she would admit it was in fact impressive and it is thus the sls head engineers plan to invite shania to do just that although he could still understand if she did not wish to date him but he would be surprised if she was still unimpressed
