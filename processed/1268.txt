n randall is trying to make the point that eating lobsters is as weird as eating spiders crustaceans and arachnids are both arthropods members of the same phylum so his comparison isn't too far off then again humans are in the same phylum chordates as sea squirts so any perceived similarities are not exactly rooted in a close biological relationship in addition lobsters were once considered the cockroaches of the sea and a captain trying to feed his crew with lobster would often be seen as cruel on the other side cooked tarantula spiders are considered a delicacy in cambodia earth prime means the original earth in a multiverse a multitude of universes earth prime is typically the earth on which the narrative begins simply out of convenience the title text also references changing clocks to and from daylight saving time dst which randall has made clear he is not a fan of and he has made fun of it in several comics randall thinks he originally came from another earth earth prime to our earth in the late 1990s so he had been here for about 15 years at the time of this comic in 2013 earth prime only differs from the earth where he currently lives together with the rest of us on the lobster thing and then also on dst where some of you occasionally change your clocks for some reason the reason seems to elude randall though the use of earth prime and the mention of the late 1990s suggest that randall may be referring to the tv show sliders which aired around that time which was about a group of people who randomly slid between alternate universes
