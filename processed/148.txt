n this is the sixth comic at the my hobby series cueball is deliberately mispronouncing words while talking it's just his hobby hobbies in the my hobby series are generally annoying or weird but with an element of cleverness here cueball persists in mispronouncing his words despite the second character's attempt to correct him in the title text randall explains that he got the idea for this comic from one of his friends interestingly when randall started the xkcd blog in october 2006 6 weeks after the publication of this comic he named it blag and has used that name in several other comics such as 181 interblag and 239 blagofaire
