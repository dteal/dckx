n megan announces that there's a compulsive phone checking championship presumably an award for the person who checks his or her phone the most often megan checks her phone to see if the winner has been announced but finds the site's server is overloaded which would be exactly what would happen if many people were checking their phones simultaneously given the nature of the contest we can presume this is indeed the case as a solution megan tries refreshing repeatedly sending more load to the server and thus making it unavailable longer this is a symptom of ocd this compulsive behavior predates the popularity of mobile phones as shown in 477 typewriter and 862 let go another possible analysis is that the site was purposely down and instead was the contest itself to see how many times different users would refresh the page within a time period or perhaps to the last one standing determining the winner the title text implies that megan checks her phone so compulsively she even does it in her sleep this probably contributed to her victory a webite is probably either a typo of website or a pinned tab in a web browser
