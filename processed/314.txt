n  megan is upset because she is apparently older than 26 and among people who marry half do so below 26 the intuitive conclusion is that the number of potential partners is decreasing as time goes on the half plus seven rule is an unwritten rule which asserts that it is creepy to date anyone who is younger than half your age plus 7 years for example a 50 year old dating someone who is 31 or younger would be classed as creepy as the graph on the right shows there is a lower limit and an upper limit  the lower limit defines the minimum age of your partner in order that you are not considered creepy the upper limit defines the maximum age of your partner in order that they are not considered creepy  as age increases they age range of potential non creepy partners widens at 26 the range of non creepy partners is 18 years 20 to 38 year olds at 50 it is a range of 54 years 32 to 86 years old at age 14 you can only date people your own age the same also works with infinity but even methuselah died once while the application of this rule actually reduces the number of potential matches further cueball presents it in a positive way by showing that there are whole swathes of people who she couldn't marry in the first place without being in a creepy relationship and that as her age increases the range of non creepy partners increases combined with census bureau data cueball shows that her eligible dating pool is in fact still increasing megan notes that graph making nerds like cueball may have a hard time finding dates but this is belied by the title text
