n cueball searches google to find out where birds go when it rains he finds that the question is asked worldwide across many different languages and websites a variety of screenshots are shown of different websites and forums where users have asked where birds go when it rains with at least nine languages shown the bottom of this panel fades to white suggesting that the occurrence of these questions stretches on and on cueball expresses delight at the idea that this question is the one to which everyone wants to know the answer; worrying about birds getting wet is the thing that unites us later in the comic a bird in the rain is also searching on the internet for where birds go when it rains this is humorously implying that a significant set of these questions are being typed by birds looking for a dry place after being caught in the rain and not humans this makes cueball wrong; worrying about birds getting wet does not unite us in reality as the comic states birds look for shelter so they can stay dry on a rainy day you can usually find birds in leafy trees caves or other kinds of cover in the superman comics clark kent is superman so you never observe both clark kent and superman simultaneously by analogy the title text whimsically suggests that a possible inference from the observation that you never see birds and rain together is that birds are the rain perhaps birds are an unknown phase of water in addition to its familiar phases of ice vapor and liquid water water has more exotic phases such as low temperature and high pressure ices and supercritical gases; why not birds the title text imbues the question with more philosophical significance than it warrants prompted perhaps by cueball's earlier hyperbole and points up the irrationality of the implication that a question must be deep simply because a lot of people ask it and that such questions demand a complex radical answer
