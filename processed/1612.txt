n the typical symptoms of a cold are a sore throat blocked or runny nose sneezing and coughing slightly less common symptoms can include headache aching muscles and an unpleasant sensation of temperature the earlier symptoms to occur following infection are generally the more unpleasant feeling symptoms headache aching muscles sneezing and feeling cold however these symptoms are also those which are least obvious to other people and so elicit very little sympathy within a few days these symptoms start to subside while a cough and runny nose start these symptoms generally feel less unpleasant but are much more noticeable to others and so more sympathy may be given the cough may lead to a hoarse voice making the patient sound very ill; ironically at this point it may be easier for an employed person to phone in sick but it is less desirable to stay off work but it is now when the patient sounds hoarse that others give the sympathy that was really needed when the patient was feeling awful during the first couple of days and to randall this is the worst about colds that the patients first gets sympathy when it is no longer really needed the graph shows the above mentioned facts as two curves one that indicates how bad the sickness is really bad on day 2 but much better already on day 3 and the other curve how bad the patient sounds due to the hoarseness and the coughing and this curve first peaks around day 4 6 when the sympathy is no longer needed the symptoms of the two periods are listed below the curves indicating which periods are affected by them in the title text randall muses about the fact that contagiousness ends around the time when hoarseness begins this is the time when employers ask sick employees to stay at home in bed when they call in to the office because they sound so hoarse and also the time when coworkers will stay clear of those who do come in but then it is too late since everyone is probably already infected by then randall thus suggests that this is evidence that the cold virus has evolved to spread optimally in a work place since the cold virus is much older than offices this is unlikely but it will always spread better in places where many people are close together; and since we are more inside in the winter this is the main reason why it spreads more during cold periods however viruses do evolve very quickly so it may not be unlikely that some of them has already adapted to our present way of living another thing that randall doesn't like about cold is that no medicine works and the one that relives you the most is hard to come by this was the subject two weeks later in 1618 cold medicine and this suggests that it is actually randall himself who has a long lasting cold
