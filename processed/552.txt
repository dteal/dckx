n this comic focuses on the apparent difficulty people have in understanding the difference between correlation and causation when two variables like blood cholesterol levels and heart disease are positively correlated it means that as one variable increases so does the other whereas a negative correlation means that as one variable increases the other decreases the human brain is very good at seeing patterns and deducing rules and the seemingly natural conclusion is that that the one is leading to the other in the example that high blood cholesterol causes heart disease this may well be true  the positive correlation is certainly not an argument against such a conclusion  but it is only one type of evidence and is certainly not proof the relationship between diet and blood chemistry and heart disease is a complex one but simpler examples abound  for example if you tallied the sales of sunglasses and incidence of skin cancer by region you would probably find that there is a high positive correlation  that is in locations where many people buy sunglasses there are also many cases of skin cancer here it would seem silly to believe that wearing sunglasses can cause skin cancer but this is exactly the same thinking that allowed us to conclude that blood cholesterol causes heart disease  correlations do have the ability to mislead us   in this example both sunglasses and skin cancer are directly affected by a third factor specifically a climate where many people expose themselves to the sun in essence when two variables are correlated it does not provide evidence that one variable has caused the other all it says is that their trends move in relation to each other the correlation could be due to causality but it could equally be due to other factors or it could even be a random result in this situation cueball is explaining to megan his realization that correlation is not the same thing as causation he further explains that his belief changed some time after taking a statistics class megan concludes that the course caused his realization thereby establishing a causation cueball's final response of well maybe is a self referential joke as there is not enough information to establish causation only correlation which the class supposedly would have taught him being taught something in an academic setting does not necessarily mean a person will readily understand/realize the concept hence the lack of absolute causation it could also be a joke on megan's behalf cueball may know whether his new knowledge is caused by the course but he points out that megan can't be certain about the causation the title text plays on two meanings of the word imply have as consequence or insinuate in the statement correlation does not imply causation correlation is here seen as a person giving you subtle hints where to look for the cause this is a metaphor for research where the correlation must be investigated further perhaps in a wider scope or with the consideration of more variables so that the reason for it is understood for example barry marshall and robin warren noticed that the presence of helicobacter pylori was highly correlated with duodenal ulcer patients  they investigated further  result  the nobel prize in medicine in addition the title text's reference to waggling eyebrows and gesturing furtively while mouthing look over there is clearly a reference to the movie ferris bueller's day off in which the character of cameron frye tries to alert ferris that ferris's father is in the next cab over and they are about to be discovered ditching school what randall is saying with this reference is that correlation if it were a character in a movie is desperately trying to draw attention to causation without openly stating this intention and perhaps that correlation is a good place to start when looking for causation
