n       this explanation may be incomplete or incorrect  explanation can be scaled back to mention that closed loop and time paradoxes are not real since time travelers can predict outcome of conversation that may never take placeif you can address this issue please edit the page thanks cueball has apparently been reading about time travel he tells megan about this and megan excitedly remarks that she did her college thesis on time travel which basically means that she is supposed to know a lot more about time travel than a guy who has just been reading about it cueball however continues to ask her if she knows basic facts about time travel like he is investigating if he has discovered facets about it that she would have overlooked while writing a thesis about it megan keeps trying to say that since she wrote a time travel thesis hence the title of the comic she already knows all of this and much much more and she is obviously getting frustrated by cueball's attempts to impress her with his knowledge  at this point megan's future self arrives with a bzzzzt having used time travel to arrive at this exact moment in time it seem she has continued her research and has successfully managed to make a time machine the reason she arrives is only to tell her younger self that this conversation with cueball doesn't go anywhere and isn't important and so present megan can leave and not waste her time anymore up till then megan was presumably reluctant to break off a conversation on the topic of time travel since the conversation could potentially have improved or maybe she was even at first attracted to cueball and interested because he at least had read about time travel but once the conversation began to run off track it came as a relief to know that she could quit without the risk of missing out on anything important also since megan took the effort to time travel back to this exact moment that must mean the conversation was so boring and uneventful she kept regretting having this conversation even far into the future to the point where she remembers it as one of the moments that need to be changed with her acquired time travel abilities and then she just walks away with her future self leaving cueball hanging in the last panel having invented a completely new way to get out of useless/boring conversations alternatively future megan just makes an excuse to haul present megan off in order to prevent the latter from disclosing some details of time travel science to cueball which could have unintended consequences however using very advanced technology or even violating physics law for very mundane ends is very common in xkcd so using time travel to prevent useless conversation is not surprising from megan in either case future megan finished this conversation before inventing time travel and thus knows this conversation's outcome so by coming back she now changes her own and cueball's future of course the general implications of being able to travel like this are enormous and the paradoxes arising from such a possibility are endless the most pressing at the moment being the grandfather paradox where a time traveler creates circumstances that negate their existence such as killing their own grandfather in this case older meagan going back in time to stop younger megan from finishing this conversation who will eventually become older megan but with no reason to go back to tell younger megan to stop this boring conversation it is worth noting however that the comic does not inherently cause a paradox so long as the megan who didn't finish the conversation stills travels back in time with the knowledge that the conversation needed to be stopped and still saves her younger self from wasting her time a time loop can be logically sustained it is also worth noting that a mobius time loop is also perfectly possible the grandfather paradox isn't a paradox if quantum entanglement is taken into account something megan would no doubt know it is possible that randall may have had some conversations like this where after having spent a lot of time getting nothing out of it himself would have wished his future self had come back to tell him to just leave the conversation now in the title text present megan asks future megan about her futuristic googles and what they are for presumably assuming they are needed for the time travel maybe it is the backpack however it turns out it's just some old and broken google glass the only reason future megan wears these is that she attended a party at the club that had a 2010's night theme it seems generally that randall is no fan of google glass which was also shown earlier in 1251 anti glass and later again in 1304 glass trolling google glass has become a recurring theme in xkcd this is an indication of how far from the future she has traveled as google glass was first released in the 2010s it is not clear whether she is wearing google glass because it became popular in the 2010s or because it was an esoteric piece of hardware that people would readily associate with the 2010s also a 90s party may be thrown today but not a 2000s party so it is safe to assume that megan is at least from the 2030s also people attending retro dress up parties frequently make mistakes and do not dress up exactly in style creating some anachronisms especially if they dress up like they did many years ago
