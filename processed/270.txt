n merlin is a wizard who features prominently in various retelling of the legend of king arthur the once and future king by author t h white is one of the most popular versions of the legend and in it merlin is described as living backwards through time as cueball and megan discuss in this comic this is also briefly mentioned in the musical camelot which is based on this version of the story  in the comic cueball is speculating philosophically on how this would have affected merlin's life as he started life with all his memories and gradually lost them comparing this to cueball's own sense of unreality at goodbyes  many old people do however end up alone without friends or family and they may do nothing but watch tv all day they might also lose their memory so in this respect merlin's last days may not be so different from many real peoples except of course that merlin was supposed to live in the late 5th and early 6th centuries with no access to dvd or even tv  memento is a movie telling the main parts of its story backwards while a few black and white scenes are straightforward so when merlin watches the movie he sees nearly the whole story in its actual order and the title text drives home the joke by noting that these few scenes that make sense to someone with normal perceptions would make less sense to him normal old people would not be able to enjoy memento like merlin although he would of course always have remembered seeing it when he got old until the day he saw it and then forgot it afterwards plot hole of the comic
