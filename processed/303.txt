n computer programming involves writing instructions for a computer to follow in a specific programming language which is largely human readable and writable at least to programmers who understand that language  however for the computers to follow instructions they need to be given machine code xe2x80x94 the actual language that computers speak and one that can be written directly with the correct tools but would be too tedious and error prone for just about any practical modern project where alternatives exist where anything more than a hello world could be awkward to implement straight into machine code conversion from the more conveniently human writable code into computer executable files is performed by interpreters or compilers  interpreters eg that for php for one example generally read through the code or script each line at a time as and when required and has to do a lot of work with various processing overheads and the risk of hitting an invalid instruction or mistake in syntax that it can't handle  it also requires that a relevant version of the interpreter exist on any machine that has to run the script and perhaps some additional knowledge by the end user for widely distributed and especially commercial programs some form of compilation will instead be used  compiling may have just one computer system read through the man written code and barring errors produces the equivalent stand alone and direct machine readable code suitable for a given range of computers  this process might involve several passes to check for 'obvious' errors in the code as well as converting some programming concepts that are easiest for humans to understand into equivalent concepts that may be far easier for the computer to work with as such compiling takes a certain amount of time at the time of production  depending on the size of the project and the power of the computer doing the compilation it may measure in hours but at least only needs to be repeated if an untrapped error needs fixing or additional features added in at a later date  as of 2015 the linux kernel contains over 19 million lines of code arguably a massive job for any compiler but if done correctly it saves time for all the people who will ultimately be using its output thus when cueball is caught wasting time at work he argues that such activities are not worse than any other possible ones at this moment  if his job is writing code and compiling it then there may be nothing else that he can do right now  he cannot usefully tweak the code before it finishes compiling and the expected result checked the title text takes this a step further  cueball claims that all activities are equally benign while the code is compiling xe2x80x94 and that includes committing illegal acts such as stealing lcds
