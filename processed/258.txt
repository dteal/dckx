n a conspiracy theory purports to explain a social political or economic event as being caused or covered up by a covert group or organization a typical example is the moon landing conspiracy which asserts that no human has ever reached the moon once a conspiracy theory starts it often grows stronger facts agreeing with the theory are of course evidence for the theory facts disagreeing with the theory are considered part of the cover up and thus prove there is in fact a cover up so they're also evidence for the theory in the moon landing case videos of men walking on the moon are assumed to be faked by hollywood studios so the existence of the assumed fake videos proves the cover up also the absence of filming crew or anything else needed for faking a video is considered further proof of how carefully the cover up was planned no matter what happens next it will be evidence for the conspiracy theory  people promoting these theories belong to a small minority but they gain attention by many people xe2x80x94 often without much knowledge on that specific matter people who have actual knowledge about a given subject just get frustrated by this because it seems like smart or educated people should reject conspiracy theories for lack of proof in the comic hairy who is considered smart by cueball starts pointing out errors in the official 9/11 story obviously starting to describe the 9/11 conspiracy theory cueball cuts his speech sharply and his heart is broken because he's seeing his smart friend wasting his great intelligence in a foolish conspiracy theory instead of doing something useful in the second panel cueball rants about conspiracy theories in general he mentions young earth creationism the moon landing and perpetual motion machines in the third panel hairy mentions that of course we never landed on the moon this frustrates cueball so much that he just walks away with no further comment in the last panel cueball asks god to fix the bug he committed when creating smart beings capable of believing such foolish things as conspiracy theories this is a not so subtle joke as to atheists god himself is quite similar to a conspiracy theory indeed a good portion of evidence against god's existence put forward by an atheist is met with a whatever happens it's god's will by believers' side this is much like any other conspiracy theory so in this last panel cueball is pictured as contradicting himself by complaining that other people believe in foolish conspiracy theories when he himself is very plainly believing his own foolish conspiracy theory of course from the believers' perspective atheism also has many characteristics of a conspiracy theory in particular atheism and agnosticism are a small subculture xe2x80x94 actually smaller in the us than the 9/11 truth movement xe2x80x94 that thinks a large majority of people about 95% of americans believe in god have been deluded into believing something ridiculous by conspiracies ie churches and conservative politicians that benefit from spreading misinformation on the subject some atheists are rational in that they take evidence against this position seriously and adjust their beliefs to fit all the facts but some are quite willing to make claims that have been decisively refuted a bug report is a description of some error that occurred when using a computer program to inform the developer of a problem that needs to be fixed filing a bug report to god should be unnecessary as god is generally understood by believers to be omniscient and thus already aware of the problem and presumably be allowing it to exist for explicable reasons of god's will  the title text refers the large number of educated people who believe in young earth creationism stating that the earth is only thousands of years old instead of the billions of years evolutionary scientists suggest
