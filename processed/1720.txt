n the programming of self driving cars has been in the news lately as engineers and philosophers debate what rules the cars should follow in dangerous situations for instance what to do when forced to choose between hitting a pedestrian or swerving into oncoming traffic randall in the form of ponytail suggests one approach for solving this problem to think of the car as behaving like a horse using its own intelligence and ignoring dangerous commands in the interests of self preservation the comic begins with ponytail claiming that in the old days riding a horse or driving a horse drawn vehicle while drunk was less dangerous than drunk driving today given the higher speed and the denser traffic today this might seem plausible  on the other hand modern cars have seat belts airbags and other features designed to save lives when crashes do occur; horses and horse drawn vehicles lacked these safety features but if you do fall asleep the horse will not suddenly walk into another oncoming horse and may actually just stop walking while you sleep ponytail expands the argument by stating the horse itself will be acting in the interest of its own self preservation she finally states that in a comparison of the ability of self driving cars we should forget humans and instead it should be the ability of horses that should be the benchmark that the self driving cars should be judged against this segues into a scene with white hat bragging to cueball and megan about the features of a car in order to sell the car to them appealing to the horse explanation that ponytail gave to randall in order to get them to buy the car by comparing the features to those of horses car engines are traditionally measured in horsepower which roughly compares the power output of the engine to that of a horse white hat goes a step further claiming he can measure the car's onboard computer's driving abilities in the equivalent number of horses comparing the car's ability to mitigate for a drunk driver and/or avoid obstacles to that of a horse white hat has been depicted as a salesman before in 1350 lorenz and similarly earlier in 260 the glass necklace the title text features more comparisons of the car to horses apparently the car has 240% of a horse's decision making ability while producing only 30% as much poop so even with 35 horse intelligence it may only have 24 times the decision making ability assuming it's the same car a cars poop would be its exhaust which is usually not found on the road in the form of solid waste but could still nonetheless be measured as it contains mass  while no source is stated for the 30% ratio the point that cars are less polluting than horses is surprisingly valid when regarding waste left in the street before the invention of the automobile city streets were commonly filled with horse manure of course the amount of pollution created by the cars of the world makes them much more toxic both for humans breathing the exhaust fumes and on the larger scale with the climate then again if there where a horse for each horsepower in all the cars then that would also be a problem with the release of methane gas etc note that riding a horse while drunk is in fact still dangerous and illegal in many places for example the uk and ireland a badly driven horse can throw off its owner trample passersby fall on bad surfaces and destroy any wagon or carriage it's pulling a self driving car should be able to understand road rules which a horse will not which is presumably why the cars in the comic and the title text are both specified as being more intelligent than a horse in 887 future timeline dogs driving cars are mentioned self driving cars is a recurring topic on xkcd in 1461 payloads spacecraft mass is measured in horses
