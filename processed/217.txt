n e is a mathematical constant roughly equal to 271828182846 xcfx80 is another roughly equal to 314159265359 both are transcendental numbers the first panel discusses excfx80 xcfx80 which is around 19999099979 xe2x80x94 very close to 20  black hat explains how he tricked a programming team into believing that excfx80 xcfx80 is close enough to 20 that the computer should be unable to tell the difference and that any noticeable deviation from 20 results from errors in the code this made them waste a lot of time trying to find a nonexistent bug until they realized that black hat was lying clearly they had not known him for very long floating point numbers are how computers store non integer real numbers as decimals xe2x80x94 or rather in most cases approximate them infinite amounts of data would be required to represent most numbers in decimal form exceptions are whole numbers and terminating decimals the floating point handlers would be the code performing the excfx80 xcfx80 calculation acm is the association for computing machinery sponsoring the international collegiate programming contest some random facts about the math here   excfx80 xcfx80 is an irrational number but this is not a trivial fact it was proven by yuri valentinovich nesterenko in the late 20th century  the mysterious almost equation is believed to be a mathematical coincidence or a numerical relationship that just happens with no satisfactory explanation it can be rearranged to xcfx80 + 20i xe2x89x881 so coslnxcfx80 + 20 xe2x89x881 piling on a few more cosines gives cosxcfx80 cosxcfx80 coslnxcfx80 + 20 xe2x89x881 which is off by less than 10xe2x88x9235  the title text pokes fun at another coincidence xe2x88x9c9xc2xb2 + 19xc2xb2/22 xe2x89x88 31415926525 close to xcfx80 deviating only in the 9th decimal place the humor comes from the fact that xcfx80 is transcendental transcendental numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed through basic arithmetic with integers; one cannot end up with the exact value for any transcendental number including xcfx80 by adding subtracting multiplying dividing exponentiating and/or taking the nth root of any whole number meaning the title text cannot possibly be true a much later comic 1047 approximations puts forth quite a few more mathematical coincidences
