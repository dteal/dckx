n this comic was published 2 months after randall's then fiancxc3xa9e now wife was diagnosed with breast cancer see categorycancer which is likely what inspired this comic even though cueball sounds like he is the one afflicted by the sickness the comic is thus about the existential questions that might arise from such a crisis the moral could be interpreted as that you shouldn't begrudge your fellow human being regardless of where they find comfort also any sentence is instantly funny if at the end of it you address your audience as bitches&#91;citation needed&#93; it may also be a reference to 54 science slings and arrows of fortune is an allusion to the to be or not to be soliloquy in william shakespeare's hamlet prince of denmark hamlet asks himself whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer / the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune to resign oneself to one's fate and endure what may come or to take arms against a sea of troubles / and by opposing end them to commit suicide and end suffering; he ultimately concludes that we would rather face the dangers and pains we know on earth than whatever unknown new ones may come in the afterlife cueball appears to agree with hamlet thanking the people who refused to gracefully accept the ineffability of reality religion and spirituality can give him the moral courage to face his death but he'd much prefer to not die in the first place and won't have to thanks to medical and scientific innovation the title text is a pun based on cueball's newfound confidence asserting that his statement because they work bitches has a 95% confidence interval
