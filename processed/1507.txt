n in the first two panels of this game megan kicks a football also known as a soccer ball in some regions but the surprise comes in the next panel when it turns out she tried to kick it into a basketball hoop where cueball is either trying to catch stop or dunk the ball hairbun is also reaching an arm up after the ball but then ponytail yells out when megan asks ponytail why the ball is out ponytail explains it is due to the infield fly rule that was invoked when the ball crossed into the baseball zone a very complicated rule to understand for baseball outsiders they are playing a ball game that incorporates the rules of many games that use a ball the rules seem to be based on the location of the ball ponytail is holding a map which divides the area into zones each time the ball enters a new zone the rules change to become the rules of the ball game represented in that zone the name metaball is the combination of the prefix meta and the word ball there was a previous comic with meta in the title 1447 meta analysis then there is the joke is meta in 917 hofstadter megan is out according to the rules of baseball because the football that she initially kicked in the football zone in an attempt to score in the basketball hoop in the basketball zone clipped the corner of the baseball zone and suddenly her high kick turned into a pop fly and ponytail presumably the referee and creator/ruler of this game invoked the infield fly rule which forces the batter out in this case that would be the kicker megan as she is the last to have touched the ball in baseball the infield fly rule can be invoked by the umpire ie the referee in baseball ponytail in this case to prevent an infielder from intentionally dropping a fair ball when runners are on multiple bases forcing the runners on base to advance and allowing the infielder's team to quickly perform a double or triple play by throwing the ball to where the runners are trying to get and performing force out on their base the infield fly rule once called out by the umpire forces the batter to be out whether or not the infielder tries to get the batter out while complicated and difficult for outsider to understand the rule has been in baseball for a long time and makes sense in context  the title text continues the comic after megan is ruled out even though cueball misses the catch the ball now enters the golf section of the field meaning that the players would have to hit the ball into a golf hole to score given that the ball is much larger than a standard golf ball this would prove difficult however before they get this far the situation changes as the ball rolls into a separate section of the field called the ice hazard on a golf course a hazard is either a bunker with sand or a water hazard if the latter type freezes over it could be called an ice hazard however in this metaball game this section of the course is apparently used to play some form of ice hockey and since the game has been held up when megan was called out they will now have to restart the game with a face off a skirmish between two players of opposing teams to restart the game it can be argued that an ice hockey puck can be considered a ball since ice hockey has evolved from and is a variation of older stick and ball games and since they play both baseball basketball and golf with the association football they could also continue playing ice hockey with this ball instead of a puck for the record there are several other versions of hockey that are played with a ball ball hockey for instance and at least one of these is played on ice see broomball in these games face offs are also used it seems likely that randall has chosen some of the most popular sports of the us and then used a soccer/football instead of an american football given the timing of this comic with the us collegiate basketball tournament we may assume randall is writing as a response to that he has previously given an opinion on sports see for instance 904 sports 1107 sports cheat sheet and 1480 super bowl this concept is very similar to calvinball from the comic strip calvin and hobbes by american cartoonist bill watterson
