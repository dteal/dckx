n these two friends both presumably male since female characters in xkcd are depicted with hair are surprisingly cavalier in taking the suggestion to engage in sexual experimentation to alleviate boredom even if both men are gay the fact that they're friends as the rule in the book describes them suggests that they are not currently having sex on a regular basis in this case and even more so if the friends are heterosexual most people would not take the book's suggestion and it may even make them feel embarrassed and awkward the book that one of the cueballs grabs appears to be some sort of all encompassing rule book its reach including the social sphere obviously this book is fictional but the line i think there's a rule about this sounds like a reference to folk rules or guidelines like the five second rule crisco is a brand of shortening a fat that is solid at room temperature and frequently used in baking though is also commonly as a sexual lubricant in this instance it's implied that it will be used as a sexual lubricant crisco was referenced again in a sexual context in the title text of 414 mistranslations and later as a part of a weird dream also in the title text of 557 students the title text could be spoken by either one of the characters or randall it attempts to preempt any awkwardness or judgment the reader may have about this situation by transferring responsibility to the rule book
