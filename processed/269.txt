n cueball trained himself to type while asleep so he could communicate from inside his dreams he calls this trans consciousness messaging protocol or tcmp  he succeeds in using this system to send a message from inside his dream but his friends megan and another cueball like guy are disappointed when that first message is a trollish f1rst p0st instead of something constructive this cliche comment is typed by people on the internet after they discover a previously not commented post or creation such as this experience most social media sites display comments in chronological order so that the oldest comments are at the top and the newest are at the bottom most people only read the topmost posts thus giving cueball's post the most views see also 1019 first post and 1258 first and regarding trolling 493 actuarial bell &amp; watson refers to alexander graham bell and his assistant thomas a watson bell is traditionally credited with inventing the telephone because he was awarded the patent for it although that is still controversial his first phone call was to watson in another part of their lab the title text explains how this protocol if real would be of great value in dream research since you then would not have to worry about forgetting the dreams after waking up like as in  430 every damn morning you can relay the dreams as you experience them however in order for this to work the dream has to be lucid where the dreamer is aware that he or she is dreaming this type of dream is very fascinating to randall as mentioned in the title text of 203 hallucinations but thus this could never work for normal dreams and lucid dreams are probably easier to remember anyway
