n benjamin franklin was one of the founding fathers of the united states aside from uniting most of his country against britain's rule he was also a model of a renaissance man an author printer musician politician postmaster inventor scientist and diplomat some of his legacies include bifocals the franklin stove an odometer for a horse drawn carriage the almanac and abolitionist ideals he has since been honored with the use of his image on the $100 bill  franklin also did several experiments regarding electricity and invented the lightning rod he discovered the fundamentals of electricity including positive and negative charges as well as the principle of conservation of charge when franklin first wrote down his notes for electricity he defined a positive charge as one left on a glass rod by rubbing it with silk and a negative change as one left on rubber by rubbing it with fur without realizing it this meant that he had assigned a negative value to the charge on the electron later identified as the fundamental carrier of electrical charge in an electrical circuit we envisage the charge to be flowing from positive to negative this is analogous to energy flowing from a region of high temperature to one of low temperature or a fluid moving from an area of high pressure to one of low pressure  however because an electron is negatively charged the actual flow of electrons is in the opposite direction from negative to positive this reversal of the natural expectation has caused unnecessary confusion to many fledgling engineers in the comic the invention of a time machine was commissioned with the intent of preventing a robot apocalypse however the cueball that built and used the machine is an electrical engineer with misplaced priorities believing that reversing franklin's mistake takes precedence over eliminating a more immediate threat to the human race  cueball tells franklin that the charge left on a glass rod by rubbing it with silk should be the negative charge not the positive charge because the friction removes electrons from the rod this would not have been intuitive to franklin because the electron had not as of yet been discovered yet by telling franklin to reverse the positive and negative conventions this would ultimately result in an alternate universe where electrons are assigned a positive charge one can only speculate what other changes this reversal of convention would lead to as small changes tend to cascade into huge ones would the positron have been instead named the negatron and would this affect the success of the transformers franchise in the title text cueball defends his actions claiming that correcting the signs on every damn diagram is more important than preventing the rise of atrocity committing autocrats and deadly diseases cueball is likely voicing randall's own frustration with this breach of logic albeit exaggerated to comedic levels
