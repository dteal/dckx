n the comic appears to be a reference to 475 further boomerang difficulties which had a man throwing a boomerang that never returned cueball shoots an arrow off with a bow and a boomerang returns to him this confounds him as it was also a cueball that threw the boomerang in the other comic this may be the same cueball that now finally has his boomerang return to him after a long time 464 comics later this would really freak him out then the title text is a pun on how boomerangs always come back along with how the return of x is often used for movie names however as shown in the prequel as well as in an even earlier comic cueball/randall has to admit i am not good with boomerangs so for him it would be a surprise if the boomerang returned boomerangs also became a main theme in the interactive comic 1350 lorenz
