n at the beginning of the comic cueball is wandering around in a barren area supposedly a desert thinking about his ex partner in which he at first appears to be fondly remembering him/her but the last two boxes explain that he is trying to take a long walk to forget him/her and is obviously not very good at it the title text implies that his ex partner had easily forgotten him and he wishes that he could forget more easily it's also possible that he means that it's so hard to forget him/her that forgetting anything else is simple in comparison to it there is a similar twist in comics 71 in the trees and 1042 never note when cueball mentions walking 1000 miles he is most likely exaggerating as due to his lack of hiking/traveling gear most likely has only walked a hundred or so either that or the story is similar in nature or even in the same universe as comic 505
