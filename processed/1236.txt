n the equation should be read as follows the probability that i'm near the ocean given that i picked up a seashell is equal to the probability that i picked up a seashell given that i'm near the ocean multiplied by the probability that i'm near the ocean divided by the probability that i picked up a seashell this method of relating the probabilities of two events is known as bayes' theorem if you put a seashell up to your ear you can hear a sound similar to the ocean apparently inside the shell but the idea that this sound is actually the sound of the sea is just a popular myth hold only your hands close to your ears and you will hear the same sound the comic through an application of bayes' theorem points out that most of the time when you pick up a seashell you are in fact at the beach next to the real ocean so hearing the ocean at that location is not all that impressive but it's just real the title text points out that most instances where the author has picked up a seashell have been at the beach and nearly all of the times where he has picked up a seashell and not put it to his ear have been there this comic was released late and at the first version the formula was incorrect but it's corrected now
