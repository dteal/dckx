n tpp or twitch plays pokxc3xa9mon was the first of a creative and radical new variant of streaming gameplay videos created in early 2014 xe2x80x94 a few days before this comic was released some consumers enjoyed watching video games being played by other people usually 'popular' gamers known for entertaining gameplay thus streaming sites dedicated to streaming gameplay were created twitchtv was one such site whereas traditional video game streams involved the channel broadcaster or another personality playing the game the channel twitch plays pokxc3xa9mon recorded a bot playing an emulated game of pokxc3xa9mon red for game boy the game inputs given by the bot were based on players' messages in the video stream itself thus the watchers of the stream were playing the game themselves using chat commands the pokxc3xa9mon character behaved incredibly erratically frequently getting stuck against simple obstacles as mentioned in the title text and moving about in a strange manner why are you up there/byeokay coming back now  despite this the character advanced surprisingly far in games they have beaten the elite four and champion of generations i ii iii iv and v and vi twitch plays pokxc3xa9mon is currently on its second season and will play pokxc3xa9mon colosseum next you can see the state of the player characters' pokxc3xa9mon and inventory at game end in this bulbapedia article  tpp surged in popularity rapidly since its inception reaching 80000 channel viewers within five days derivative channels such as 'twitchplayers' soon arose turning twitch plays into an idea rather than a single channel; that of crowdsourcing a task such as controlling a single person as in the pokxc3xa9mon games for erratic and often hilarious results the stream which is still active as of this writing has reached memetic status in the above comic cueball and megan are on a date however megan is behaving very erratically cueball determines that megan is being controlled by twitch as her behavior matches well with that of the tpp protagonist whose name canonically is red  megan loudly declares at one point that she is saving her 'game progress' referencing the incessant saving in tpp via random button presses the random ten letter string she says is reminiscent of the nicknames that all of tpp's pokxc3xa9mon end up with as the players move haphazardly across the game's keyboard  her fascination with the cool spiral is an allusion to tpp players' fascination with the helix fossil an in game item as user input often leads to checking of the in game backpack followed by erratic commands to handle the items within it was common for various valuable items to be haphazardly thrown away however players quickly discovered that the helix fossil as a key item could not be tossed the players' realization that the helix fossil would stay in the bag almost permanently throughout the game caused tpp players to jokingly regard it with a near religious reverence for its constant appearance with many acting as if the protagonist was looking to the helix for guidance the title text as explained above simply is a light hearted joke from randall empathizing with tpp as he has also spent real life days stuck against simple obstacles and is surprised by how far he has gotten in life despite this fact
