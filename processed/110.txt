n frankly my dear i don't give a damn is the signature catchphrase from the 1939 movie gone with the wind film which starred clark gable mentioned in the comic title and vivien leigh the phrase is spoken by gable's character rhett butler as his last line in answer to leigh as scarlett o'hara's question where shall i go what shall i do the response indicates that butler is no longer interested in o'hara this disinterest and the mention of the word damn which was considered profanity at the time of releasing the film led to the line being voted the #1 movie line of all time in 1995's american film institute ranking randall suggests that the line as written was not supposed to contain profanity but the actor gable had tourette's syndrome which is a neurological condition that is stereotypically characterized by bouts of random uncontrollable cursing the title text contains a more stereotypical tourette's syndrome outburst of several profanities shouted in a row mid sentence
