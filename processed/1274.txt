n this comic is a reference to the us government shutdown in 2013 that had been ongoing for a week and was still current as of the time of this comic under some circumstances the united states federal government can temporarily shut down pending budget legislation being passed by the united states congress these shutdowns are typically due to political disagreements between the president the house of representatives and the senate due to the shutdown numerous government services and facilities are shut down often resulting in many logistical issues for the public over the years various conspiracy theories have been proposed claiming that the united states government is not controlled by publicly elected officials but rather by one or more organizations that secretly control the actions of the government sometimes termed a shadow government in this strip randall writes a letter to the shadow government telling them that the situation having the country's government shut down is embarrassing and asking them to fix the problem this comic also implicitly argues against the plausibility of the aforementioned conspiracy theories if one assumes that a shadow controlled government would be more likely to operate with a singular purpose and therefore be less susceptible to paralyzing political disagreements randall previously alluded to this in the title text to comic 1081 really the comforting side in most conspiracy theory arguments is the one claiming that anyone who's in power has any plan at all this is one of several comics in which randall expresses dismay at how many intelligent people can fall for absurd conspiracy theories;
