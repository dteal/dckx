n this comic shows a graph with three parts first the names are sorted up by genera plural of genus a low level taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms from bottom to top of which animals would win in a fight secondly the names within the genus are then sorted by coolness of name from left to right the degree of coolness of the name is apparently determined in subjective manner by the author thirdly in red you can see the direction that apple has taken with nicknaming the versions of their os x operating system they started at v100 cheetah and have moved through genera from there in no order that this chart can make out    os x version  code name  year released   100 cheetah 2001   101 puma 2001   102 jaguar 2002   103 panther 2003   104 tiger 2004   105 leopard 2006   106 snow leopard 2008   107 lion 2010   108 mountain lion 2012  please note that the second words in snow leopard and mountain lion are capitalized in the table because they are used as the proper names of the operating system versions in their normal use as species vernacular names they are not capitalized and are written as snow leopard and mountain lion bobcats are a running xkcd joke so their inclusion is to be expected the genus puma here only lists synonyms for the puma see cougar instead of the actual genus of course the three os x versions named by three of these synonyms are not the same since this comic was published apple has stopped naming versions of os x after big cats now apple names their osx versions after californian landmarks osx v108 mountain lion was followed by v109 mavericks named after a beach in california followed by v1010 yosemite named after the california national park and v1011 el capitan named after the rock formation in yosemite national park the title of the chart depicted on the comic os x problem is perhaps an allusion to the travelling salesman problem as the directed arrows and graph nodes might appear as a possible path of the salesperson between the cities the computational difficulty of the travelling salesman problem might echo with the difficulties that the author has with trying to figure out the underlying reason for naming the os x versions in particular order the chart thus looks like a parody on the scientific presentation in the title text despite being named after hogwarts the magical school from the harry potter series of books and movies dracorex hogwartsia is real on the other hand all of the contestants listed for the most badass latin name competition have problematic credentials smilodon combines two greek roots for carving knife and tooth tyrannosaurus combines two greek roots for king and lizard stygimoloch combines a greek root with a semitic root and dracorex contains two english roots and a greek
