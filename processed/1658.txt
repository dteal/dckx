n estimation is difficult; many people seem to greatly underestimate the amount of time or other resources required to illustrate how difficult this estimation is douglas hofstadter coined hofstadter's law which is a non scientific self referential time related adage mentioned in the the title text it states it always takes longer than you expect even when you take into account hofstadter's law ponytail is working at her computer and becomes frustrated as it seems her project will again take much longer than she has estimated she is annoyed with herself for always failing to make a decent guess danish begins to give ponytail advice on how to estimate the time starting with the comforting words donxe2x80x99t panic and a common guideline of taking the initial estimate and doubling it danish then iterates the law once more and she tells ponytail to double this again and then add five minutes unless the project to begin with was estimated to somewhat less than an hour those five minutes will do nothing but confuse ponytail but danish does not stop here and iterates hofstadter's law once more ponytail still doesnxe2x80x99t get where this goes saying a hesitant okay to that it turns out that danish was not at all trying to help but just mess with ponytail as she now tells her that the only thing she has accomplished by listening to her advice is wasting half a minute doubling imaginary numbers ie even her first estimate is just something she has imagined especially since she states herself how bad she is at those kind of estimates finally danish completes her frustration of ponytail by saying paaaniiic negating the initial advice the title text is an extra corollary to the law that states that using the law to estimate anything about the time your project takes is not only wasted time you could have spent working there is a substantial risk that you will conclude that you will never finish and thus panic instead of just get the job done now self reference is a recurring theme on xkcd and this comic is quite self referential both in the comic but also referring to other comics especially to 917 hofstadter he is perhaps most famous for his book gxc3xb6del escher bach from where the quote is taken in a section on recursion and self reference rather than estimation this book has been directly referenced in  24 godel escher kurt halsey
