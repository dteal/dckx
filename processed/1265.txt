n juicers are typically used to crush fruits and/or vegetables thereby extracting the liquid juice and creating a tasty refreshing and easy to consume drink however in this case instead of actual fruits or vegetables someone is making juice from fruit gushers a chewy fruit flavored candy thereby extracting a nearly nutritionless artificial juice out of a candy casing which was formulated specifically for human consumption this may or may not be a parody of recent fruit gushers television commercials in which fruit gushers are shown to squirt out nearly limitless amounts of juice the title text asserts that the rind is where all the vitamins in the fruit reside this is a common belief of actual fruits although it is an untrue urban legend for many fruits; even fruits like apples do not contain most of the fiber and many antioxidants in the skin itself but rather directly below; although when you peel an apple you remove more than just the skin losing also some high fiber and antioxidant content anyway it is absolutely absurd as in this case though as the rind of a fruit gusher consists mainly of sugar this text mocks the usual sentiment that the less desirable part of a food is the part that is better for you it is also a parody of the notion that buying a juicer or other things like exercise equipment will automatically make people healthier here it is shown that what you do with the juicer is the relevant factor the comic can also be interpreted as parodying the idea of fruit juices being healthy though this is widely believed recent studies demonstrate otherwise
