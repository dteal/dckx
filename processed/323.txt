n this comic is about alcohol and programming ability programmers sometimes have a reputation for drinking habits and programmer gatherings such as hackfests tend to offer copious amounts of alcohol more generally intoxicated programmers can get the impression that by being a little disconnected from physical reality they become more efficient at their programming the comic is a take on this belief with two references  in atomic physics balmer peaks with one 'l' are peaks in the emission spectrum of hydrogen named after the 19th century scientist johann balmer steve ballmer with two 'l' is a key figure of microsoft and its ceo from 2000 to 2014; he is known for energetic outbursts and outlandish behavior in public with some videos gone viral which can give the impression that he is constantly intoxicated  the curve in the comic suggests that while generally decreasing with alcohol intoxication at just the right level the skill of a programmer gets terrific indeed randall named the peak after steve ballmer as if discovered by him; this references the analogously named balmer peaks with one 'l' and the idea that steve ballmer makes for an easy association of programming and alcohol the peak of the curve occurs at a bac of 01337% which is a reference to leet see this interview with randall the end of the comic turns the whole idea into a sideways jab at windows me a version of microsoft windows often criticized for being buggy slow and unstable it suggests that me was developed by programmers completely drunk because their managers wanted to exploit this ballmer peak but did so without any precaution that idea fit well the result of a buggy and unstable product on the contrary the title text claims that apple uses this effect with careful calibration by delivering precise quantities of alcohol schnapps to its programmers via intravenous therapy iv an actual research reported on december 2014 showed that the situation described in this paper is not far from reality the peak in reality is 0075 and in the comic it is 0131
