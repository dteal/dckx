n this comic is an illustration albeit to a comical degree of the principle that given the appropriate vocabulary any technical concept should be understandable to a lay audience since most of the jargon used in rocket science is not among the most commonly used words in everyday life randall has challenged himself to translate the blueprints for the saturn five rocket using only one thousand of the most commonly used words in the english language this comic is a diagram of the saturn v rocket saturn isn't a very common word apparently and neither is rocket so randall decided to use up goer which is a fair approximation of a craft designed to lift a payload from the earth to space the saturn v vehicle which was in use by nasa from 1967 to 1972 is the vehicle as a whole the engines of the saturn v the part that makes it go up were divided into three stages the first stage s ic had five f 1 engines which burned refined kerosene mixed with oxygen as its fuel that stage burned for 2 minutes 48 seconds and pushed the whole thing up about 61 kilometers ~38 miles into the sky after it fell away the s ii stage was activated it used 5 j 2 engines in the same configuration as the f 1s and burned liquid hydrogen mixed with liquid oxygen for 6 minutes 35 seconds pushing the astronauts up to 184 kilometers 1145 miles the third stage s ivb was a single j 2 engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen this stage was used in two parts the first was to put the spacecraft into a stable orbit around earth to perform a systems check and make sure the craft will be safe for going to the moon this would usually take three orbits around earth as they came around the earth they would burn the second part of the fuel which is called a trans lunar injection which put them on course for the moon the first burn took 2 minutes 45 seconds which put them in orbit 185 kilometers 115 miles high it was first used as the launch vehicle for the apollo 4 mission and it was used as the launch vehicle for most of the subsequent apollo missions the exceptions being apollo 7 skylab 2 4 and the apollo soyuz test project missions which were launched using the smaller saturn ib launch vehicle one of the last missions of this design was the unmanned launch of skylab the us's first space station; for this payloader configuration the saturn v launch vehicle was officially designated the saturn int 21 the service module sm oxygen tanks have a note that states this part had a very big problem once this is a reference to the apollo 13 mission 55 hours after launch mission control requested the oxygen tanks contents be stirred to get an accurate reading of its contents there was a large bang and power fluctuated throughout the craft nasa had to scramble to ensure the safe return of the astronauts needless to say the moon landing for that mission was canceled the hindenburg disaster is referenced in the text the kind of air that once burned a big sky bag and people died and someone said oh the humans the term big sky bag is used as the closest approximation of zeppelin which is a big bag filled with a lighter than air gas which makes the whole contraption float the phrase oh the humans is a workaround the simple words rule technically containing only the word humans while being read concentration of humans or humanity the hindenburg on the day of the disaster was filled with hydrogen despite being initially designed for use with helium helium cannot catch fire as it is a noble gas and thus completely inert but helium was unavailable due to a us export ban on the element the risks seemed acceptable at the time because the germans had a history of flying hydrogen based passenger airships the original quote is oh the humanity see this video about the hindenburg disaster the quote appears at 047 in the book thing explainer in the explanation for the pieces everything is made of ie the periodic table hydrogen is again named by using a picture of the burning hindenburg and also this quote is said by cueball standing next to the square with the element with his hands over his mouth see more below regarding the book the bottom tank which randall describes as full of that stuff they burned in lights before houses had power is highly refined kerosene called rp 1 it is similar to jet fuel burns well and is not likely to explode; unlike liquid hydrogen which is much more likely to explode earlier flirts with simple words can be found in 547 simple and 722 computer problems  the use of simple words was revisited again in 1436 orb hammer the phrase you will not go to space today has become something of a catchphrase for xkcd xe2x80x94 variants of it recur in the title text of images in four what if articles  building a jetpack out of ak 47s and converting the potential energy machine gun jetpack the one about flying on other planets the pilot does not want to go to space today interplanetary cessna launching into earth orbit if your rocket cannot hit the right horizontal speed you will go to space today and then you will quickly come back orbital speed the pyramid of giza the energy that made it is not nearly enough to launch a rocket into space; the title text has another reference to the comic noting that the tip of the pyramid should point towards space pyramid energy  randall has in 2015 written an entire book with this type of simplified language blue prints thing explainer was published by houghton mifflin harcourt on november 24 2015 and actually had a copy of this comic in it on the day of the book's release randall also released a comic with a game to celebrate the book 1608 hoverboard in this game the space capsule used for landing back on earth is shown thus both referencing the book and this comic this part of the space ship can also be seen in the book above the sky toucher and the moon landing is also depicted in worlds around the sun the news about the upcoming release of the book was sent out on the blag in may as new book thing explainer after that the book was advertised at the top of the xkcd page with link to the blag article and links to preorder at amazon barnes &amp; noble indie bound and hudson also there were two other news with links in other news space weird thing is delightful and i feel surprisingly invested in @xkcdbracket's results the link was removed sometimes before monday the 10th of august 2015 within two weeks of the brackets final result was revealed the song space weird thing is a tribute to david bowie's space oddity rewritten in the simple language used in this comic which is also attributed in the text about the youtube video the other news item is related to 1529 bracket see that comic for more details the title text may be a reference to kerbal space program where a big problem is mixing up the staging and deploying the parachute before launching
