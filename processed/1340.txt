n in this comic cueball is excited about the current date and he states this date the date the comic was released as 2014 03 10 with year first then month and date this follows the international standard as defined in the iso 8601 standard he then continues to points out to megan and her cueball like friend that this date will never happen again the gregorian calendar is the current way to count time in years months and days since time moves only forward dates will never repeat every date is thus equally unique even when the digits aren't in a pattern  many people do however make a big deal about dates when the digits follow an interesting pattern such as 2000 01 01 or 2012 12 12 they might plan special events on these unique days for instance 2007 07 07 was considered a lucky day and had a record number of weddings this is because humans in general are superstitious and like and recognize patterns in every day life also including patterns in the numbers used for stating dates but this does not make these dates more unique than any other dates nevertheless cueball has made it into  his hobby to point this daily uniqueness out and having to listen to him stating this fact everyday would be incredibly annoying to his friends the title text refers to the long now foundation who uses five digit years eg this comic's date would be written 02014 03 10 this is an effort to encourage people to think in terms of long term benefits rather than only the coming years or decades the y2k problem was due to using only two digits to store the year which would have made dates ambiguous when it rolled from 99 back to 00 similarly the maya calendar had a repeating cycle of 52 years and even their long count rolled over after 7885 years as we currently use four digit years this may cause a y10k problem the long now foundation designs a 10000 year clock that should be able to run for this long xe2x80x94 and in principle it could display every date up to 9999 12 31 randall remarks that by coming close to the year 10000 our civilization probably will follow this recommendation unless our civilization is already extinct a previous comic on date formats was 1179 iso 8601  randall addresses date formatting confusion again in the title text of 1467 email
