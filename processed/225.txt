n richard stallman or rms after his handle is an old school hacker known these days primarily for establishing the free software foundation fsf and initiating the gnu project in the early 1980s which produced major portions of what would later be the gnu/linux operating system in this capacity he's also known for being one of the most ardent and outspoken proponents of free software sometimes called open source software in fact his advocacy is so emphatic and polemical that he has garnered active dislike from traditionalists who believe that software source code should be retained as a trade secret by its developers stallman has expressed that he did not even wish to be in a comic using the word open source see the trivia section while this dislike may not rise to the level of hiring ninja assassins to remove him from the world it is strong the joke of the comic as it also turns out is that the two ninjas were just out to have a fun time teasing stallman and they seemed to know that stallmans paranoia about microsoft makes him sleep with no less than two katana swords near his bed this type of swords were one of the traditionally made japanese swords that were used by the samurai of feudal japan a ninja was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal japan their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the samurai caste who observed strict rules about honor and combat so this makes sense in this comic with stallman the samurai and the ninjas the lackeys of the oppressing microsoft at least in his mind it also turns out that they specifically chooses a target for their raids that have reason to be paranoid of come larger companies that might send someone after them and thus sleeps with weapons near their bed stallman has received a katana due to this comic see the trivia section gpl refers to the 'gnu general public license' which is a copyright license written by the fsf that covers much gnu software and plenty of other free software besides it stipulates that software so copyrighted must always be provided along with full source code and that everyone in possession of such software is free to use study modify and redistribute it for any purpose whatsoever including sale or resale provided they give due credit to any other contributing developers also provide access to the complete source code and retain all copyright notices legally this gives all users of such software exactly the same rights under copyright as the developers and prevents any developers from ever taking away those rights from users which is the defining feature of 'free as in libre' software it also has the effect of making all software derived from gpl software thereby also gpl even if 'derived' merely means 'borrowed a few lines of code from' some eg microsoft's steve ballmer have therefore argued that this makes gpl software behave as a kind of 'license virus' which spreads gpl guaranteed freedoms to any software used in close conjunction with gpl'd software during development such that businesses should actively avoid adopting free and open source software so as not to jeopardize software developers' legal standing with regard to proprietary ip copyrights during the attack richard stallman begins to speak like he quotes an old play for instance the wording for a gnu dawn is pronounced for a g'new dawn following the pronunciation of gnu so it is a version of new dawn a sentence used often in fiction he even gets annoyed when it turns out the ninjas just run away he had clearly waited a long time to even looking forward to defending himself with his katanas because as it turned out that the two ninjas made a prank with him and they realized that they had so much fun out of stallman that they plan to do more of these nightly raids even mentioning two other possible future targets on their way out of the window eric s raymond is a famous hacker who wrote the cathedral and the bazaar and has been something of an unofficial spokesperson for open source as a software development methodology the plan to prank eric raymond could be a bad one since he is an experienced martial artist swordsman and firearm enthusiast however this seems to be the attraction of these two ninjas as can be seen by what they seems to know about their other possible target linus torvalds is the creator of the linux kernel an free/open source operating system kernel inspired by the unix kernel which proved to be the final component that combined with then pre existing gnu system functions and userland components produced the first fully free operating system linux the plan to prank torvalds would at first sound more boring as the mild mannered finn while known to be strongly abrasively opinionated is otherwise mostly harmless however one of the ninjas seems to know otherwise since it is rumored that linus sleeps with nunchucks in the same way that stallman sleeps with two katana swords the nunchaku is a traditional okinawan martial arts weapon consisting of two sticks connected at one end by a short chain or rope a third possible target of this prank is mentioned in the title text ralph nader is a famous consumer rights advocate most famous for the 1965 book unsafe at any speed and for running for us president in 2000 nader was an environmentalist a member of the green party and supported clean energy thus he should naturally be opposed to the big oil companies
