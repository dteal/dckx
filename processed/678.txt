n this comic suggests a translation from the statements of the researcher of a potential new technology these statements might be found in for example an article in a popular science magazine which highlights some cutting edge research it reflects the idea that researchers tend to be too optimistic about the future of their research project the fourth quarter of next year even if a technological development seems very close to completion it could still be canceled by some authority other than the lead researcher this might be due to poor management or a poor business plan or even a poor scientific basis which the researcher is hiding or ignoring five years the researcher has solved the interesting scientific problems and assumes that the concept could be picked up by a business developed to be usable outside of a research lab designed into a prototype have a manufacturing process marketed and made available to consumers in only five years in reality a lot of exciting sounding technology may not reach consumers for many years because of difficulties in the business side of things ten years not only does the researcher assume that the business end of things will go smoothly he also assumes that the rest of his research will go smoothly in reality a lot of unforeseen problems could arise during research 25+ years it has not been conclusively proven impossible indicates that it has been proven impossible in some context the researcher simply refuses to accept the impossibility until the proof is conclusive we're not really looking at market applications right now in contrast to the above chain of assumptions in this case the researcher has a working technology but wants to keep it to himself title text 20 years away indefinitely sometimes the technological or engineering challenges for a certain application seem like they could be overcome in 20 years but in reality the challenges are very difficult the more the challenges are studied the harder they are found to be although there is always hope that a few more advances will do it an example is fusion power which has been conceptualized since at least 1946 as a potentially unlimited source of clean energy but remained an elusive achievement despite projects such as the national ignition facility and iter the first commercial plant is still indefinitely 20 years away a similar table was shown in 1497 new products
