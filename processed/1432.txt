n ponytail is trying to get cueball to consider a hypothetical situation for the sake of argument it appears that cueball is questioning the wisdom of doing so and postulating that assuming unreal hypotheses for the sake of argument is a stupid thing to do because it causes more arguments ponytail then claims she is playing the devil's advocate and cueball again lambastes her for advocating for somebody as unsympathetic as the devil in a debate or discussion to play the devil's advocate is to take a position with which you do not necessarily agree and typically which no one involved in the argument agrees to allow further exploration of the subject as the title text starts to explain it can be a device used to explore a different viewpoint to gain a wider understanding arguing for a view with which you do not agree can provoke a re evaluation or conversely a re affirmation of your previously held view by considering the merits of the potential counter argument to be able to play the devil's advocate convincingly is the mark of a well rounded debater however cueball interprets her statement literally thus assuming she is arguing on the side of the devil the religious entity defined as pure evil obviously it would be ill advised to take his side during a debate cueball then pulls an ironic twist on ponytail by revealing that he was questioning ponytail's argumentative style for the sake of argument himself the comic actually plays on the double meaning of argument ponytail refers to a statement in a debate while cueball suggests a quarrel in the last panel in the title text an exasperated ponytail is trying to explain to cueball that she is trying to use these debating techniques as a device to explore and broaden her understanding of her reality or a plausible alternative cueball derails the conversation by comparing these attributes to a boat which also allows you to explore other areas and broaden your experiences and understanding as mentioned earlier in 209 kayak ponytail is rendered speechless by this statement and cueball further suggests that they should get a boat and that ponytail can bring the devil too
