n cueball runs into some problems with his network connection and contacts his internet service provider's isp's tech support for help the customer service agent represented by hairy is not very helpful giving clearly pre scripted advice that has nothing to do with cueball's problem cueball gives up and asks to speak to an engineer ie someone more knowledgeable about the technology and suggest to hairy what to look for noticing a woman with black ponytail who has the stuffed tux penguin on her desk and a poster of a bearded dude with swords a reference to richard stallman particularly as he stands in 345 1337 part 5 he tells cueball about her and cueball recognizes the signs of a gnu/linux geek and asks to talk to her hairy transfers him over to the engineer who immediately recognizes the problem and fixes it then she tells him of a secret word shibboleet see below which if he speaks on the phone will transfer him to a tech savvy person able to help him something installed already back in the 1990's by the geeks of that time cueball is elated but then at this point cueball wakes up and unfortunately discovers the incident to be just a dream poor customer and technical support is a common complaint of many isps  many isps outsource their support staff to foreign countries to reduce costs and/or they delegate first tier support to workers with little or no training  typically these workers are given general scripts that prompt the customer to try common troubleshooting steps such as restarting the computer without any specific knowledge of the customer's complaint  while these scripts may help resolve problems for the average customer a representative using such a script is usually unprepared to assist someone who has a more advanced problem  furthermore these scripts generally assume that the problem is on the customer's end and do not acknowledge problems that occur within the isp such as server or line problems customers like cueball often find it frustrating to deal with representatives reading from scripts  as randall mentions in the title text this frustration is magnified when the representative refuses to move on to the next step until the customer has performed the previous one whether or not it necessary or helpful  in cases like this it's often necessary to request an escalation to a higher tier of support or to speak to a supervisor who presumably has more knowledge and/or influence though even that can sometimes be a painful process thus it is easy to see why cueball would be elated to discover a way to automatically connect with the most helpful technical support representatives whenever he has a problem and thus also why he get really dissapointed when he realizes it was just a dream dreams being a recurring theme in xkcd cueball is running haiku an open source operating system which is still in a state of active development having had no official release as of yet while low level tech support operators are given scripts which are predicated on the assumption that many computer problems are actually caused by the actions of clueless end users as in fact they are it's exceedingly unlikely most of these first tier operators would have even heard of haiku not to mention that their scripts' assumptions would never apply to the sort of person who would be using an experimental os as opposed to windows for instance shibboleet is a portmanteau of shibboleth and leet a shibboleth means any word custom or other signifier which is used by members of a group to recognize other members or those who are in the know about something its use originates in the hebrew bible where the precise pronunciation of this word was used to distinguish gileadites from ephramitites leet based on the word elite refers to leet speak a practice of character substitution and abbreviation common across the internet or teh 1n73rn3t as you would say in leet thus shibboleet is a shibboleth used to identify someone whose computer knowledge is elite leet is again in leet written as 1337 so again a reference back to the 1337 comic series including the comic mentioned above with stallman
