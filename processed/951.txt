n this comic is a jab at price gouging shoppers who spend large amounts of time checking multiple shopping outlets for the best deals the minimum wage is the lowest possible wage that a person could legally be paid usually only targeted at providing unskilled laborers with an equitable level of income in 2011 when this comic was published us federal minimum wage was $725 an hour though certain states and cities typically have higher minimum wages using simple math the caption states that a person is effectively working below the minimum wage when they spend their time looking to save a few cents on their purchases randall's math checks out $725/hour times nine minutes would equate to just over $108 benjamin franklin's adage a penny saved is a penny earned is usually taken to mean that a person merely by making the effort to save their money rather than spending it frivolously has put in worthwhile effort that makes them deserving of that money cueball flips the meaning of the phrase instead saying that saving money is work just like a job and as one would not take a job that paid less than minimum wage the compensation is inadequate for the amount of effort it would take to drive to a cheaper gas station of course if you are unemployed and cannot expect to get any wages it could still be worth your time the title text however then goes on to talk about how the extra fuel consumption involved in finding cheaper gas leads to more extra money being spent on gas than is actually saved at the cheaper outlet this problem has also been examined in what if cost of pennies see also 1205 is it worth the time however randall neglects to consider the effect that customers have on prices  if customers consistently go out of their way to get the lowest prices then sellers will be motivated to lower their prices to attract customers  on the other hand if customers consistently purchase from the most convenient seller then sellers can raise prices without losing business
