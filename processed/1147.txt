n in a pokxc3xa9mon game a player goes out in search for the eponymous creatures many pokxc3xa9mon can be found directly in the wild but there are also a lot of pokxc3xa9mon that require training and growth to cause them to evolve into new pokxc3xa9mon evolve the game's term is a misnomer which earned itself quite some controversy in the past; in reality pokxc3xa9mon evolution is more akin to puberty or metamorphosis since instead of the entire species of pokxc3xa9mon acquiring changes through an extended period of time one specific member of the species grows instantly to the higher stage at that point in the game the pokxc3xa9mon glows before transforming into the new form then stops glowing and the very same text what xxx is evolving is used see this video or those screenshots for instance the changes of such a transformation can be quite dramatic  or not this comic depicts the evolution of bacteria as observed by a biologist in the same format as the game pokxc3xa9mon here we have staphylococcus aureus which is not a desirable bacterium it causes staph infections which evolves into methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus methicillin is an antibiotic if the bacterium becomes resistant it means the antibiotic will be less effective against it making infections harder to treat thus the observer is not pleased with such an evolution the title text references this by suggesting that biologists do not want bacteria to evolve in this way as opposed to pokxc3xa9mon where you put a pokxc3xa9mon on the front lines as much as possible to gain it experience and hope it evolves a point of irony is that pokxc3xa9mon evolution can easily be prevented by using an everstone or stopped by pressing the b button in the game controller during evolution especially if there are pokxc3xa9mon that one does not want to evolve the bit about the front lines is that if a bacteria colony is exposed sufficiently to an antibiotic those bacteria with any level of resistance to the antibiotic are less likely to be killed by the antibiotic and are able to reproduce in spite of the antibiotic most future generations of bacteria now have this level of resistance instead of just a small subset this makes the likelihood of future more resistant and harder to treat mutations even more likely staphylococcus aureus is a very common bacterium that under an electron microscope looks like the xkcd drawing and is the major cause of staph infections in the nostrils and skin hospitals are often plagued with outbreaks of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa which is very difficult to treat as the typical antibiotics do not work on it
