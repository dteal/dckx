n the skateboarding subculture has taken up the phrase skateboarding is not a crime in protest of how many cities have banned skateboarding in certain areas such as parks randall apparently really does not like these stickers and states that when he becomes president any and all displays of stickers bearing the phrase like the one on the locker in the comic will be considered a felony though skateboarding itself will still be legal the title text also shows another protest phrase arrest me i'm a skateboarder that randall hates even more than skateboarding is not a crime
