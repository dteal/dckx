n cueball is being asked by a friend for the temperature while he is checking his smartphone for the weather he begins pondering what unit he should use when answering the question see below for cueball's reasoning in the us where cueball and randall are from the temperature scale used in daily life is fahrenheit  however celsius is commonly used for science even in the us  most of the rest of the world also uses celsius in daily life  the celsius scale is from the metric system though this system has been officially sanctioned for use in the us since 1866 it is not frequently used in daily american life although it is the preferred system for trade and commerce according to the metric conversion act of 1975 the us remains the only industrialized country that has not adopted the metric system as its official system of measurement the unit degree celsius or xc2xb0c is an accepted derived unit from the international system of units si units used in science which again is the modern form of the metric system the si unit of temperature is the kelvin but this temperature scale is linearly related to the celsius scale which is why celsius can be derived from it the fahrenheit scale is from the us customary system also known internationally as the british imperial system the unit is degree fahrenheit or xc2xb0f and the relation to the celsius scale is not easy to find in a mental calculation the relations are xc2xb0f = xc2xb0c*9xe2x81x845 + 32 or xc2xb0c = xc2xb0f xe2x88x92 32xc3x975xe2x81x849 for this exact reason randall has previously made a helpful table for these situations in 526 converting to metric  cueball weighs up the benefits of both scales but fails to find a solution he can live with and since he feels he has to give his friend an answer now he panics and gives the answer 0173 radians  radian is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics an angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle it has no units and is denoted with the superscript c but more commonly rad lest it be confused with angular degrees angular degrees is a system used to measure angles in geometry and although it used the unit xc2xb0 it has nothing to do with temperature gradations of whichever scale   thus this answer is unhelpful and the joke is that traditionally both geometrical angles and temperature is measured in degrees but there is not the slightest degree of correlation between the two the title text indicates that cueball's friend still wants to know whether the answer is in radians fahrenheit or radians celsius which despite being a silly way to express temperature would actually enable the friend to get some meaning out of the reply but this just takes cueball back to the problem he failed to solve in the first place of choosing one scale above the other so suddenly he has to go and he runs off without ever clarifying what he meant this result is probably because he is afraid of being a bad friend according to his very last point regarding fahrenheit valuing unit standardization over being helpful possibly makes me a bad friend the answer cueball gives of 0173 radians corresponds to a geometric angle 991xc2xb0 0173 xc3x97 360xc2xb0/2xcfx80 if this were radians celsius it would be 991&#160;xc2xb0c corresponding to 498&#160;xc2xb0f and if it were radians fahrenheit it would be 991&#160;xc2xb0f corresponding to123&#160;xc2xb0c given the temperatures in massachusetts where randall lives when this comic came out the day after valentine's day 2016 cueball was probably giving his answer in radians fahrenheit
