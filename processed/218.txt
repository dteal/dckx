n the nintendo entertainment system released in north america in 1985 helped revitalize the video game industry after the video game crash of 1983 with such games as the super mario bros series the legend of zelda the mega man series castlevania and metroid helping it stand alone as what is still considered by many people today the greatest video game console of all time however it was notorious for glitching games upon start up due in no small part to the unusual shape of the game console which required one to open the door push the game cartridge inside push down to lock it in place and push the power button the console was deliberately designed this way so that it wouldn't look like a regular video game console and wouldn't be associated with the still fresh stigma of the video game crash only two years previous but it caused no end of pain for people wanting to play the games it would work fine for about two years but after that cartridge tilt would become a problem as either the game's or the console's electric contacts could become misaligned a ubiquitous fix for this problem among gamers was to take the cartridge out blow into it and put it back inside all to clean out any dust inside the cartridge that would make cartridge tilt worse and occur more frequently this was not a recommended solution by nintendo of america and didn't always work but it worked frequently enough to enter gamer culture and even today people who had the nes as children remember having to do that the nes was 22 years old as of the date this comic was written someone who was 10 years old when they got their nintendo for christmas could very well be old enough in 2007 to have attained their doctorate degree and so this comic hearkens back to the aforementioned cartridge fix by suggesting that a heart surgeon might try that on a real life heart patient and like the introduction states that is a scary thought the title text is one of many xkcd references to the terrifying velociraptor predator from the dinosaur movie jurassic park
