n the comic is set in the future with two hovering robots discussing ancient history in particular the clothing styles of kings and queens of the now extinct human species it appears that robot archeologists have long ago unearthed remains from one or more human civilizations providing evidence to build a concept of what humans must have looked acted and even sounded like recently they must have discovered or determined new evidence which presumably indicates the wearing of colorful clothing by human monarchs until this occurred they had very little if any reason to believe that any humans wore clothing noting the previous knowledge that some humans had metal rings around their heads they have drawn the conclusion that these formed a separate species human kings and the crown is a natural outgrowth of the skeleton when dinosaur bones were first dug up the idea that dinosaurs were scaly reptilian like creatures was developed with the information available at the time in recent times it's been discovered that most dinosaurs actually had feathers and in well preserved specimens often from the jiufotang formation in northern china feathers of various forms are clearly visible as this runs counter to the widespread and long held image of dinosaurs as dramatic reptiles the public has been reluctant to accept this new discovery especially as the addition of feathers often conjures up the image of a giant chicken see 1104 feathers had it been discovered that dinosaurs were in fact covered with 6 inch long razor tipped spikes people may have accepted this immediately as it conforms to the stereotype of dinosaurs as killing machines in the same way the new information on kings and queens being covered in fabric runs counter to the movie inspired image that the robot on the right had about humans picturing them as being pink warriors that could grow metal out of their heads the head metal image may have been inspired by the discovery of kings and queens buried or entombed with their crowns lying on top of their skulls for example the electress palatine anna maria de'medici if the robot beings in this comic don't know enough about human anatomy they may assume that the metal crown is a specialized part of the human skeleton since they themselves are made of metal they may conclude that humans also were part metal shown at least some evidence pointing to the truth that humans typically wore clothing and that a monarch's crown is only a symbol worn atop the head and not part of his or her body the robot is predictably disappointed humans wearing clothing reduces them in its opinion to big pillows much like dinosaurs with feathers reduces them from primal beasts to big chickens something made of cloth or covered in it at least in this robot's mind cannot be a significant actor in history the robot fails to reason that among other things history was what it was and its wanting things to have been a certain way does not make it so in addition just as the clothing wearing human is more than a mere pillow and would have held much fearsome power over the world a feathered dinosaur is not necessarily merely a giant chicken but is still a powerful killing machine the reference to colorful fabric may also be indicative of the popular and mistaken view that all ancient statues particularly ancient roman and greek sculpture were white instead many of the statues were painted sometimes rather gaudily due to the low availability of various dyes and the paint has merely worn off leading to the present belief that ancient athens was a city of shining white marble porticoes colonnades and statues major landmarks in washington dc were planned to emulate this perhaps inaccurately perceived style including the capital building and the white house which although popularly believed to have been painted white to cover fire damage from the war of 1812 was already being called the white house in 1811 well before the fire the title text references our failure to change the popular image of dinosaurs to reflect the way they truthfully once were randall jokingly suggests that we should apply the same featherless is cooler logic to popular images of bald eagles since they are modern dinosaurs and remove their feathers only in depictions of them presumably leaving them entirely bald he appears hopeful that such a direct comparison using the national symbol of the us no less would provoke the public to change its mind about how dinosaurs are viewed since modern raptors birds of prey are typically viewed with awe and respect and are not often associated with the chicken stereotype mentioned above
