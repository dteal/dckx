n there exists a current fashion among car owners to place decals on their back window that represent their family the decals consist of stick figures to depict the parents and children perhaps shown doing a favorite activity and even pets the first car window features a couple with three children while the other shows just a couple cueball and megan with piles of dollar bills and two large bags with dollar signs on them the humor comes from the opportunity cost implied in this xe2x80x94 not having children allows you to avoid the expense of raising them and accumulate money for your own use one might expect that the cars would represent the difference in wealth and they are identified as 'urban suv' and 'sporty hatch back' in the official transcript the larger car is a subaru outback which is a typical car used by families the second car is a honda fit which is a budget compact hatchback in the comic it has a spoiler added the subaru outback is more expensive now than the honda fit which seems to fit perfect with the comic's implication since a family of five have to buy the large expansive hatchback being able to buy a smaller car that doesn't need to hold a five member family also allows you to save more money the title text refers to the humorous description of cats as the real masters of their household and the little girls surrounding the cat refers to their ability to influence humans with their cuteness as referenced in 231 cat proximity the implication is that any adults in the household have a limited non credited role the title text could also be a reverse of the stereotypical crazy cat lady instead of someone owning a very large quantity of cats it could be one cat with an ungodly number of little girls also decals based on this comic do in fact exist
