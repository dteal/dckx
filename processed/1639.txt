n the imprecision of recipes is often a source of frustration to culinary novices especially the more analytically minded cueball expects a recipe to provide instructions precise enough that by following them carefully a cook can create a dish exactly as the recipe author intended unfortunately exact replication is impossible in cooking because of the natural variation of ingredients as well as differences in equipment in addition most home cooks lack the tools needed to make precise measurements such as scales and thermometers thus a recipe for strawberry smoothies might read add sugar to taste because the recipe writer can't specify precisely how ripe the strawberries are to begin with in addition a smoothie recipe would typically specify imprecise quantities of fruit such as 1 banana or 1 cup of strawberries much less precise than specifying the weight thus it is impossible for the cook to determine the correct amount of sugar without actually tasting the drink the instruction to taste can also be used for ingredients that alter a simple aspect of the food's flavor such as sweetness sourness saltiness or bitterness without affecting the quality of the overall dish individual preferences can vary wildly and it's not possible for a recipe's author to predict how much the reader will want specifying any exact amount in these cases will inevitably lead to the food being too bland for some while being too strong for others in this comic cueball is shown as having no idea how to cook or having a ridiculously large sweet tooth and the suggestion that he is going to add large crates of sugar to a small pot is of course silly this would ruin the dish as whatever was in the pot would be drowned out by the sugar alternatively he could simply bring in enough sugar to make sure he will not run out of this particular ingredient before it reaches the correct level of sweetness for his taste this too would display a complete lack of understanding about what it is to cook; even a beginner cook should be able to logically deduce that this is far too much sugar the title text is randall's and cueball's personal comment on what he thinks a recipe should do to fulfill his needs if he knew how much of each ingredient would be appropriate for a given dish then he would not need the recipe in the first place the title text actually scolds the recipe for being imprecise in his view mixing in imprecise or use your own judgment language makes it less of a recipe for the dish and thus less suitable for those looking for the specific instructions to make the dish because they either have no cooking experience feel they don't have the expertise to make their own decisions or simply want to follow clearly defined steps without any decision making required this is the second comic this week that concerns one of the basic condiments for food and also regards one of the five basic tastes the first one about salt was 1637 salt mine lately randall has made several food related comics
