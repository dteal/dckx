n this comic is a joke about the hyperbolic expression shut it down being taken literally if someone thinks that a device has achieved its goal they shut it down after an idea or product that people think is well made is created people will joke that the process that created it should be shut down as if the process has achieved its ultimate purpose this is most often used sarcastically for an inferior product or idea taking things literally is a common theme in the xkcd comics curly hair sits at a computer anxiously and nervously writing a message to someone she cares about deeply possibly a child to be adopted or a romantic interest curly hair plans on saving enough money to have the person flown to her location from half a world away curly hair ends the message with a promise to communicate daily until the two are able to meet when attempting to send the message however curly hair discovers that their internet connection is down and the message goes unsent ponytail explains there was a ridiculous video to which someone had commented that's it shut down the internet we're done this was taken literally and because enough people agreed with this comment the internet was shut down and curly hair was left unable to communicate with her love the joke being that the internet was creating something far more valuable between curly hair and her love than a ridiculous video thus highlighting the beautiful and far reaching potential impact of the internet the likelihood of the entire internet being shut down based on a single comment being vanishingly low adds to the humor in the final panel curly hair states wistfully that she was not done with the internet the title text is ponytail's response which asserts ponytail's belief that curly hair's message could not be important because the facebook comment asserted that nothing of any significance could come from the internet after the ridiculous video
