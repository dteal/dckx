n in computer programming a variable is a way of storing information temporarily for use later in the program there are different types of variables called data types such as integers strings characters and booleans all of them holding different types of information integers hold whole numbers strings hold text and so on variables traditionally have names that identify their purpose and a programmer should usually be able to infer from this variable name what type of variable it is for example if you want to store the name of the customer in a catalogue service you might store the text in a string variable called nameofcustomer because it is fairly clear that names are made up of text it is logical that this variable would be a string variable if you didn't have any other information about it a sigil in computer programming is a symbol that appears before the variable name it is an alternative method of telling someone who is reading the program code what data type the variable is rather than relying on logic then to know that nameofcustomer is a string you might use a sigil $ before the variable name as in $nameofcustomer which would specify that the variable can hold text sigils can also specify the scope of a variable which refers to where the variable can be used in a program and which parts of the program can access that variable sigils are useful in some ways because you don't have to refer to previous program code or find where the variable is declared created to know what data type it is they also provide some level typing in languages that do not explicitly declare the type of the variable most programming languages have a different method for storing variables although some languages may use the same variable types under different names the following are the programming languages referenced in the comic and how they use variables  qbasic variables of type string end with the $ symbol other symbols are used % for integers&#160; for single precision # for double precision and in some versions of basic &amp; for long integers however the usual qbasic program will use only the $ symbol and not any of the others as the default type if no symbol is used is double precision and that's ok for most numeric uses  c++ pronounced see plus plus variables are just words with regular letters it is the name of the language itself that includes symbols  bash this is not typically thought of as a full featured programming language but a unix shell however the shell command syntax is rich enough to be able to write simple and sometimes really complex programs called shell scripts in this language all variable dereferences start with the symbol $  perl in perl variables of simple types ie scalars and references to items in arrays and hashes start with $ arrays start with @ hashes start with&#160;%  python variables are just words with regular letters  google in the beginning google was only a search engine however it now includes many things in particular a social network called google+ pronounced google plus google+ accounts are referenced with a + prefix  twitter twitter account ids are identified by the leading symbol @ when an account is mentioned in a tweet using @ it triggers smart behavior for example account owners can configure twitter to forward tweets that mention them this feature was not present in the early days of twitter  hashtags in 2007 twitter users began a convention that a # sign whose many names include the hash can be prepended to words to mark them as keywords twitter could then be searched for those words in 2009 twitter recognized the existence of hashtags and began hyperlinking them some other microblogging services followed suit  google+ eventually added hashtag support as did facebook  as is noted by the comic the use of sigils to indicate types of variables varies between programming languages from strict enforcement in languages like perl to their complete absence in languages like c++ but see hungarian notation the comic notes that the use of sigils seems to be cyclic especially if you count things like hashtags as extensions of the pattern the title text describes the two competing influences responsible for the cycle the first impulse finds sigils useful to elucidate the type of the variable especially when variable names are not very descriptive while the latter impulse notes that descriptive variable names are much more useful for that purpose especially in extensible languages where the built in types form only a small part of the type system
