n this comic is a riff on bumper stickers that say honk if you love ____ here the subject is formal logic but the word if is replaced with a formal logic term iff which means if and only if if and only if connects two statements saying that either both statements are true or both are false in this case either someone likes formal logic and honks or doesn't like formal logic and doesn't honk the title text further elaborates on this describing a practical situation that is stopping for pedestrians and dissecting it with formal logic terms the joke is the contained self reference you have to love formal logic to take the sticker seriously and honk for exclusively that reason the title text reveals the sticker is actually there to stop people from honking at him altogether because randall understandably hates it when he yields for pedestrians only to get honked at by some impatient driver behind him; the only reason you're allowed to honk is to declare your love for formal logic
