n lego blocks are a popular building toy which cueball here uses to describe a philosophical conundrum the distinction between a composition and the collection of parts that make up that composition for example the lego blocks he and his daughter ponytail used to make a house are still around; they were put back into the bin and can be used on future designs however the house itself as a specific combination of those blocks is gone it ceased to exist when they took it apart in essence they killed the house those blocks could be used to build a car or an airplane so if there is still a house in the box after it has been dismantled then there is also a car in the box and a plane in the box and a large number of other objects in the box making it a very crowded box thus it is more logical to consider the house to be one possible arrangement of the lego blocks that only exists when the blocks are put in that arrangement later in her life ponytail extends this thinking to humans and organ donation the us has an opt in system for organ donation; in the event that you die any of your organs or tissues that remain functional after your death can be donated for transplantation or medical research provided you've opted into the organ donor registry ponytail compares her organs to the lego blocks she's carrying even if she the composition dies her organs the pieces can continue to serve another as such she is compelled to register as an organ donor the title text is the same question asked in the first panel asked from this new perspective instead of asking where the lego house went the questioner presumably a young child possibly still ponytail is asking where his/her grandpa went humans are a composition of many parts; the parts are usually buried or cremated when we die but the composition is something else entirely what exactly happens to a human composition after death is a question for religious debate but we know for sure it doesn't stay here
