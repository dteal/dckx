n code talkers are persons who communicate using their native language not known by the enemies the most well known code talkers were the navajo speaking marines serving during world war ii this comic shows a navajo code talker transmitting an encrypted binary file by speaking one and zero actually neutral as explained in the title text into a microphone by using only two words the code is easily cracked unlike the navajo marines this process does not add security because it easily can be decrypted and is also much slower than simply transmitting the file over a network note that probably unbeknownst to randall the actual code used by the navajo code talkers was not so far removed from the depiction in the comics the navajos used a mostly alphabetic code with one navajo word for each english letter this meant that even though the axis captured at least one native navajo speaker he could not make any sense of what was said however several important terms were given their own navajo idioms so the entropy would be somewhat higher than depicted in the comic the title text is a disclaimer from randall about using neutral instead of zero; navajo has words for the concept of nothing but not for the numeral zero
