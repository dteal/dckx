n cueball is making love with megan but like many highly introverted people his attention is split between his inner and outer worlds part of his mind is counting her touches and another part is wondering why his brain does these things automatically and without his wanting it to this worries him and makes him feel guilty because he isn't giving her his undivided attention which he believes she deserves as he unwillingly counts her touches he recognized the fibonacci sequence this recognition shocks him it's like she knows what is going on in his head and secretly sent him this signal to tell him that it's okay she understands awestruck he is reassured and glories in her love the title text makes this clear he is able to stop worrying about the counting and he is able to let it continue just in the background it doesn't stop but it isn't nearly that important or salient as the touching done by megan
