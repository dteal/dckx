n it is a common thing for people on the internet on forums and comments sections of various websites to make vague generalizations about the stupidity of all people or losing faith in humanity for instance when the topic is actually the stupidity or irrational/extreme behavior of one individual or group of individuals also the comment can come in any type of internet forum regardless of the subject however the overall world population people is not more stupid than the average by definition there is also no other human population to compare to to draw the conclusion this population is stupid so it is a stupid comment that white hat makes the award being given to him by cueball is thus a very sarcastic one it is possible that for a non normal distribution of intelligence a median individual could be less intelligent than the mean however the statement as it is usually formulated including here people are stupid refers to humanity as a whole white hat's anecdotal and subjective experience has led him to make a statistically impossible statement white hat's self perceived superiority may be an example of the lake wobegon effect so named because lake wobegon a fictional city is where all the women are strong all the men are good looking and all the children are above average the last panel may be a reference to the first annual montgomery burns award for outstanding achievement in the field of excellence which is a fictional award in the story of the simpsons episode brother can you spare two dimes where it is presented to homer simpson in the title text the other phrase about having lost their faith in humanity also gets a comment on the way from cueball there are people who use this phrase every time someone disagrees with them or say something they think is stupid he jokes that he will let humanity everyone other than the guy who makes the comment know that he has lost faith in them and very sarcastically remarks that humanity will probably be crushed ie the rest of the world does not care if that guy has lost faith in them
