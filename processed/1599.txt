n amazon has added bottled water to its line of on line home order goods which they are calling prime now  in served areas which include manhattan/brooklyn baltimore atlanta miami dallas austin houston indianapolis chicago seattle portland los angeles minneapolis san francisco san jose san antonio las vegas sacramento and phoenix many products xe2x80x93 including but not limited to bottled water xe2x80x93 are available to be delivered within one hour so we are faced with the prospect of water contained within plastic bottles contained within cardboard shipping boxes as increasing amounts of water are ordered on demand or as the delivery time decreases to even quicker than an hour this would show increasing numbers of packages passing from amazon hq or its distribution hubs to an arbitrary end user as shown in the comic  beyond a certain already impractical point it might be better to merge packaging together into a single longitudinal structure through which one could first deliver back to back bottles of water as shown in the second to bottom illustration and then as water quantity needs increase beyond that model eventually just 'pipe' the water without the plastic bottle or any packaging at all as shown in the final illustration  this would also solve the problems of what happens with the packaging at the destination or how to return it to the source to make it easier to re use while this could apply to one degree or another to any merchandise for the purposes of the comic and for the reasons described next water was chosen for this example xe2x80x93 because that's really what existing water mains do and hence randall's recommendation or vote that we start calling the regular municipal plumbing on demand hyperloop style water delivery in order to promote any 'new' technology various buzz words are used and here it is hyperloop reminiscent of elon musk's 'piped transportation system' which from the outside at least appears to be taking discrete passenger units trains cars buses and planes and replacing them with a stationary pipe within which the passengers 'flow' albeit in this case still within discrete internal vehicles not entirely like futurama's 'piped people' which might be a bit messier randall suggest trying to get someone to buy into this idea only to later realize that they have just bought the idea of tap water the comic also seems to jab at the unnecessary buying of bottled water when most places in the western world have perfectly drinkable water in the pipes however not that all recipients like mains water hardness softness and various additional water treatment chemicals can affect taste and the action of water with detergents and in some cities it might even be unwise to drink tap water at least for tourists which is why there is still a healthy business for bottled water of many brands with subtleties to taste even in households and establishments with piped water available the other explanation for cynics only is that the marketing budget for bottled water creates the industry see the gruen transfer episode on bottled water season 2 episode 3 #13 where the marketing is considered in the title text randall tells that when he was a kid he was asking his parents why there were not an additional pipe for toothpaste next to the water pipe  amazon thinking the same way is a sarcastic jab implying amazon saw toothpaste tubes and wondered why water wasn't delivered the same way in small bottles  both are implied to be examples of childish ideas but amazon is actually following through on theirs the idea of a toothpaste tube is revisited in 1649 pipelines the outflow volume from amazoncom has earlier been compared to the outflow of water of the amazon river in 1165 amazon
