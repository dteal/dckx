n gary gygax was a game designer best known for co creating the iconic nerd pastime dungeons and dragons d&amp;d; as such he is commonly described as the father of d&amp;d he died on march 4 2008 three days before this comic was released it made him the first person to receive tribute in conjunction with his death on xkcd but not the last the idea of playing games typically chess with supernatural entities in exchange for one's soul is an old one and has been referenced in many works but mainly known in the form of playing chess against the personified version of death which was made famous in the seventh seal the last part of this trope is used in this comic here the specific twist is that the victim can choose which game they want to play naturally it is only fitting that gary would challenge death to d&amp;d the problem is that dungeons and dragons isn't so much a game as it is a set of rules for describing stories it requires the intervention of a dungeon master or dm to create a scenario which the players' characters must overcome it's unclear exactly how the game between gary and death works but given that d&amp;d generally takes a long time to play due to the setup time and large amount of dice rolling and the fact that gary seems to keep adding extra rulebooks official or pseudo official books which add new classes items spells etc for players to use it's understandable why it would take longer than death's boss would like part of the humor in this comic comes from the fact that death's boss who would presumably be an extraordinarily powerful entity appears to be a completely ordinary man in an ordinary office complete with bald patch and potted plant death's usage of the name jesus in the final panel may be considered ironic given that he's well death
