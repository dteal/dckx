n megan and cueball are sitting quietly engaged in their own solo pursuits  without any preamble megan answers a question that has not been asked pointing out to cueball that he would not be able to obtain milk from her breasts right now as she is not lactating  cueball is flabbergasted that she seems to have read his mind as this was exactly what he was wondering this comic is a comment on the fascination and sheer lack of knowledge that men have about women's bodies in general and their breasts in particular megan like any other adult female mammal is capable of producing milk from her mammary glands  however this facility is not always available; megan would have to get pregnant and give birth to trigger the bodily changes that result in lactation this is unless she can perform lactation without pregnancy it is possible but extremely hard in the third panel megan's legs are not seen probably tucked under the armchair to feel more secure the title text indicates that this is not proof of megan's psychic powers as cueball seems quite obsessed with this particular topic although if you interpret it as a response to cueball's thoughts in the last panel it could remain ambiguous
