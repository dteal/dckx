n a relative of cueball is depicted who explains how he goes about sending a youtube video to someone the relative appears to be a stereotypical 'non computer person' perhaps the father or grandfather of cueball the relative explains how he first saves a web page and opens it in microsoft word then uses the 'share' feature in word to generate an email that contains the web page reformatted as a word document then sends that email to a service that extracts youtube videos perhaps this service would then email back a link to some extracted file on some server and this link could in turn be copied and pasted in another email which could finally be sent to the intended recipient it's all very complicated the premise is that non computer literate people will find a clumsy highly elaborate way of achieving some task on a computer they will do this by stringing together the functions they stumble upon in the few software packages they have limited familiarity with rather than taking a more sensible straightforward route in this case a much faster and simpler route would be to copy the address of the youtube video from the address bar in the browser then paste the address in an email to the intended recipient the caption says that though randall encourages his relatives to solve their computer problems on their own by trial and error he has to resist the urge of asking them the method they used that method is likely to be unnecessarily complicated perhaps this complexity inefficiency or illogicality will cause randall to be exasperated or perhaps randall feels it is unwise to tell them why their method is inefficient because of the possibility of humiliating or upsetting them especially after they have spent a long time experimenting to find this suboptimal solution; it would be disrespectful to correct them or perhaps it would take too long to explain an alternative even a much simpler one because of the questions that it would lead to or because of the further misconceptions that would be exposed of which the relative should be disabused the title text just explains another example of a complicated and elaborate way of working that people who don't understand computers can create
