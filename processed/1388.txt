n in structural geology subduction is the mechanism by which one tectonic plate disappears under another this process usually creates a mountain range on the second tectonic plate as water entrained in the subducting plate rises into the second plate and provokes volcanism often resulting in a volcanic arc in this comic beret guy is very happy because he has just received his subduction license which may be a play with business term production license his roommate cueball very reasonably asks him your what but instead of answering him beret guy begins to move towards him in their small room it turns out that the license has literally enabled him to initiate subduction as he moves towards cueball he slowly sinks under the floorboards of the room and in this process he creates a small mountain range on the floor in the end much to cueball's consternation these mountains turn his desk and chair over cueball actually falls out of the frame in the final panel where beret guy is already halfway down beneath the floor the title text plays on the double meaning of the word normal which cueball means in the sense of like most people not strange but which beret guy interprets in the geological sense while subduction occurs when two plates crash into each other a normal fault occurs when two plates are moving away from each other here normal is used in the sense of perpendicular as the result of a normal fault is often that part of the crust moves vertically downward forming a graben a similarly atypical license was mentioned previously in 410 math paper puns on geological terms including types of faults were previously made in 1082 geology this comic was featured in a page of thing explainer as part of the explanation of the big flat rocks we live on only the last three panels where used probably because the words in the first panel were way too uncommon for the book see more details here
