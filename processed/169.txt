n this is a reference to a mistelling of a joke see the first of the meta versions under the wiki link  the original correct telling of the joke is  think of words ending ingry angry and hungry are two of them there are only three words in the english language what is the third word hint the word is something that everyone uses everyday if you have listened carefully i have already told you what it is  phrased this way the answer is language because there are only three words in the phrase 'the english language'  however this joke is often mis told by poorly phrasing the original riddle as it is in the comic by instead saying there are three words in the english language that end in ' gry' the teller of the joke has actually removed any chance of determining the correct answer as such when cueball attempts to say the answer is language and act smugly about it black hat is unimpressed and cuts off cueball's hand however as black hat mentioned in the comic if you count obscure and archaic words there are english words that ends withgry some are listed here the title text refers to postmodernism a philosophy and corresponding art movement postmodern music is often minimalist as exemplified by the weird sounds of philip glass and steve reich and postmodern visual art saw trends such as lowbrow and installation art gain attention apart from a rejection of modernism however it is difficult to outline postmodernism to justify the strange works of art deconstruction is another important concept but it is difficult to describe the process in short postmodernists make art that no one understands and may act smugly about it; but they do not adequately explain what their art means or it doesn't really mean anything ie there is nothing to understand thus black hat's statement that such practice is not cleverness applies to them as well
