n this comic is a reference to the comic book and movie character batman who is actually wealthy playboy bruce wayne as we see on the left being referenced as master wayne by his butler alfred batman in contrast to superman and other comic book heroes has no superpowers xe2x80x94 he's just an ordinary guy in a bat costume or a man dressed like a bat despite the accuracy of this description it sounds pretty stupid if you take a serious line and replace batman with a man dressed like a bat in the middle is the stick figure representation of batman and on the right is the joker as played by the late heath ledger each of these is an actual scene from a batman film specifically the dark knight trilogy with the subject text replaced in this way randall is pointing out that batman commands a lot of respect and fear considering that all he is is a man in a costume then in the title text randall expresses his fear that christopher nolan the director/producer/writer of the latest batman trilogy was going to kill batman off in the then upcoming movie dark knight rises of course randall substitutes for batman as in the comic this causes a grammatical ambiguity which randall points out where the dressed like a bat could apply to the man or to nolan a similar ambiguity explicitly discussed in the title text of 1087 cirith ungol there has been several comics using substitutions but this may have been the first
