n this comic revolves around the similarities and differences between the concepts of analogy simile and metaphor as well as synecdoche and sandwich the dictionary defines a metaphor as a figure of speech that uses one thing to mean another and makes a comparison between the two for example shakespeare's line all the world's a stage is a metaphor comparing the whole world to a theater stage metaphors can be very simple and they can function as most any part of speech the spy shadowed the woman is a verb metaphor the spy is not literally her shadow but he follows her so closely and quietly that he resembles one a simile also called an open comparison is a form of metaphor that compares two different things to create a new meaning but a simile always uses like or as within the phrase and the comparison is more explicit than a metaphor for example shakespeare's line could be rewritten as a simile to read the world is like a stage another simile would be the spy was close as a shadow both metaphor and simile can be used to enhance writing an analogy is a bit more complicated at the most basic level an analogy shows similarity between things that might seem different xe2x80x94 much like an extended metaphor or simile but analogy isn't just a form of speech it can be a logical argument if two things are alike in some ways they are alike in some other ways as well analogy is often used to help provide insight by comparing an unknown subject to one that is more familiar it can also show a relationship between pairs of things this form of analogy is often used on standardized tests in the form a is to b as c is to d einstein famously used analogies to explain how radio works you see wire telegraph is a kind of a very very long cat you pull his tail in new york and his head is meowing in los angeles do you understand this and radio operates exactly the same way you send signals here they receive them there the only difference is that there is no cat  unfortunately nobody was any the wiser after hearing this&#91;citation needed&#93; synecdoche is the naming the whole of something by referring to a part or vice versa eg using the internet when meaning the world wide web which is only a part of it; or using band aid when referring to any adhesive bandage randall is saying that he doesn't really understand the difference between them but instead of using one of the names as a placeholder for them all that is as a synecdoche he actually uses the word 'synecdoche'  what a mind he has
