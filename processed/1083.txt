n sms speak is a style of communication which involves substituting numbers for letters and shortening phrases to get a longer idea across in fewer characters at the cost of readability the practice began first with text messages also known as sms or short message service which limited messages to 160 characters twitter has adopted a 140 character limit since its inception which allowed any given tweet to be received as an sms message with enough room for the user's twitter handle 15 characters max randall is poking fun at both the stereotypical senator and at teenagers supporting ron paul the dig at the senator refers to poor use of sms style abbreviations by older less tech savvy politicians who are hoping to appear more in tune with the modern world many politicians use sms speak in cases when their message isn't in danger of the character limit but where they are appealing to a younger demographic thinking it makes them appear to be modern to their target audience in reality it may do the opposite showing that they do not understand why sms speak is used at all  conversely modern teenagers often stereotyped as lacking proper writing skills due to character limits on services such as sms and twitter instead here produce coherent sentences expressing a political view there is a subtle dig that being drawn to  ron paul is a stereotypical political position for a teenager as paul is ideologically libertarian and the implication is that libertarianism is a position held while younger and politically or economically naive randall has also poked fun at libertarianism on several other occasions such as 610 1026 1049 and 1277 the teenager's tweet is almost identical to the stereotypical paul ite comment made fun of in the title text to 1026 only ron paul offers a true alternative a few years ago the sentence attributed to the teenager is the sort of thing that would stereotypically be assigned to a senator while the sentence attributed to the senator would be stereotypically assigned to a teenager however now the situation has changed and so randall comments that the internet has ended up in kind of a weird place  the title text discusses an idea that randall approves of originally suggested by a user on bashorg called h00k where a twitter bot be created to message politicians when they use sms speak unnecessarily this would presumably embarrass said politicians which might in turn lead to a decrease in their use of sms speak randall evidently considers this a good thing suggesting he finds the unnecessary use of sms speak annoying
