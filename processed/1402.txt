n this comic is a graph of the number of harpoons in space over time one would not expect that harpoons which are associated with old technology would be used in space which is associated with high technology any occurrences are unexpected and therefore interesting or funny the first peak states that a harpoon was in space during the apollo 12 mission and various possible explanations have been put forward see discussion section below one of more widely accepted theories proposes that harpoon brand of jamaican rum made it aboard the apollo 12 rocket despite a fair amount of research into the basis of the harpoon incident there have been no credible or official sources to confirm the presence of any type of harpoon on board apollo 12 as the presence of a harpoon on board would run counter to any official story perhaps that's exactly why it would be considered an incident the latter peak on this graph refers to the rosetta unmanned spacecraft as part of its mission it carried a lander called philae which has two harpoon tethers to anchor itself to the comet 67p/churyumovxe2x80x93gerasimenko rosetta was launched in march 2004 as shown in the graph and was scheduled to encounter the comet in august 2014 making this a timely comic rosetta maneuvered to enter orbit on september 10 and ultimately the philae lander touched down on the comet on 12 november 2014 although the harpoon system failed to deploy randall produced a live comic of the landing updating 1446 landing every 5 minutes with the latest progress the rosetta spacecraft also carries a disk micro etched with 13000 pages of text in 1200 languages donated by the long now foundation mentioned in previous comics this continues a recurring theme as seen in comics 111 firefox and witchcraft the connection and 231 cat proximity with two unrelated but interesting objects juxtaposed graphically with humorous results the title text compares the philae lander's method of deploying its tethers to whaling in which sailors would throw harpoons at a whale with the intent of killing the whale it was important to throw hard so the harpoon would stick in the whale so it could not get away and would tow the whaling boat until it got tired and could be killed thus the title text implies that the spacecraft is sentient and needs a motivation to fire the harpoons hard enough to stay anchored to the comet; to this end it has been programmed to believe that its mission is to kill the comet evidently this motivation was not enough as philae ultimately failed to deploy its harpoons it still managed to land though
