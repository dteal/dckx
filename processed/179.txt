n the comic largely references euler's identity this identity states that e^i*xcfx80 + 1 = 0 therefore e^i*xcfx80 =1 the humor from this comic is because of the seemingly arbitrary relationship between e xcfx80 and the identity of i the square root of1 e is the mathematical identity of which the derivative of e^x with respect to x is still e^x while xcfx80 is the relationship between the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter taking these two values and applying them to the value of i in such a manner makes it seem counter intuitive  that it would yield1 from basic analysis the above linked wikipedia page goes into good detail of how to derive this identity as does this youtube video the title text refers to how euler's identity is called upon in complex form separating real and imaginary numbers e^i*x = cosx + i*sinx
