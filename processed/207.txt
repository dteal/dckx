n this comic purports to finally answer the question what does 'xkcd' mean however instead of giving an answer as to what the letters actually mean according to randall it's literally just a word with no phonetic pronunciation he offers five quirky behaviors this is reminiscent of tv commercials that ask what does brand name mean it means happy activity the first panel shows a driver making a right turn at a red light a u turn on the connecting road and then another right turn returning them to their original direction presumably faster than waiting for the light right turns at red lights and u turns are legal in some states and at some intersections but not always hence this complicated maneuver is questionably legal the second panel shows cueball searching for his mobile phone by having his friend call it to locate the ringtone only to hear a ring from inside of his dog's stomach in the third panel graham's number is a very large number once celebrated as the largest number ever used in a proof although it is no longer the record holder and the ackermann function is a very fast growing function thus the function's output must be insanely large in fact ag64 g64 is actually smaller than g65 the fourth panel shows somebody walking in a pattern based on the position of black and white tiles on the floor this is further referenced in 245 floor tiles the title text refer to stigmata marks corresponding to jesus' crucifixion wounds devout catholics have claimed to have spontaneously developed stigmata
