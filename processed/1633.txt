n this comic is about planet nine a possible neptune sized planet far beyond the farthest planet neptune astronomers mike brown and konstantin batygin published a paper on 2016 01 20 only two days before the release of this comic the paper is called evidence for a distant giant planet in the solar system and shows indirect evidence that such a planet may exist inferred from an otherwise unlikely correlation between the unusual orbits of several dwarf planets see for instance also explanations for the layman of the results here astronomers say a neptune sized planet lurks beyond pluto and planet x discovered as this paper came out on the day of the previous comic's release 1632 palindrome this comic's release day was the first release day after the news came out this explains why this comic was released in the late afternoon rather than just past midnight as is often the case with normal releases  once randall heard this news he had to decide to do this comic instead of the scheduled comic and then invent and draw a completely new and actually very complicated comic resulting in several position errors about planet x before he could release this comic  now this planet could be called planet ix and is labeled planet nine on the chart as pluto the previously planet 9 has been degraded to a dwarf planet the x did however not only refer to the roman numeral note that mike brown is the astronomer that killed pluto or at least reduced pluto to a dwarf planet something that has been a subject in xkcd  before; see for instance 473 still raw this was the first of two times within a month where a new astronomical announcement of something discovered months before the actual announcement resulted in a related comic the second being 1642 gravitational waves but in that case randall seemed to know about it in advance as he even changed the normal release schedule to post the comic on the day of the announcement unlike here where he seems to have been forced to make a new comic up on the fly stating the obvious this logxe2x80x93log plot shows that for an object to be an unknown planet it has to be very far away since planets are big to explain why we haven't seen it yet with the log scale it is possible to go from a diameter of less than 1&#160;mm to an astronomical unit au on the y axis and from a distance of just 1&#160;cm up to thousands of au on the x axis randall's chart is very egocentric as it categorizes objects based on size but also on their distance from himself from me this distance starts at 1&#160;cm and an item on the chart reads skin flora thus distance is measured from the surface of randall's body skin/eyes rather than from his center of mass all the planets and moon that are marked on the chart are so far away that it will not matter if the distance is measured from randall's surface his center of mass or by the way anywhere on earth also the planets' diameters are so much smaller than the distance from earth that their real size would hardly take up any space in the chart due to the log scale the dots marking these 7 planets are thus not drawn to scale that should represent their actual size compared with the other planets but their distance from earth and randall is not constant even on the log scale especially not for the nearest planets as they can be on either side of the sun compared to earth the chart correctly states that if there was a planet that was at a distance from him smaller than its diameter he would be inside it although at the bottom of that region it's more like the planet that would be inside him as this line goes down to a diameter of 1&#160;cm if the distance is to the planets center this would also fit if he was only a radius away from the planet as randall is not inside the earth but really close to it earth is correctly positioned on this line however for earth which is marked with the largest of the dots he seems to have put himself a full earth diameter away from earth even using the center of mass of earth as it's position he should only have been 6350&#160;km away from it but now he places the measuring point of his distance to earth on the opposite side of the earth so his distance to it is equal to its diameter which would make a choosing a distance of 0&#160;km just as correct earth is just left of the 10000&#160;km line on both axis and earth has a diameter of 12700&#160;km which will fit fine with the center of the dot but not with the distance which should have been the maximum distance randall could be from it 0 or 6350&#160;km depending on the definition of distance from randall the iau definition of planet requires a solar orbit gravitational rounding and clearing the neighborhood a controversial at the time of its introduction calculation of relative size that excludes kuiper belt objects such as pluto the calculation regarding planet nine would make it large enough to meet the iau definition using this definition the chart quickly rules out birds and bugs although at a glance they could be mistaken for planets something that is especially the case for planes at night which are even called foolxe2x80x99s planetsxe2x80x99 in the chart a reference to fool's gold note that anything that is actually on earth is positioned within 60&#160;km from randall this is because if it is further away he cannot see them due to the curvature of the earth this does not mean that he intends to indicate that they cannot be further away from him than that the already known planets are prominently marked on the chart they are the solid black dots besides earth and planet nine the bottom row of three small dots are mercury venus and mars the top row of four larger dots but smaller than the dot that marks earth are from left to right jupiter and saturn visible to the naked eye and uranus and neptune visible through a telescope it is unclear how randall is calculating these distances especially to the three terrestrial planets since neither of these options work closest approach average mean current or maximum distance in the comic 482 height randall shows among other the distance from the earths surface to all the planets for especially venus and mars he shows that their distance changes a lot based on theirs and earth's orbital positions but he has neither used these loops to base the dot size or position as these loops clearly go closer than 1 au and only one of the planets are drawn closer than that it is thus unclear which of the three represents which planet but in the table below it has been reasoned that the dot situated at the largest diameter of the three inner planets planets should represent venus 12000&#160;km as it is almost twice as big as mars 6700&#160;km which on the other hand is more similar to mercury 5000&#160;km and given that the two dots furthest out are almost the same size it would make most sense if they represent mercury and mars since the outer dot never comes closer than 25 au and mercury never gets further away than 15 au it makes most sense to place mercury as the middle of the three and mars as the outer of the three dots below some objects are mentioned that are not on the chart and also other errors in position probably due the hasty creation of such a complex comic many of these objects as well as the planets with the errors mentioned clearly revealed can be see in this modified image which is also inserted and explained in the trivia section below pluto no longer considered a planet it was the ninth until 2006 is not marked on the chart but it would be below neptune just outside the pink region 2300&#160;km diameter and 30 50 au away this makes sense since that region is for dwarf planets not yet discovered and any one as big and close as pluto would have been discovered by now there is are thus also other dwarf planets that would not belong in the pink region one of them is even much much closer and is easily visible with a telescope ceres which would appear roughly below mars and jupiter 950&#160;km diameter and 15 4 au away from earth but this pink region is there to show where there could and most likely will still be undiscovered dwarf planets the moon is also marked on the chart with a gray dot almost as large as the gas giants dots the name is written in brackets since it's not a planet because earth is clogging up its neighborhood randall has messed up the positioning and the diameter of the moon as it is clearly positioned past a million km and it is only up to 400000&#160;km away from the earth the sun is not marked at all even though it is extremely prominent but as it is clearly not a planet it is left out it would per definition have been at a distance of 1 au and with a diameter of 14x106 km it would be well inside the region of things that we can see during the day note that objects this big will always be shining already a large planet such as jupiter is brighter than if it could reflect 100% of sun's light in general planets ruled out because we would see them during the day refers to objects big enough to be stars or brown dwarfs but the only star system other than sun that would fit on the chart is alpha centauri which at 437 light years ly is well within the right boundary that falls at 568 ly just before the distance to the next nearest star barnard's star at 596 ly from the sun a light year is 63241 au and with the 10000 au mark far from the right edge of this log log plot it is clear that also 100000 au and thus a light year is within the chart and this also goes for 5 ly planets ruled out by the wise survey refers to the wide field infrared survey explorer wise a space telescope designed to look for warm objects such as brown dwarfs which generate heat at their centers it was capable of detecting saturn sized or larger planets in the outer reaches of our solar system but did not find any wise would not have detected planet nine even if it exists because it is too small and thus too cold to be detected there is a chance that it can be seen in some more temperature sensitive measurements but these have not been checked for such a planet yet see here the word satellites is written on the border of two regions indicating that these can be in both regions some are small enough 10&#160;cm to be comparable to the space junk below see cubesats others are much bigger and would fit in the region above stuff we can see through telescopes although it may not be called a satellite in daily talk the international space station is in fact a satellite which is over 100 m in the longest direction it would thus be on the border to the planets ruled out because i would have noticed them above my house region just above the a in satellites 400&#160;km above the surface some satellites can be seen without a telescope like the space station the title text explains why some people confuse superman for a bird or a plane since superman often flies at the limit between the two categories in the diagram this is though not really true as can be seen in the bottom of the table below
