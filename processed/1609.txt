n unusual food combinations are often counter intuitive and can vary wildly by individual taste real world examples of unusual food pairings such as pickles and peanut butter french fries in chocolate shake or even the comfort food pairing of chicken and waffles pair sweet sour or salty foods with a food or condiment from a different group in many normal food pairings though the cross over between sweet savory and salty foods also exists such as ketchup a very sweet condiment being regularly applied to hamburgers and french fries both savory and salty foods in this comic randall lists twelve somewhat random food items below these megan delivers a line to ponytail and cueball where she claims that two items of food from the list above pick any would be a great combination some of these are obviously great together and much depends on personal taste but many combination will definitely not be enjoyed by most people living for instance in the us where randall is situated say ketchup and ice cream or hot chocolate and avocado but no matter which two megan chooses the response from cueball or anyone else would be the same he can see what she means with this combination randall suggests in the caption below that by using the right tone of voice you can put any pair of these food items together as an actually really good food combination and no one will challenge you on it this can either be because they have likely heard or tried other unexpected combinations that are highly recommended or liked but it could also just be because they are polite or did not really think about what you said due to your tone of voice cueball's agreement could also be due to some social pressure in this situation the same reason he will drink beer even though he does not enjoy the taste as in 1534 beer or maybe they are like joey from friends who love any combination of food as long as it is something he think is good by itself see this clip the title text extends the joke by recommending countering such a bizarre proposal with an assertion that the random pairing announced is an actual potato chip flavor popular in canada this plays on the fact that in different countries and regions cultural tastes can vary wildly for instance ketchup flavored potato chips are quite popular in canada but are almost never offered in us markets loblaws and lay's have run potato chips flavor competition in canada in 2013 15 with flavors such as maple moose bacon poutine jalapexc3xb1o mac n' cheese cowboy bbq beans similar strange combinations of potato chips are run either temporarily or permanently in other countries including the united kingdom in addition some parts of canada are used as experimental markets to test new flavors of potato chips
