n randall roughly plots how high school physics undergraduate level physics and a job at nasa somewhat increased his knowledge of orbital mechanics but this learning was apparently nothing compared to the direct experience of playing with the kerbal space program a rocket building and piloting sandbox game orbital mechanics can be somewhat counterintuitive the art of changing orbits involves relative velocities positions and times in complex interactions as soon as you try deviating from a perfectly regular orbit or start having to deal with n body problems and orbital resonances you have to coordinate your movements in possibly counterintuitive ways one example is that if you want to reach an object ahead of you on the same orbit you actually have to 'brake' to reach a lower orbit once at that lower orbit your angular velocity is faster and you can start to overtake your target after that manoeuver you then have to accelerate to increase your orbital altitude again which will end up reducing your angular speed so that you intercept your target at the title text randall admits that at the time when he did work at nasa he was not involved in orbital mechanicsxe2x80x94which is also true for the most other nasa employeesxe2x80x94but everybody was talking about this which in the end did increase his knowledge a little as can be seen in the curve after the job at nasa arrow
