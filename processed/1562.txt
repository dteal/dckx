n there's no i in team is a well known saying that tries to encourage teamwork by reducing each member's individual self importance the intention of the phrase is to remind team members that just as the letter i is not present in the word team focus on the metaphorical i ie individual self interest is not constructive in teamwork it can be used as a light reprimand to a team member who isn't cooperating with the reminder that when working as a team one cannot think only for oneself and must work in partnership with the rest of the team towards a common goal the phrase no i in team dates from the 1960s in the usa with printed references 1 showing it is familiar to baseball pitchers such as vern law as an aside it's interesting that it seems to come from baseball a sport where players have significantly more independence compared to say rugby in this comic cueball takes the sentence literally as a metalingual comment see jakobson's functions of language and he points out to hairy that the spelling or orthography of a word doesn't relate to its meaning an instance of the usexe2x80x93mention distinction cueball is using the same joke against hairy by saying there is a u in people who apparently don't understand the relationship between orthography and meaning there is a u pronounced as you in what cueball said implying that hairy is included in the set of people who mistakenly link orthography and meaning of course it's very likely that hairy knows that orthography doesn't determine meaning and could easily reply there's also a 'u' in 'people who understand aphorisms too literally'  the title text there's no 'i' in 'vowels' provides another illustration of the distinction between orthography and meaning a i and u are vowels notwithstanding the irrelevant fact that they are not included in the spelling of vowels orthography was the subject of 1069 alphabet
