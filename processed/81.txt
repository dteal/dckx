n a stereotypical loudspeaker announcement often referenced in tv and film is one in which a store employee or anyone else in charge somewhere where people gather like church or a school announces that a certain colour and model of car has its lights on or is blocking another car or is about to be towed a licence plate is sometimes included for greater clarity the dodge viper srt 10 was a version of the dodge viper available on the third and fourth generations of viper from 2003 2010 it was a very expensive sports car in this case black hat is up to his old ways as in addition to announcing that an srt 10 has its lights on he also announces that it has had its windshield smashed with a golf club he clearly only knows what instrument was used because he is holding the golf club and presumably was the one who smashed the windshield thus black hat is making an announcement which is ironically only useful after damage has been done to the car the lights are probably on because the attack triggered the car's alarm system which usually makes a car's lights flash repeatedly and sound either its horn or a programmed alarm sound the two license plates in the comic are personalized license plates which are plates with a custom set of characters which you can pay for if you desire they typically are intended to represent words but often have vowels missing to save characters or numbers in place of letters the one in the comic proper is clearly my toy xe2x80x93 suggesting that the owner was bragging about his car and perhaps that he has lots of money which may have irritated black hat; the plate in the title text is most likely dad's money which randall suggests is a real plate on a car outside his building suggesting that the driver's father paid for the car not something the average person would want to brag about as it seems fairly cocky and also suggests that the person can't afford the car on their own
