n sometimes in order to deter vandalism or avoid accidentally moving/setting off something of importance an important item like a fire extinguisher will be covered behind a wall of glass in case of emergency break glass and retrieve the tool however the depicted situation is funny because the thing behind the breakable glass is a glass repair kit this is ironic considering that the only way to reach it is by breaking the glass one might even use it to fix the glass broken to get it this joke is similar in nature to a useless machine however the broken glass that needs to be repaired is an emergency situation so it is important to have some less important glass to break to be able to get to the important emergency glass repair kit in this way it is not necessarily useless just ironic in the title text randall notes that he keeps his first aid kit in just such a type of emergency locker as shown in the comic he complains that it is expensive to have them installed in the wall but then the title text takes a gruesome turn when he continues by saying that at least for those lockers with first aid in them there is no need to pay extra for using safety glass for the cover safety glass doesn't break into sharp shards so would be used for the cover of such an above mentioned fire extinguisher cabinet for instance ensuring that the user will not cut themselves when breaking the glass to retrieve it but randall indirectly says that since the person breaking the glass will soon have access to a first aid kit then if wounded in the process of breaking the normal window glass they can as well be treated on the spot so it will be ok to let them get injured first aid kits and for instance defibrillators can be found at frequent places such as bus stations and shopping malls but never behind a glass that needs to be broken
