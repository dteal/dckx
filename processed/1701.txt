n       this explanation may be incomplete or incorrect more on the speed of sport cars and the race cars how much faster does it feel for a human to see a regular sports car on a high way and then a formula one car more on why a rocket seems slow also worth noting the acceleration deceleration experienced in a high speed car crash greatly exceeds what astronauts typically experienceif you can address this issue please edit the page thanks  in this scatter plot randall plots the speed of several vehicles including people on foot for normal sports and how disastrous a crash would be the punchline is that space rockets travel so dangerously fast and crashes are so utterly catastrophic that it pushes literally every other kind of crash to the slow and safe corner by comparison a similar punchline was used in the title text of 388 fuck grapefruit with the plot randall makes the observation that the danger of a crash is greatly influenced by its speed and highlights the concept of relativity between what we perceive as fast normal sports and two different types of racing cars vs a much faster vehicle a rocket during launch a rocket may appear to ascend slowly and of course it begins its ascent slowly but on the way to orbit it ends up moving very fast but before it reaches the more extreme speed regime it will be far away from the ground and the casual observer where there is nothing to compare this speed to as opposed to a race car speeding by a spectator during a race of course rockets are slow compared to the speed of light apart from the high speed there is also the altitude to take into account for a rocket launch and the vast amount of fuel needed to get into orbit and any sort of catastrophic failure is almost certainly fatal  racing cars are often involved in crashes but at that speed it is possible to construct them so even serious crashes may not be fatal although rockets are also made as safe as possible it is a completely different regime of speed and danger and the risk of something going wrong during a take off is much higher and it is impossible to prevent a lethal disaster if the launch fails during the ascent this results in a much higher mortality rate for each crashed rocket probably 100% vs crashed sports/race cars rocket launches are compared to normal sports presumably meaning people running approximately 25 km/h and possibly also polo horses galloping approximately 40 km/h nascar which reaches speed of 320 km/h and formula one f1 where the fastest race cars go 380 km/h although peak speed for an f1 car is higher than nascar the average lap speed is much lower as f1 tracks have slow corners while nascar ovals can be negotiated with much less speed variation it is also arguable whether f1 is more dangerous than nascar there have been fewer fatalities in f1 this millennium though fewer cars compete and races are of shorter duration a rocket launched to reach the iss needs to match the speed of the space station which moves at 27600 km/h a rocket that needs to escape from earth needs to reach 40270 km/h but so far no humans have escaped however the astronauts going to the moon came close with apollo 10 setting the speed record for manned flights with 39896 km/h it was only about 04% faster than the next 7 missions that in contrast to apollo 10 were supposed to land on the moon the lowest of the rocket speeds mentioned above  is still more than 70 times as fast as the highest speed for race cars the title text serves to emphasize the point further as an astronaut used to the several g's of acceleration during takeoff and overall much higher speeds would likely find a nascar car moving at ~300 km/h paltry compared to what they're acclimated and has supposedly aggravated nascar drivers by making a point of saying so and thus this is used to explain why there are no passenger seats in nascar cars to prevent astronauts from joining the drivers for a nice slow ride of the many charts in xkcd this one is notable for containing the fewest sample points of any scatter plots in xkcd
