n cueball as a news anchor has another cueball like character as guest in the studio a doctor who is also a trade expert however steven berlee turns out to be a fraud in reality he is a frustrated programmer willing to lie his way on to news show to share his message with any newscasters wiling to listen  every time you say backslash as part of a web address on air i die a little  the slash character / also known as forward slash is the correct way to separate distinct parts of a web address; for example in the address http//enwikipediaorg/wiki/slash_punctuation a slash follows the org and the wiki however some newscasters are unfamiliar with the distinction between the different types of slashes thus confusing the normal slash with the backslash  the wrong character they may also be somewhat overzealous by trying to specify forward  or backslash since just saying slash would be sufficient also as mentioned in the title text the backslash is used in addresses on a windows pc steven berlee claims that he suffers every time this mistake is made in a news program explaining his reason for cheating his way on the air steven's name is most likely made up as it seems to be taken from two or three of the inventors of the internet  dr steve crocker who has worked in the internet community since its inception he was part of the team that developed the protocols for the arpanet which were the foundation for today's internet and for this work he was awarded the 2002 ieee internet award his real name is stephen d crocker dr stephen wolff spelled differently than steve but the same as the real name of steve crocker he is one of the many fathers of the internet mainly credited with turning the internet from a government project into something that proved to have scholarly and commercial interest for the rest of the world at one point he managed a research group that participated in the development of arpanet sir tim berners lee's last name can made into the portmanteau berlee he is an english computer scientist best known as the inventor of the world wide web berners lee is the director of the world wide web consortium which oversees the continued development of the web  searching the internet list no one called steven berlee and the only references points back to this comic the title text refers to how in the windows operating system the backslash is actually used instead of the slash as a separator in contrast to unix based systems which use the forward slash thus the path to any windows file encoded in a uri uniform resource identifier would correctly contain the backslash character however placing such an uri into a web address to be shared on a news show would be completely useless as they are only accessible inside of a local windows domain usually one's own computer and no one would be able to access that file over the internet  in the title text steven complains that after having had the modern version of the internet for 20 years since early 90s and this comic was released in 2010 they should have learned the difference by now he also continues to claim that if they do not understand the difference between an internet url and windows directory paths and thus embedding these into their urls then he cannot help them with just a short lecture while he con his way to time on the air
