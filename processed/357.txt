n the saying you catch more flies with honey than vinegar means that people are more likely to be won over with politeness than hostility when cueball's friend tells him this after he replies to a noob using swear words he then says that the saying is literally false by saying that balsamic vinegar attracts more flies than honey he then tells his friend to try it with his own fruit flies fruit flies are attracted to the products of fermentation particularly to alcohol and ethanoic acid the acidity in vinegar is due mostly to ethanoic acid  when cueball's statement is found true as balsamic vinegar smells like sweet and decomposing fruit to the fruit flies his friend complains to his mother with a vitriol influenced by cueball perhaps to get some favor that she lied to him he then says that another saying a watched pot never boils is also literally false that saying means that an event that is monitored with impatient attention will seem to take longer in the title text it seems that randall explains why he wrote this comic xe2x80x94 his vinegar bowl attracted a lot of fruit flies however he has not done the experiment with houseflies the notion of a watched pot not boiling is ascribed to benjamin franklin under the pseudonym poor richard he writes a watched pot is slow to boil meaning time feels longer when you're waiting for something to happen1
