n randall is giving reason number 58 why he should not have children we see fictitious father cueball talking about the wikipedia entry for list of fatal cougar attacks in north america as stated many of the victims were young children near home if you tell a child about something dangerous but without giving them necessary context to feel protected from it you are likely to cause nightmares sleeplessness or other fear related issues in most cases this would be considered bad parenting hence this is a reason why a person who enjoys doing so perhaps should not have children the title text demonstrates that not only is cueball sharing factual information he is intentionally adding hypothetical detail eg yellow eyes glinting in your window to make the danger seem even worse the child is unlikely to agree that learning this is fun
