n broadly speaking this comic follows a long list of issues raised about physical limitations santa claus faces similar to other popular theoretical discussions such as the speed he has to travel and the omniscience he purportedly possesses and the mass of presents he has to carry xe2x80x94 the story of santa claus was simply never designed for a world with over 7 billion people spread through untold millions of homes this comic combines some basic physiology with the physical law of the conservation of mass more specifically this comic refers to the common tradition of leaving milk and cookies out on christmas eve for santa claus if one assumes that santa eats even a small percentage of the sweets left out for him the question comes up where all the cookies go megan suggests that since santa isn't that large he must poop them out somewhere and wonders if he does so in our houses cueball doubts that megan replies that mass cannot disappear completely; it has to go somewhere to which cueball comments that santa has a magic bag in which he could poop the magic bag referenced is the bag in which he carries all the christmas presents he delivers on christmas eve it is called 'magic' because a bag large enough to carry billions of presents would be much too heavy and unbalanced to carry on a sleigh pulled by only eight or nine reindeer thus it must be magic somehow megan is disgusted at the thought of santa pooping on peoples' presents an even more disgusting explanation is that the 'magic' bag might transform the poop into presents in which case it would not need to carry many presents at a time cueball proposes a third theory that santa only poops in a few houses leaving large quantities in those houses megan says that there may not be anyone that naughty in the world referencing the myth that santa will leave coal instead of presents for those who misbehave cueball replies that it is randomly determined whose house is pooped in burdening a smaller number of people specifically cueball quotes the beginning of spock's aphorism from star trek ii the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one the quote is used to justify the sacrifice people make in allowing santa to poop in their homes by citing the numerous other people who are spared his feces the title text puts forth yet another theory that santa doesn't poop in houses at all but off the side of his sleigh this may be equally disgusting to anyone or anything unlucky enough to abruptly receive a rain of poop from the sky this problem could be minimized by taking advantage of flights over water or uninhabited areas rather than cities according to 1070 words for small sets a few is referring to anywhere from 2 to 5 currently there are 19&#160;billion children in the world so assuming on average that one cookie is left for santa for each child and that santa eats one in every 5&#160;cookies he consumes 380&#160;million cookies in two 48&#160;hour periods due to the convenience of time zones approximately 48&#160;hours from when a day starts in kiritimati until it ends in hawaii; also most western christians including roman catholics and protestants observe christmas almost two weeks before eastern orthodox christians do according to google a chocolate chip cookie contains approximately 140 kilocalories therefore santa consumes 532&#160;billion kilocalories in the period of 2 days or 266&#160;billion kilocalories per day as the average human daily intake is 2500&#160;kilocalories per day santa has eaten 10640000 times the amount of daily kilocalories required by one human over the period of two days an amount otherwise sufficient to last for over 59111&#160;years for a human and producing 20&#160;million pounds of feces however if we consider the dietary requirements of both santa and the flying reindeer and the kilocalories that reindeer would burn flying around the world carrying 19&#160;billion toys the cookies might not be sufficient if the 1 in 5&#160;cookies are not sufficient energy intake santa could probably eat every cookie left for him which amounts to 266&#160;billion kilocalories in the period of 2&#160;days on a side note this amount of energy is enough to power several thousand homes for a year
