n in this comic randall is making fun of how oxygen deprivation can lead to reduced mental acuity in this case the mental clarity of the researchers devolves as they approach the high altitude telescope leading to juvenile and almost intoxicated behavior dizziness lightheadedness impaired judgment and euphoria are symptoms of oxygen deprivation or hypoxia those researchers would benefit from having a written list or plan developed while they were still functioning at peak mental acuity note that high altitude does not lead to severe effects as described in the comic iodine cells are used for wavelength calibrations of high resolution rv spectra between 501 and 610&#160;nm note that the phrase low oxygen refers to the lower partial pressure of oxygen at altitude the proportion of oxygen at high elevations is still approximately 2/9ths of the atmosphere the same as at sea level the altitude sickness is caused by lowered atmospheric pressure which leads to smaller amount of oxygen actually delivered pushed into bloodstream the title text refers to a laser guide star a device for focusing telescopes by making artificial reference points in the sky the reference points are created by shooting a powerful laser into the sky the concern of the astronomer in the comic is that an imagined star cat may be attracted to the laser in the same way that cats playfully chase laser beams projected on surfaces cats' reactions to laser pointers was previously explored in 729 laser pointer
