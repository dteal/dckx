n ontology is the study of being reality and existence the ontological argument is an attempt at proving the existence of god through reasoning about the nature of being megan's statement in the comic is likely a reference to what is considered the first ontological argument that of 11th century philosopher anselm of canterbury his argument starts by defining god as that than which nothing greater can be conceived another step in the argument is that you can conceive of such a being even if you don't believe it exists another step is the statement that a being of which one can conceive and which exists is certainly greater than a being of which one can conceive and which does not exist the comic makes fun of anselm's ontological argument by extending to absurdity the claim that a being who exists is greater than one who does not exist therefore god must exist a god who can disprove the ontological argument must be greater than one who cannot disprove the ontological argument therefore the ontological argument proves the existence of a god that disproves it the comic also may be drawing an analogy to the omnipotence paradox the title text carries the absurdity a step further richard dawkins in his book the god delusion takes a similar approach in a parody of anselm's ontological argument that attempts to prove that god does not exist in dawkins' versionxe2x80x94borrowed from the australian philosopher douglas gaskingxe2x80x94god's greatness is demonstrated by his creation of the world a being that overcomes the great handicap of not existing and goes on to create the world is obviously greater than a being that exists who creates the world therefore god who by definition is that than which nothing greater can be conceived must not exist a rather more famous parody is gaunilo of marmoutiers' where he argues for the existence of a maximally great island when taking into account the comic with this argument it seems that we now know what happened to atlantis not all ontological arguments for the existence of god rely on the notion that a god that exists is greater than one that does not exist examples include the modal ontological argument from alvin plantinga or gxc3xb6del's ontological proof graham oppy an authority on ontological arguments here attempts to classify what exactly makes arguments ontological; he concludes that it is that they are a priori in nature he also classifies them into eight categories definitional conceptual modal meinongian experiential mereological higher order and hegelian this comic in particular the way megan and cueball are walking and its reference to theology greatly resembles the earlier comic 1315 questions for god
