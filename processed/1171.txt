n perl is a scripting language that makes heavy use of regular expressions which are good for dealing with large amounts of text quickly in the comic the man wearing sunglasses parodies the song 99 problems in which the rapper jay z says  if you're havin' girl problems i feel bad for you son  i got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one  in the comic however the rapper tries to solve his problems with perl's regular expressions and ends up only creating another problem for himself which is a reference to a famous quote by jamie zawinski whose name could also be shortened to jay z some people when confronted with a problem think 'i know i'll use regular expressions' now they have two problems this quote was revisited in 1313 regex golf program help is a common way originating with the gnu project to ask a program to show documentation on its usage and supported parameters; which for some program could include az command line argument flag so the command would read jayz in this case it is just an obvious play on the rapper's name jay is also an actual c program that is a compiler compiler for java but it doesn't have az flag this sort of problematically recursive self reference is reminiscent of comic 927 standards and 1739 fixing problems
