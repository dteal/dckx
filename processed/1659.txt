n in this comic science girl and another girl have just completed a tire swing a common makeshift swing is created by hanging a car tire from a length of rope typically tied to the branch of a tree as in the comic the other girl might at first look like she has hair like megan but not quite as she is revealed upon zoom in to have curly hair that they are rather small kids can be seen from the size of the tire compared to them they could be the same as the girls in the last pane of 1580 travel ghost in the second panel of this comic science girl muses that there are huge tire dumps filled with nothing but old tires that have no use in the last panel science girl continues that maybe they should use a tire from such a dump next time they make a tire swing the presumption is that perhaps they used a brand new tire or a tire from some other source this is confirmed by the other girl's response and also by the title text see below which makes it clear that the tire they used was in fact stolen from a guy's vehicle the last reply from science girl suggests the victim put up a fight and they had to take the tire by force so these two small girls actually fought an adult man over his truck and won the fight vehicle tires have a limited lifespan the natural end of their life is when the pattern of raised treads on the circumference of the tire which promote traction on wet roads are worn down to a point where they are no longer effective enough or after 6 10 years sunlight causes the rubber to degrade so the tire becomes prone to cracking and unsafe even if it appears to be in good condition tires can also become damaged in other ways such as puncture used tires are a notable ecological problem for a number of reasons eg their size the quantity produced their relatively short lifespan and the fact that they are difficult and slow to break down and contain a number of components that are ecologically problematic a tire swing represents a functional use for otherwise useless old tires the amount of tires it is estimated that 259 million tires are discarded annually makes them attractive targets for recycling more than half of used tires are ultimately simply burned for their fuel value which prevents them from sitting in landfills indefinitely but this may even be worse as it releases otherwise locked up carbon thus releasing this into the atmosphere and making global warming even worse the comic is thus clearly randall's attempt to draw attention to this huge ecological problem as he so often before has done with other climate change/global warming related comics climate change especially global warming is a recurring theme in xkcd so while this is not the joke of the comic it could be the point of it he also suggests another way to use old tires it should be noted that used tires are not necessarily safe to use as a kids' toy as they could become sharp/frayed along the edges and stones and other hard/sharp objects may have become stuck in the tires even going all the way through during its life span or worn thin enough to tear apart mid swing when the stresses on the swing material would be at their peak so tires bought for use as a swing may even be made from a new tire but not necessarily of the same solid type as those used for cars used tires reused for a swing should be inspected for the problems mentioned above the title text goes further suggesting that they actually stole the victim's entire truck possibly just to harvest the tire needed for the swing and that he unsuccessfully attempted to recover the truck so they probably did fight him he put up enough of a fight that they do not wish to fight him again so he at least survived further since the girls expect him to try again maybe recovering the truck with only three tires they apparently still have the truck one of the girls suggests that if they could find one of these tire dumps then they could take a tire from there make a new swing and then just walk or run away from the truck when the guy comes back letting him have it if he really wants it so bad the reason science girl made this swing could be that she wishes to become a cosmologist as a reference back her meeting a cosmologist on a tire swing in 1352 cosmologist on a tire swing  note that calvin and hobbes which have often been referenced in xkcd has done the same to calvin's father as the girls did to the guy though without the violence in a similar comic this was the first of two wednesday's in a row where randall used two children to make a reference to an environmental issue the second being 1662 jack and jill about fracking also with science girl
