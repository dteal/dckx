n megan and ponytail are in orbit while nanobots are devouring the earth in a swarm the nanobots stop after devouring 40% of the planet this is a take on the grey goo scenario in which self replicating nanobots destroy the earth while creating more and more of themselves non stop however the nanobots are only able to destroy 40% of the planet because 40% of the earth volume = # of ipv6 addresses x a few cubic microns without more ip addresses the nanobots cannot continue to replicate assuming that each nanobot must be individually addressable ipv6 supports approximately 34xc3x971038 addresses while the earth's volume is around 108321xc3x971012 km3 or 108321xc3x971039 xc2xb5m3cubic micrometre randall's guess on 40% of the planet would mean each nanobot is about 127331&#160;xc2xb5m3 which is still less than a few microns according to 1070 words for small sets this is a joke on the shortage of ipv4 addresses the only difference is that we are on ipv4 and the nanobots are on ipv6 1998 is when the ipv6 specification rfc 2460 was published and ietf is the internet engineering task force note that an april fool joke for ipv9 exists and would have guaranteed earth's doom in this comic's scenario
