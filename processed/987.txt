n this comic jokes about the common rant by teachers when they are annoyed by lazy or ignorant kids the comic comforts the kids who were subject to this xe2x80x94 by telling the students if they did reach their full potential they could instead of providing better essays and science fair projects possibly create a monster robot with 6 mechanical legs apparently able to pick up and throw cars and use machine guns and force fields the title text describes a parallel to the example in the strip using philosophy rather than engineering randall expresses frustration when his teaching gives underprivileged kids the intellectual skills needed to raise existential questions that bugs him his somewhat destructive solution is to put the students back on the broad road where they won't have time or peace of mind to think about philosophy
