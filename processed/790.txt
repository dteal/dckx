n in a product experiment two groups of people are given a certain pill or lotion some people are given the product to be tested while others the control group are given a placebo; nobody is told which group they belong to the control group acts as a norm for comparison against the others randall has messed with this process by giving lsd lysergic acid diethylamide to the control group lsd is a drug that causes hallucinations and distortions in the perception of time and space megan apparently a control is experiencing spiders in her hallucinations since the control group is supposed to reflect what normally happens this is indeed very confusing to the scientists while hallucinating in the comic megan is drawn as if she had 8 limbs just like spiders have 8 legs however given the scientists are confused this means that they must know which person is in which group this implies that the trial isn't double blinded which in and of itself would impact the veracity of the study in a properly double blinded study the scientists would not know megan was the control and would only dutifully record their observations alternatively this is simply an unexpected result for either group the title text suggests that in a different study this substitution was performed when the product being tested was itself lsd this led to the conclusion that lsd is no more likely to cause hallucinations than a placebo somehow implying that lsd is not a hallucinogen  we can only hope they were able to redo the test as in layman's terms nonsense must be wrong
