n this is one of the most romantic comics in xkcd  the heat from a lightning strike can fuse sand into glass when this occurs in nature hollow tubes called fulgurites are formed cueball uses this knowledge and a spark of handiness and ingenuity to create an entirely home made glass necklace for megan here is some inspiration to do it yourself the title text represents an answer to the logical question prompted by this comic which is would this actually work  the implied answer is yes but only for some value of 'actually work' this is a play on the phrase for some value of x used frequently in physics or mathematics when it's not necessary nor easy maybe not even possible to calculate a suitable value of x  for example if you supply energy to a flux capacitor could it turn a delorean into a time machine  the answer is yes if you have sufficient energy the 'x' in this case any sensible person would take randall's response to mean it most likely doesn't actually work but a romantic person who may be in love and thus not sensible might give it a try anyway it worked for cueball
