n the word hipster originally referred to counter cultural youth and jazz aficionados in the 1940s and 1950s before the hippie culture developed in the mid '60s recently however hipster has come to refer to in wikipedia's terms a subculture of young urban middle class adults and older teenagers that appeared in the 1990s the subculture is associated with independent music a varied non mainstream fashion sensibility progressive or independent political views alternative spirituality or atheism/agnosticism and alternative lifestyles following the hipster resurgence it became popular in many circles to hold hipsters in contempt citing their conformity to a subculture by rejecting mainstream culture and deliberate ie ironic indulgence in obnoxious things like moustaches and bad movies randall continues the arguably hypocritical meta complaining by showing more s curves that represent subsequent smaller backlashes self referentially including his own comic in that meta complaining there is a possible double meaning in the phrase tedious navel gazing by insecure people the word hipster also refers to low rise leg wear that sits at or below the hips often in conjunction with revealing shirts thereby exposing one's bellybutton the title text reveals randall's awareness that he's only perpetuating the meta complaining he's complaining about but he bats away this criticism by pointing out the facts of the situation the reader is not communicating with randall but rather most likely in an empty room while browsing the internet which would make their argument effectively pointless the title text may be a reference to a previous comic  525 i know you're listening
