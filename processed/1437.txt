n cueball and ponytail are applying for a large amount of grant money to find the higgs boson under scrutiny they have been forced to admit that they have lost the particle which had been previously found this is a humorous play on the term finding when applied to fundamental particles the common usage means to discover or observe the existence of a class of particles rather than to know the current location of an individual particle the higgs boson is an elementary particle that is predicted by a physical model of the universe the 'standard model' observing evidence that higgs bosons really exist is a key test of this model if a search for the higgs boson had failed to find evidence confirming its existence then the standard model would have been shown to be an incorrect description of reality finding the higgs boson was one of the main reasons why the large hadron collider lhc was built to create energies high enough for the higgs boson to become manifest the point is once evidence for its existence has been observed it is not possible to 'lose' the higgs boson in a way implied by cueball and ponytail in the title text the off screen questioner wonders why cueball and ponytail can't use the lhc to find the particle again the implication is that this would avoid spending another $3 billion their responses imply that the pair have already dismantled the lhc and converted its components into a death ray a particle beam weapon to be exact the ostensibly reassuring platitudes offered mimic those used to placate those who were worried about possible apocalyptic consequences of commissioning the lhc for instance the creation of black holes strange matter a vacuum bubble or proton eating magnetic monopoles the comment that the death isn't even very serious in the title text may be a reference to isaac asimov's i robot robopsychologist dr susan calvin tells supercomputer the brain not to worry about death that it wasn't a big deal when the robot is working on an equation relating to hyper drive the brain was able to deliver the solution since anyone using the hyperdrive would be briefly dead no longer exist but in the end they would arrive safe and sound this also implies that the death ray was only able to produce one death as opposed to the many deaths such a weapon could be expected to cause just as it is implied that the lhc only produced a single higgs boson which was subsequently misplaced in 401 large hadron collider the proton stream from the lhc was used to cause the eventual death of a helicopter
