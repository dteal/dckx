n this comic is about using a simple and unrelated trick to work around a problem instead of spending a long time solving the cause of the problem swap space is an area of a computer's hard drive reserved for use when the computer runs out of ram ideally ram + swap &gt;= max where max is the amount of memory the computer will ever try to use at the same time however some broken programs may keep requesting memory from the system until computer runs out of resources a memory leak or the system may be misconfigured to run more and more programs simultaneously rebooting the computer will empty the ram and swap space so resources can be reallocated but this only temporarily alleviates the underlying issue determining the root cause of the problem is often nontrivial it would take randall up to 10 hours to figure out why the server is running out of swap space and fix the problem alternatively randall could just take 5 minutes and plug the server into a light timer this attitude to problem solving is in contrast to the attitude shown in 974 the general problem timers like the one in the comic typically have four switches or notches per hour so using the timer would replace an unpredictable and indefinite loss of service with a regular 15 minute downtime event once a day also it can be scheduled during say the middle of the night when most users are sleeping to minimize disruption the correct method of scheduling a regular reboot would be using a cron task but perhaps the server is crashing in such a dramatic manner that cron or shutdown or init stops working the comic title alludes to this in that a hard reboot scheduled with an analog timer is more guaranteed to work than a soft one scheduled with cron if a memory leak is not present the problem might be fixable by simply increasing swap space; however if there is a more complex underlying issue this is the first step along the path of 10 hours of troubleshooting as a general stereotype the type of person who has a home server is probably also the kind of person who would start by 'just' increasing the swap size and before they know it has spent 10 hours completely engrossed in the challenge of fixing the problem see 349 success the subtitle reads why everything i have is broken this indicates that randall frequently finds himself doing non standard workarounds that temporarily solve a problem but may ultimately damage the system to the point of becoming nonfunctional indeed a kitchen/light timer used to cut power to a server overnight may affect the server's performance if it is in the middle of a process when the reboot happens alternatively this can be interpreted to mean that everything randall has is broken and held together by metaphorical duct tape the title text's first sentence reveals that randall is aware that looking further for a fix is futile the problem is caused by a bug which has already been analyzed and is known to be triggered by using the system in the very way randall is using it he may get around the bug by changing what the system does but then it would not provide the services he needs anymore it may also refer to bug trackers where someone found out and posted what causes the issue but the bug is marked as unresolved waiting or will not fix it is not clear why the title text refers to a kitchen timer while the comic itself refers to a light timer it might be a small error or it might be that randall just considers these to be two synonymous terms typically however a kitchen timer refers to an alarm that will go off rather than a timer that cuts power to a device like a light timer google image search suggests that contemporary light timers mostly have grounded three prong plugs and the sort of duct tape hacker who would schedule a daily reboot with a light timer probably wouldn't worry about grounding anyway the title text's second sentence refers to the fact that operating system bugs take a long time to be solved hence the solution of waiting a few years until i don't want that combination of things anymore humor in that sentence is found in the fact that readers will anticipate wait a few years until would be followed by the bug is fixed however randall is indicating that usually his needs change before the bugs get fixed or that he has very low confidence in that the bug will be fixed in time if ever this play on expectations is a common comedic trope
