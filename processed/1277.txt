n the comic is an attack on the problems with the philosophy of objectivism white hat explains to cueball a program he wrote the ayn random number generator which is a pun on ayn rand the name of a writer who created a philosophical system known as objectivism the joke is an attack on her philosophy which claims to be a completely fair mechanism for distributing resources but inherently favors those who start out with more resources or already in a position to acquire the resources it also has a strong overarching theme that people that believe in objectivism are inherently better than other people and thus deserve what extra resources can be acquired as with the ayn random number generator which claims to be completely fair and balanced but actually favors some numbers which white hat explains by saying that they deserve to come up more because they're inherently better now objectivists of course would challenge the above portrayal but the joke is in the end an attack on ayn rand's philosophies a more nuanced description is that objectivists believe that the primary aim of life is to maximise personal happiness in their view if some humans are born more capable of satisfying their desires than other people they deserve to reap greater rewards from life than others no matter the cost to those others as an aside biased random number generators exist they're called weighted random number generators and they have many practical applications when the programmer isn't lying about the number generator's function and output the title text identifies a group of people whose names match the regular expression /bplurandy+b&#160;2/i a step by step explanation of the expression  b is a word boundary matching anywhere there is a 'word character' next to a non word characterxe2x80x94punctuation digit spacing etc plurandy is a character class and will match any single character from the set inside the square brackets; adlnpruy means exactly the same the plus sign means one or more of the previous thing so plurandy+ matches one or many of the characters in that class one after the other &#160; a space followed by a question mark   means 0 or 1 of the previous thing so a space is optional the whole section in parentheses bplurandy+b&#160; translates to a word containing one or more letters all of which are in the set plurandy followed by an optional space the 2 on the end means to repeat the pattern so it must match exactly twice the slashes at each end mark out the pattern and the i at the end is an expression qualifier means it is case insensitive uppercase and lowercase match interchangeably  overall it matches two words separated by a space composed entirely of the letters in plurandy which is what all the names listed have in common      person   brief description    ayn rand   author best known for her novels the fountainhead and atlas shrugged    paul ryan   us politician known to have been influenced by the writings of ayn rand    rand paul   us politician also influenced by ayn rand's writings    ann druyan   author widow of carl sagan    paul rudd   actor screenwriter comedian    alan alda   actor best known for the role of hawkeye pierce in the tv series m*a*s*h played arnold vinick a fiscally conservative republican presidential candidate in the west wing    duran duran   new wave/rock band  as an aside if the entirety of the title text is matched against the regular expression it matches and duran instead of duran duran
