n a girl with a ponytail asks megan what life was like before the internet the girl obviously was born after the internet was invented megan responds that life was very boring without computers or mobile phones this comic appears to be a parody of the common complaint xe2x80x94 often done by elder people xe2x80x94 that life was better and more fulfilling in the good old days in that there weren't so many distractions and people could actually get things done that were meaningful the ages switch roles with the younger character being prepared to believe that life was more fulfilling before technology and the elder rejecting the proposition to megan even a more fulfilling and engaging life wasn't worth the price of what it meant to be bored in the days before smartphones and computers that could go online even though the ponytail girl says that she still experiences boredom in spite of having advanced technology to occupy her megan assures her that her version of boredom is nothing like what those in the pre internet days had to endure again this is a reversal of the typical exchange in which a young person tries to insist that they still have social contact/get out and about/do worthwhile things in their spare time and the elder person responds not like we did the title text continues in this vein as megan talks about what people in her day resorted to doing when they were bored for lack of anything better to do they watched daytime tv daytime television consisted mainly of soap operas talk shows game shows infomercials and children's programming and is notorious for being in megan's words soul crushing to round off the comparison megan uses a modern day metaphor to express her extreme distaste for daytime television saying that she would rather eat an ipad than go through that again in other words modern day gadgets are so much better that she'd still have more fun if she were eating them than if she had to go without them megan might just be responding with the opposite of what she's expected to say in this dialogue in order to mess with the younger girl in reality life was neither likely to be noticeably more fulfilling or noticeably more boring without technology it was just life people are equally capable of wasting their time and of doing worthwhile things regardless of what age they live in and those who wax nostalgic about an older better time are liable to forget that this recalls the hedonic treadmill theory which states that people will always be at roughly the same level of happiness regardless of positive or negative events or technological advances in civilization
