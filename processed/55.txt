n randall is attempting to apply mathematics to the concept of love to no avail specifically he is attempting his normal approach which is a term used in mathematics for the method one typically uses to solve a certain type of problem however as love is not a well defined mathematical entity his normal approach is useless simply put he's saying he has found no way of describing love using only the tools of mathematics from the top moving left to right he tries the square root of love the cosine of love and the derivative of love with respect to x he then attempts to left multiply love by a 2x2 identity matrix and finally he defines a function of love as a fourier transform these are all normal approaches to solving certain math problems the message of the comic is that for someone who uses math to solve all their problems defining love is impossible  it also indicates that love is not always a rational phenomenon this comic has been made into a t shirt in the xkcd store with a laplace transform in place of the bottom integral
