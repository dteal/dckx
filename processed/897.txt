n in the united states all elevators are subject to building codes and must be inspected on a somewhat regular basis by city officials after the inspector runs his rounds the elevator's passing grade is noted in a certificate which will usually be dumped in a filing cabinet in the building office where the owner can forget about it and a placard is given to the elevator letting the passengers know where the certificate is usually the aforementioned building office this comic is portraying a scenario which supposedly never happens no one is ever actually interested in seeing the elevator's certificate and nobody gets this excited about going to a building office so as the caption humorously suggests many elevators start using the placards for elevators that have not been inspected no one cares enough to go to the building office and search the files for the certification and as the title text says even inspectors themselves get bored before they can get to the building office the moral of this comic is if you see an elevator with a notice that says that the elevator inspection certificate is on file you do not really know whether the notice is true and so building owners use the certificates as substitutes for the bother and expense of actually getting their elevators inspected the industry tip relates to the protip category
