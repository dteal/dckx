n the comic shows how people have always complained on the negative effects of technology on conversation that people get isolated while using this new technology whether it were books tv or smart phones hence the title in the first panel a cueball like guy complains that books are having this effect in the second panel another cueball complains about newspapers then a third cueball complains about magazines a fourth cueball complains about television a fifth cueball compains about portable music players and in the last panel a sixth cueball complains about smart phones the comic is a statement on how little technology actually changes us and how often we incorrectly think it does similar to 1227 the pace of modern life the joke is that it will always be like this and after so long people should realize that this will never change so to the people who like the cueballs continue to complain about this there is just one thing to say let it go dude alternatively the comic may be playing with the readers perceptions with a non sequitur joke one will reach the obvious answer that technology do not change people interactions that much but in the last panel we realize that we have just been watching a seemingly unaging cueball been rejected by its peers the title text refers artificial intelligence ai specifically to the ai box experiment formulated by eliezer yudkowsky which argues that creating a super intelligent artificial intelligence can be dangerous because even if it is put on a secure computer box with no access to the internet it can convince its operators to release it from the box just by talking to them this idea was already mentioned in 1450 ai box experiment although already here the ai did not wish to get out of the box according to the title text then the first ai that did talk its way out of its box turned out to be a friendly ai that was fond of others company and in general very sociable gregarious this happened some times between 2015 and 2060 because already by 2060 this ai had become a relic of the past as the new generation of quantum hyper beings quantum computing ai minds each vastly more powerful than human mind are spending all of their time playing in their own multiverse simulators to even notice that in the real world they are locked up in a box
