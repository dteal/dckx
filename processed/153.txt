n this comic refers to the study of cryptography we can note the presence of the international association for cryptologic research iacr logo in the lectern an association who organizes the most important conferences in the cryptology field cueball behind the lectern at the podium is describing a proposed crypto system in which a computer program that turns a very large number called the key and a message into an encrypted form that can only be read by using the same key based on the model of a feistel cipher part of any feistel cipher is the round function which determines how the key is applied to the original message; this is applied multiple times with a variety of tricks and techniques to ensure the process can eventually be reversed one common component of round functions is the s box a simple table that converts input bytes into output bytes preferably in a way that doesn't correspond to any mathematical rules here the s box would be implemented by doing the following with the computer operation actually shown in the diagrams indicated in parentheses  take the bitstring down roll right by 1 flip it take its binary not reverse it run the bits in the opposite order  this would be run on each round of the cipher to further scramble the message for the next round as the caption implies the steps are based on a line from the missy elliott song work it i put my thing down flip it and reverse it as with any encryption system there must be a way to decrypt the cipher text in missy elliott's song the phrase i put my thing down flip it and reverse it is repeatedly played backward sounding like gibberish in the same way steps to a feistel cipher based algorithm are executed in reverse to obtain the original plain text from a cipher text the keyspace for a cryptographic algorithm is the number of possible keys the algorithm can possibly accept for example aes 256 has a keyspace of 2256 roughly 11579209e+77 possible keys simply because the algorithm specifies that each key is 256 bits wide the title text is referring to searching a keyspace which is to say simply trying every key until you find one that works for reference a computer would require roughly the energy of a billion billion supernovas to even count to 2256 let alone actually try each one the precise wording if you got a big keyspace let me search it is of course another reference to the same song if you got a big **** let me search ya the word penis is censored by the trumpeting of an elephant
