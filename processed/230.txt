n cueball presumably in class decides that the subject of optimizing routing algorithms is not important in the larger context of life and love however he later realizes while in bed with megan that there is a flaw in the proof presented and suddenly wants to focus on the mathematics again in a humorous reversal of his position about what is meaningful in graph theory a hamiltonian path is a path that connects all the vertices nodes and passes through each one exactly once think connect the dots with rules a hamiltonian cycle is a hamiltonian path such that the final vertex is adjacent to the initial one intuitively it begins and ends with the same vertex but recall that paths are required to only pass through each vertex once the presenter is using graph theory to optimize a routing algorithm by solving a hamiltonian path problem cueball's realization is that the proof he had followed in part actually requires a hamiltonian cycle not just a path so the presenter's proof of the existence of a hamiltonian path is insufficient to solve the problem the title text plays on a dual interpretation of bidirectional just as any graph cycle can be traversed in two directions a change in perspective can be traversed in two directions from mathematics to love and then from love to mathematics
