n megan cueball and ponytail are observing the results from a gravitational wave detector see details below this comic came out on the day that the first direct observation of gravitational waves was publicly announced on 2016 02 11 the actual event was recorded five months before on 2015 09 14 but it was not reported publicly before they were sure it was a real signal it seems that randall knew in advance about this announcement because this comic was published on a thursday not following the normal publish schedule to coincide with the announcement and there were no other comics released friday that week the altered schedule could be viewed as a meta reference to the warping of spacetime that scientists knew there might be an announcement on the way and more details for the interested can be seen in these two videos from space time have gravitational waves been discovered and ligo's first detection of gravitational waves see also their follow up the future of gravitational waves this is the second time within a month that a new astronomical announcement of something discovered months before the actual announcement has resulted in a related comic the first being 1633 possible undiscovered planets  from the patterns in the gravitational waves detected by this instrument it might be possible to guess the nature of the event eg two bodies with dissimilar masses circling a fixed point two bodies with equal mass circling each other collision of two massive bodies etc it might also be possible to triangulate the location of the event based on these two facts the location and nature of the event we might be able to determine which astronomical bodies caused this event and the status of those bodies afterwards thus it provides an additional medium to observe the universe in addition to telescopes observing all kinds of electromagnetic radiation this new medium might enable us to observe properties that we couldn't observe with the rest of our observation instruments however the scientists in this comic appear to be receiving more than the expected signals from black hole collisions they also receive gravitational spam messages such as invitations from linkedin a mortgage offer and an announcement of a social meet up rather than observing astronomical events see table below there is also a joke on the social meet up's use of the word local group because the 'local group' is also the technical name for the group of galaxies containing the milky way it is not clear if these so called events are causing gravitational waves to be generated or if something perhaps an alien civilization is encoding spam messages in gravitational waves it is plausible that aliens are using gravity waves to encode their messages as we do something similar with electromagnetic waves to encode and send our messages however it would take an extremely advanced civilization to achieve gravity wave encoding it requires the controlling of orbits and oscillations of super massive bodies like the sun or more likely bodies ten times more massive than it for example the first event detected both in this comic and in real life was a merger of two black holes of roughly 30 solar masses each the title text makes the speculation that something is sending spam encoded in gravity waves seem more plausible as it follows up with a joke that the message senders have gone to such a length that they caused the most energetic event recorded ever perhaps on the scale of a few supernovae or black hole collisions one of the scientists is so impressed with this effort that he suggests that they actually post a reply but one of the other person declines with a nah as you should always do with spam else you will just encourage the sender by making it clear that there actually is a receiver on this address randall may have been referring to the fact that the detected event had a power output equal to 50 times that of the entire visible universe in 1365 inflation gravitational waves are also mentioned
