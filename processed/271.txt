n this is a parody of the short documentary powers of 10 which can be found here as in the documentary the comic features a man and a woman having a picnic on a blanket in the documentary the apparent distance from the scene and thus the zoom level gradually changes by a factor of ten every ten seconds hence the name powers of 10 1 10 100  in the comic powers of one are used since all powers of 1 are 1 the image doesn't change at all showing a series of identical images the title text notes that this idea may seem profound or zen which is commonly used in american slang to mean profound but is not upon scrutiny
