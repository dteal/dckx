n after someone plays a game enough various instincts develop one might be ready to push the right button when a right arrow comes up on screen one might learn the tricky sequences of moves needed for a situation in the game and find oneself doing them in another game in a similar situation or as in this case one might get used to pushing a giant ball around trying to collect smaller objects and try doing so with your car when the game's themesong starts playing  in the game katamari damacy the player has to grow an initial object by rolling over smaller objects in the playfield which become attached to it growing the object and making it larger and larger as the conglomeration of objects gets larger bigger things in the environment will begin to attach to it allowing it to grow further how big the player can get this conglomeration of objects or katamari determines how well the player does in the game as is also mentioned in 83 katamari when katamari damacy's theme song comes on in the third panel cueball begins acting out the game's premise and drives his car into a mailbox which looked smaller than his car trying to get it to attach this doesn't work so well outside of the game  the title text implies that music used in the game guitar hero is equally hazardous when driving anyone who's become accustomed to rocking out on a fake guitar to a particular song could find themselves involuntarily playing the air guitar when said song comes on the radio unexpectedly randall is pointing out that guitar hero induced spontaneous air guitar performances are not safe activities while driving alternatively one may try to hit all incoming objects in an attempt to mimic hitting strings of notes as they move down the fretboard which would be immediately more disastrous the theme song from katamari damacy is also mentioned in 851 na
