n there is an oft stated urban myth that men think about sex every seven seconds see for example this bbc article where they say that a more realistic number is 19 times in a waking day ie once every 50 minutes in this comic cueball is a sociologist and the thought bubbles show his train of thoughts regarding this myth first of all he flatly denies that it could be true and progressively his thoughts move to the effects if it were true and then cueball considers how it would even be studied the title of the comic every seven seconds hints strongly that this is the subject he is thinking about and this is subsequently confirmed both in the caption and in the title text the setup is that thinking about sex every seven seconds would be dysfunctional and unproductive in addition to making working social interactions and etcetera nearly impossible as explained by the sociologists thoughts the punch line is that thinking about how ridiculous it is to think about sex every seven seconds every seven seconds is just as dysfunctional and unproductive even if the thought time is spent refuting the original notion as understood in third person the irony of the comic is that in thinking every seven seconds about how impossible it would be for men to think about sex every seven seconds the sociologist is in fact thinking about sex every seven seconds albeit in a roundabout way in the title text the narrator randall or cueball the sociologist says he thinks about how implausible it would be to have sex every seven seconds several times a year see alternate interpretations below in the title text the narrator's statement leaves some meaning up to interpretation  every few months i think about sex every seven seconds in one day ie 8200 times that day and how weird and implausible having intercourse would be implying that narrator's sex life is not very active  every few months i think about sex every seven seconds and how weird and implausible having intercourse every seven seconds would be having sex every seven seconds is implausible  every few months i think about the statistic that men think about sex every seven seconds and how weird and implausible it would be an even more realistic take on the main comic's topic  every few months i think about sex every seven seconds and how weird and implausible such an assertion would be this interpretation is a bit paradoxical because it implies that the narrator finds himself thinking about the very thing he dismisses as a possibility to think about so often  every few months i think about sex every seven seconds and how weird and implausible it would be the narrator probably randall thinks about how implausible he finds the premise of every seven seconds every few months
