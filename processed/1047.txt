n this comic lists some approximations for numbers most of them mathematical and physical constants but some of them jokes and cultural references approximations like these are sometimes used as mnemonics by mathematicians and physicists though most of randall's approximations are too convoluted to be useful as mnemonics  perhaps the best known mnemonic approximation though not used here by randall is that pi is approximately equal to 22/7  randall does mention and mock the common mnemonic among physicists that the fine structure constant is approximately 1/137  although randall gives approximations for the number of seconds in a year he does not mention the common physicist's mnemonic that it is pi times 10^7 though he later added a statement to the top of the comic page addressing this point  at the bottom of the comic are expressions involving transcendental numbers namely pi and e that are tantalizingly close to being exactly true but are not indeed they cannot be due to the nature of transcendental numbers  such near equations were previously discussed in 217 e to the pi minus pi  one of the entries though is a red herring that is exactly true   randall says he compiled this table through a mix of trial and error mathematica and robert munafo's ries tool  ries is a reverse calculator that forms equations matching a given number the first part of the title text notes that jenny's constant which is actually a telephone number referenced in tommy tutone's 1982 song 867 5309/jenny is not only prime but a twin prime because 8675311 is also a prime twin primes have always been a subject of interest because they are comparatively rare and because it is not yet known whether there are infinitely many of them  twin primes were also referenced in 1310 goldbach conjectures  the second part of the title text makes fun of the unusual mathematical operations contained in the comic  pi is a useful number in many contexts but it doesn't usually occur anywhere in an exponent even when it does such as with complex numbers taking the pi th root is rarely helpful  similarly e typically appears in the basis of a power forming the exponential function not in the exponent this is later referenced in lethal neutrinos     thing to be approximated  formula proposed  resulting approximate value  correct value  discussion   one light yearm  998  9227446944279201  9460730472580800 exact  998 and 698 are sexual references   earth surfacem2  698  513798374428641  510072*1014  998 and 698 are sexual references   ocean's volumem3  919  1350851717672992089  1332*1018     seconds in a year  754  31640625  31557600 julian calendar 31556952 gregorian calendar  after this comic was released randall got many responses by viewers so he did add this statement to the top of the comic page lots of emails mention the physicist favorite 1 year = pi x 107 seconds 754 is a hair more accurate but it's hard to top 3141592's elegance pi x 107 is nearly equal to 31415926536 and 754 is exactly 31640625 randall's elegance belongs to the number pi but it should be multiplied by the factor of ten  using the traditional definitions that a second is 1/60th of a minute a minute is 1/60th of an hour and an hour is 1/24th of a day a 365 day year is exactly 31536000 seconds the for rent method approximation until the calendar was reformed by pope gregory there was one leap year in every four years making the average year 36525 days or 31557600 on the current calendar system there are only 97 leap years in every 400 years making the average year 3652425 days or 31556952 seconds in technical usage a second is now defined based on physical constants even though the length of a day varies inversely with the changing angular velocity of the earth  to keep the official time synchronized with the rotation of the earth a leap second is occasionally added resulting in a slightly longer year    seconds in a year rent method  525600 x 60  31536000  31557600 julian calendar 31556952 gregorian calendar  rent method refers to the song seasons of love from the musical rent the song asks how do you measure a year one line says 525600 minutes while most of the rest of the song suggests the best way to measure a year is moments shared with a loved one   age of the universe seconds  1515  437893890380859375  4354xc2xb10012*1017 best estimate; exact value unknown     planck's constant  1/30xcfx80e  668499014108082*10xe2x88x9234 rounded  662606957*10xe2x88x9234  informally the planck constant is the smallest action possible in quantum mechanics   fine structure constant  1/140  000
