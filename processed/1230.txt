n this comic plays upon the difference between reading a polar coordinate plot and the more common cartesian coordinate plot the graph purports to show the certainty in the viewers mind that it is a clockwise polar plot as a function of time if seen as a cartesian plot the y vertical axis represents 'certainty' while the x horizontal axis represents 'time' each point on the plot is represented by two coordinates the x value and the y value as time increases we move to the right and see the initial certainty of 50% decreases gradually to zero that is after a certain amount of time we are certain that it is not a polar plot in a polar plot each point on the plot is also located by two values but in this case they are the radius the distance from the origin and the angle between the radius and an arbitrary starting line  here the radius represents 'certainty' and the angle to the vertical represents 'time' in this view we see that as time increases as we move clockwise around the plot the initial certainty the same 50% now increases to a final value of 100% that is after a certain amount of time we are certain that it is a polar plot the intended joke seems to be that the graph is an exercise in confirmation bias whichever type you initially hypothesize is correct that view will be confirmed by investigation this is because the two different views are both correct the graph can equally be considered a cartesian or polar plot this is somewhat counter intuitive throughout the graph the sum of the two probabilities is 100% ie polar observer's certainty that the graph is polar + cartesian observer's certainty that the graph is polar = 100% the shape of the graph appears to be in clockwise polar form rt=100/1+cost if the reader is open minded they would never reach certainty 0% / 100% depending on how you read the graph because there isn't enough information to clearly decide either way the title text is a joke that if you are unsure how to label any two axis two dimensional graph you can just say it represents the 'coordinates of the ants crawling across my screen as a function of time' and nobody could then argue with your data hey that's the path they walked
