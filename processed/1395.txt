n in this comic we see beret guy walking in from the left as cueball is sitting on a couch typing on a laptop on his lap with its power cord unplugged instead of connecting it to the wall socket beret guy picks it up and blows air into the loose end of the cord as if inflating a balloon xe2x80x94 and the laptop inflates it then floats away making cueball grab for it as beret guy casually walks away while it is not possible to inflate a laptop like this nor to inflate anything by blowing down a power cord beret guy has previously demonstrated supernatural abilities with power cords such as in 1293 job interview in theory human breath should not be buoyant enough to lift anything in an atmosphere of ordinary air  because humans are warm blooded human breath is slightly warmer than the surrounding air and therefore has slightly fewer molecules per unit volume  however because human breath has much higher levels of carbon dioxide mw=44 than ordinary air average mw=29 and somewhat lower levels of diatomic oxygen mw=32 human breath has a higher average weight per molecule this is also true of hot air balloons but they operate at much higher temperatures than human breath and are therefore able to obtain a slight amount of net buoyancy there is a standard cartoon convention that inflating something with breath nonetheless makes it lighter than air also given beret guy's many manifestations of inexplicable phenomena it is not too far fetched to believe his body is in fact excreting some form of lighter than air gas similar to the character rigel on farscape who could fart helium    the title text involves some jokes on unix systems on unix everything is a file; even most of the hardware can be referenced by a virtual file these virtual files usually are in /dev or another virtual filesystem like /sys or /proc while /dev/input really exists and points to the input system mice keyboards gamepads etc /dev/inside doesn't gzip is a common tool to compress files the first joke is to compress the air inside the laptop with the command gzip /dev/inside in order to deflate the laptop back to normal size it is a pun with the literal meaning of deflate which is also the deflate algorithm used by gzip compressing files is also called deflating another joke is piping the act of using the output of one operation as the input to another as the output of the gzip command would be compressed air a physical pipe could be used to direct the air somewhere useful the output of a command can also be redirected to a file since the hardware is a file the suggestion is to direct the air to /dev/input which in this case means the keyboard to clean it similar to compressed air dusting cans the complete command would be gzip /dev/inside &gt; /dev/input as this might cause a spray of unpleasant detritus compare 237 keyboards are disgusting the reader is advised to avert their eyes
