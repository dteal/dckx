n linear regression is a method for modeling the relationship between multiple variables in the simplest case it can be used for two variables wherein the model determines a best fit line through a scatter plot of the datasets together with a coefficient of determination usually denoted r2 or r2 when only two variables are included in the regression r2 is merely the square of the correlation between the two variables r2 is a number between 0 and 1 that indicates how well one variable can be used to predict the value of another a value of 1 means perfect correlation while a value close to 0 indicates a weak relationship between the variables a constellation is the region of sky containing an asterism; an asterism is a pattern created by linking the apparent positions of stars as seen in the sky from earth strictly speaking randall's rexthor is an asterism although constellation is used informally in place of asterism by even seasoned astronomers different civilizations have recognized different constellations the modern iau for example lists 88 official constellations and one could create their own constellations by connecting assorted points in this comic a set of data has had linear regression and some form of statistical analysis applied to it indicating that there is low correlation between the two the data points are so widely scattered that as noted in the comic it is easier to connect the data points in a constellation like pattern than it is to determine whether the correlation is negative or positive without looking at the trendline of course because of this randall suggests we should be suspicious of any conclusions drawn from this data the comic is somewhat misleading since the data in the graph actually has an r2 of 002 only a third of what randall claims  an example of published research with an r2 of 006 where the association in the graph is noticeable if not strong can be found here figure 2 has r = 025 which corresponds to r2 = 006 in addition it is hard to see the association in the comic's graph because relatively few points are plotted in a data set with 1000 observations and r2 = 006 any association between the two variables would be quite clear rexthor the dog bearer could be a spoof on thor a norse god who wields a hammer   by replacing his hammer with a dog and adding rex an archetypal dog name but also meaning king as in king of the dinosaurs t rex randall may have created a comical dog bearing version of thor but it could just as well be an image of the dog king rexthor the 95% confidence interval in statistics is such a range of an estimate that the probability of the real value the estimated population parameter to lie inside the range is at least 95% the confidence interval is a standard method to provide evaluation of the estimation error in statistics on the right panel the resulting estimate seems to be a drawing so the 95% confidence interval would be a set of all drawings derived from the sample such that the probability of the right drawing to be among them is at least 95% according to the title text among these drawings you can find a cat and a teapot as well so we can't be 95% confident that a dog exists in the data the teapot may be a reference to russell's teapot or possibly to the teapot asterism in the constellation sagittarius alternatively is is just because the dog actually looks more like a teapot than a dog and randall noticed this and added it in the title text in the latter case the two first suggestion is just another example on how humans see patterns also where there are none to find like those of pareidolia mentioned in 1551 pluto
