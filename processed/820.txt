n this is the second of three five minute comics randall posted during a week in november 2010 the introduction to the comic explains everything you need to know about the circumstances behind it  randall obviously made more than three of these five minutes comics and one of them was published later for a short period of time by a mistake but an android xkcd browser picked it up while it was on line and saved it since then it has been added to explain xkcd so here is a complete list of all four comics in the entire five minute comics series  819 five minute comics part 1 820 five minute comics part 2 821 five minute comics part 3 five minute comics part 4  here is a list with explanations for each of the small comics  the first comic pokes fun at improbable conspiracy theories the grassy knoll is a location famous among conspiracy theorists who believe it to be the location of an unknown accomplice in the assassination of john f kennedy  it turns out that somehow this will all lead up to a theory that perfectly explains the september 11 attacks  when a woman described as having a glow about them it's usually just a vague sentiment of attractiveness specifically during pregnancy which here very suddenly reaches its conclusion as a baby is unceremoniously plopped into the world  cogito ergo sum is philosophical statement in latin formulated by renxc3xa9 descartes translated as i think therefore i am descartes wanted to build a philosophy from scratch starting with something he could be absolutely certain of cogito ergo cogito is latin for i think therefore i think this can even beat cogito ergo sum in uncontroversiality; it is a tautology which is why cueball describes it as playing it safe  the comic on the far right is a reference to trick or treating a major part of the modern halloween holiday  children go from door to door saying trick or treat  the trick is a non serious threat to play a trick on the person if no treat is provided but see also mischief night   normally the person at the home then gives them candy a treat as a response  here megan instead plays a trick on them magically filling one of the candy bags with blood  to bail out of a plane means to escape the plane usually via the cockpit's eject mechanism to bail out a boat means to manually drain water coming onto the ship with buckets the pilots here have confused the two although if a plane was somehow taking on a large amount of water bailing out that water would be a reasonable course of action  sometimes tv shows will tell true stories while playing up the drama angle for ratings purposes in these cases they will often air a notice similar to the following program is a dramatization of real events before the show to indicate that the story they're about to tell is true albeit not as a literally accurate retelling of events here the disclaimer is technically true although the events are normally devoid of any drama whatsoever to add some cueball screams for no reason  black lights are a kind of lamp that filters out sub purple light this means that the only light it gives off is a small amount of purple light plus plenty of ultraviolet light ultraviolet light is invisible to humans but it is noticeable in a few ways; it hurts the eyes which is why it's hard to focus on things under a black light; it causes sunburns although the amount given off by a black light is far too insignificant to do this in a realistic time; and it causes a fluorescence reaction in semen some food stains and dust making them appear to glow which is why the robes look dirty as such a blacklightsaber would indeed be a bad idea it also causes a fluorescent reaction in several types of cloth most notably white cotton which is why it has been used in discothxc3xa8ques because of the way people in white t shirts will light up  interestingly there is a black lightsaber in star wars canon; a unique one of a kind weapon known as the darksaber   most judicial systems have a jury a panel of impartial laymen that primarily determines the guilt or innocence of a suspected criminal ladies and gentlemen is a formal way of addressing a crowd and so cueball addresses the jury as ladies and gentlemen of the jury  however it turns out the jury consists only of women so the gentlemen part is not needed this poses a problem to cueball's defense which apparently relied on somewhat sexist tactics this sadly is not too uncommon in real life  the commander's first line is a line from star wars episode iv a new hope in the original film the commander was cut off by darth vader using the force to strangle him delivering the rebuttal i find your lack of faith disturbing  instead of belief in the force as in the movie the ancient religion referred to here is actually wicca a modern pagan religion with two deities that is most notable for practicing magic and is related to voodoo so naturally darth vader puts a hex on the commander's family the title text notes that modern wiccans don't really practice the whole putting hexes on people thing which is true episcopalianism probably refers to the episcopal church of the united states which was founded during the american revolution to replace the church of england in the colonies
