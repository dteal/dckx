n at 530 am one's sleep deprived mind sometimes comes up with things that seem like nonsense later none of the twelve panels in this comic seem to have any correlation with one another each one being its own story and none of them really make any sense it is unknown whether randall really wrote this comic while awake at 530 in the morning or if he wrote it while completely alert and is trying to pass off his rejected ideas by saying what one's mind may experience when trying to process information at an hour when the person is not used to being awake
