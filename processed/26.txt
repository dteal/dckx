n a fourier transform is a mathematical function often used in physics and engineering the theory is that any line graph can be represented as the sum of a bunch of sine waves of different frequencies with each frequency having a different amplitude the most obvious application is in analysing a sound recording in terms of the different frequencies of sounds used so for any line graph you can produce another graph of the frequencies and their amplitudes to do this there is a function where you put in one graph and you get the second graph as output and this process of going from one to the other is a transform this function is actually shown in the third line of the comic 55 useless  unfortunately cueball has applied this transform to his cat although it seems to still be alive and possibly even unharmed it is clearly not in its familiar shape and it is not clear if this condition is permanent or not periodic components in the title text refers to the spikes in the graph  because sine waves repeat themselves as you go along the presence of large amounts of one particular sine wave in the fourier transform graph each spike shows that the overall result the initial graph is likely to have parts that also repeat themselves like a periodic function in other words the cat has repeating parts
