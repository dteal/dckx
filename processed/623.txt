n the oregon trail was an early educational video game that was designed to teach children about the trials and hardships faced by pioneering settlers the actual oregon trail was an overland track leading from missouri to oregon and in the video game the player started his or her journey in 1848 most players were grade school students the game was very popular and thousands of players played it monthly in their youthful wisdom most players brought the minimum amount of food and planned to hunt for their meals large animals bison bears etc were very easy and rewarding targets while smaller prey rabbits squirrels etc were harder to obtain and provided less food  the comic tries to document as though in a historical fashion what would have been the result if all the players had been real settlers who really had prepared for their journey on the oregon trail in that way with an unbelievably large influx of people all arriving in exactly the same year and all with no other supplies or sources of food the land would soon have been stripped bare all large game slaughtered for meat with hunger starvation and disease soon to follow dysentery in particular was very common in the original game and perhaps the most infamous way to die hence its listing as the most prominent epidemic the title text makes things rather recursive in this alternate reality thousands upon thousands of people fleeing from the overpopulated devastated oregon becomes the focus of another video game much like the oregon trail in our universe
