n a psychic is a person who claims to be able to access information that is beyond normal sensory perception through extrasensory perception this information may vary widely in scope and value ranging from archaeological to the ability to read minds cueball describes himself as such a person to which megan responds with disbelief because it is a bold and unsupported claim to prove his abilities cueball has megan think of a random number from 1 to 100 which he then guesses correctly to demonstrate his ability to read minds megan is amazed that cueball was correct but he simply dismisses her disbelief and wants to go back to pretending to lead a normal life the four panels are actually a setup to the real joke in this comic the final sentence spoken by a narrator it reveals that cueball has simply played a trick on megan and that anyone can repeat it the joke is that theoretically a person can guess a random number from 1 to 100 once in one hundred tries or 1% of the time according to the law of large numbers by playing this trick enough times on enough friends the trickster is statistically likely to get a number right eventually assuming the person whose number he guesses is not familiar with the trick it will appear as if the trickster is actually psychic should this happen the trickster can then play the joke out as he wants hence the it's totally worth it at the end the title text appeals again to statistics people are poor random number generatorsxe2x80x94eg being less likely to pick numbers at the extremes or exactly in the middle knowing this the 'psychic' could restrict his guesses accordingly improving his odds of guessing correctly
