n lisp is a computer programming language with simple highly regular syntax the language's most notable feature is that programs take the same form as the language's primary data structure the linked list this blurs the line between code and data and permits programs to inspect and even alter their own source code thereby opening up deep opportunities for metaprogramming lisp is also a functional programming language though not purely functional as some more recent languages are meaning that programs are expressed in terms which are simple elaborations or extensions of the lambda calculus a formal mathematical model of computation this gives programs written in functional languages such as lisp a distinctively abstract mathematical form that is commonly considered difficult to fully grok see 1270 functional the phrase a suffusion of blue is a reference to douglas adams' book the long dark tea time of the soul in it an i ching calculator calculates everything above the value of 4 is a suffusion of yellow in the comic cueball marvels at the fundamental and complete nature of the language of creation that he sees in his dream in the lisp programming language car is a primitive ie basic function which produces the first item in a list the line my god it's full of 'car's is a pun most likely referring to the movie 2010 the year we make contact the sequel to 2001 a space odyssey in the book 2001 a space odyssey when astronaut david bowman accidentally activates a star gate he exclaims as he enters it the thing's hollow xe2x80x94 it goes on forever xe2x80x94 and xe2x80x94 oh my god it's full of stars although he does not say anything in the first movie during the final sequence in the second panel cueball remarks that at once just like they said i felt a great enlightenment this is a reference to a pattern of observations among programmers and computer scientists that while lisp often seems alien or arcane xe2x80x94 even deliberately so even to experienced hackers even with repeated exposure over time xe2x80x94 truly understanding lisp in  a deep non superficial way results in a profound epiphany a sudden and abiding illumination wherein one's preconceived notions about computation and programming are fundamentally transfigured oftentimes over the course of a very short span such as during a single all day hacking binge lispers commonly describe the experience as being akin to learning programming for the first time again; daniel p friedman author of much ground breaking research and many popular introductory texts on lisp and programming language design described it as learning to think recursively and contended that thinking about functional computing is one of the most exciting things the human mind can do cueball's remarks about patterns metapatterns and the disappearance of syntax are reactions to the elegant simplicity of the lisp programming language in which it is relatively easy to build immensely sophisticated programs using simple recursive elaborations of structure this is fundamentally unlike the much more typical and common imperative programming languages in which programs are written as chains of instructions for the machine to follow god replies that the universe was actually hacked together with the programming language perl perl employs an idiosyncratic syntax which borrows liberally from a number of other languages although a versatile language often employed for assembling projects quickly the much loved programming perl introduces it as the language for getting your job done perl has a reputation for being ugly and inelegant partly as a result of its pidgin like fusion of many inconsistent language elements and code styles it was famously described as a swiss army chainsaw because it is very powerful but also unwieldy and unattractive by way of contrast to daniel friedman above larry wall the creator of perl criticised the highly cerebral lisp attitude toward programming with the words  by policy lisp has never really catered to mere mortals and of course mere mortals have never really forgiven lisp for not catering to them the joke is that the creator like many software developers was a bit rushed and chose to quickly throw together a working prototype rather than do the job right from the beginning; and concurrently that cueball thinking he has discovered an amazing and beautiful secret in the hidden world of lisp learns that in fact the real world is filled with ugly hacks and quick and dirty imperative code a possible hidden joke might be an oblique reference to greenspun's tenth rule when god replies with i mean ostensibly yes greenspun's tenth rule says that any sufficiently complex program written in another high level programming language will necessarily contain an imperfect undocumented slow and bug ridden implementation of about half of common lisp greenspun's tenth rule was meant to express the belief that common lisp a large full featured lisp dialect is so flexible and robust that any attempt to render any really sophisticated program in most other languages requires the programmer to expend extraordinary effort unwittingly reinventing in needlessly convoluted fashion features and systems that would be elegant and trivial in common lisp this explains why such a program might look or feel lispy to an unfamiliar observer and why the universe if viewed as such a program might look to mathematicians and scientists as though it probably has a beautifully simple mathematical basis even if in reality it was just hacked together with a bunch of ersatz special case rules the title text continues the analogy by suggesting that the theory of quantum mechanics was written in regular expressions regexes a complex language for pattern matching used heavily in perl regular expressions are often criticized as being a write only language that is a language so complicated in syntax that any significant program written in them cannot be understood by anybody often not even the original author documentation is essential to assist in the understanding of complex regular expressions the title text claims that at some point the documentation for quantum mechanics was lost which explains why quantum mechanics is so bizarre and counterintuitive
