n this comic is about astronomy and the your mom jokes that have become increasingly widespread in urban parlance beret guy is perusing a research paper which is presumably discussing dark flow an observed anomaly in the motions of the galaxies which some theorize is caused by an unobservable sibling universe or similarly super massive object beyond the edge of the visible universe cueball who is playing sees this as an opportunity to turn it into yet another your mom joke implying that beret guy's mother is fat but apparently beret guy's mother is dead or at least missing and he takes the joke seriously he looks toward the sky and wishes that his mom pulls harder so he could be with her the joke has been turned onto itself the title text is a continuation of beret guy's thoughts and refers to another piece of science phenomenon that has been observed in space the pioneer anomaly the pioneer 10 and pioneer 11 spacecrafts had been slowed down by an unknown force as they exited the solar system which he says is caused by the force of his love probably towards his mom
