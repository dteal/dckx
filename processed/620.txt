n cueball explains to megan that on saturn's moon titan the combination of lower gravity and a denser atmosphere make the act of flying simpler wings that are only capable of generating 9% of the necessary lift  on earth would allow one to fly if used on titan cueball has already put together the apparatus necessary to test this by using a pulley system to offset 91% of his weight he can recreate the environment for flight on titan his wings are a success and he uses them to fly around in a delighted fashion megan points out a fatal flaw his wings use hot glue which will soften and melt at high temperatures and black hat is waiting nearby with a powerful heat source a heat lamp naturally cueball falls when the hot glue fails icarus is a character in greek mythology who is known for his own self powered flight which ended when the wax holding his wings together melted and he fell to his death this supposedly occurred because he ignored instructions not to fly too close to the sun a tragic example of hubris xe2x80x94 extreme arrogance here black hat is bringing an artificial sun to icarus to recreate the tragedy in the title text randall asks that xkcd readers do not attempt to reproduce this the reason for this is explained here 254 comic fragment it could also simply be a media standard don't try this at home warning as there are legitimate dangers to flying around unprotected sufficient height and a sudden loss of one's wings could indeed result in death and deliberately causing someone to lose their wings and die or be injured would indeed get one arrested
