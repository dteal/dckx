n  examples of camouflaged cell towers   194x259px    this comic features a running theme in the xkcd comics beret guy's naive and/or odd ways of thinking in the beginning of the comic beret guy shows megan what he believes to be a tree and explains that it grew there because he placed magic beans in that spot yesterday this is a reference to the fable jack and the beanstalk where the protagonist plants several magical beans he acquired resulting in a beanstalk growing which ascends into the atmosphere megan however tells beret guy that the tree is actually a cell phone tower beret guy disagrees pointing out that it has branches to which megan tries to explain that this was in an attempt to make the towers look like trees she gives up however as beret guy has already begun climbing the tower later megan complains that her cell reception has disappeared beret guy responds by saying that he had to cut down his tree because there were scary giants with yellow helmets in it this mirrors again the jack and the beanstalk fable where the protagonist has to cut down his beanstalk to prevent the giant whose lands the beanstalk connects to from climbing down and chasing him in reality the giants were probably utility workers the title text suggests that over time trees will evolve to start looking more like cell phone towers in a form of mimicry in order to avoid people cutting them down mimicry is where a creature copies the appearance or behavior of another in order to confuse predators in this scenario the more defenseless trees attempt to mimic cell phone towers which have the defense of people not wanting to cut them down or they would lose cell service and likely a significant amount of money through fines and because of society's general respect for the property of others this is similar to the counting pine a tree in terry pratchett's discworld series that evolved to display its age with numbers on the outside in the bark in the hope that humans would not cut it down and count its rings of course now humans hunted it down trying to find a tree with numbers that would fit their house number instead thus quickly rendering the trees almost completely extinct see the tribute to terry in 1498 terry pratchett convergent evolution deals with multiple species acquiring similar characteristics to fulfill their role such as dolphins and sharks both having a streamlined shape to swim fast due to the species' common need to adapt to similar environments or tasks randall uses the term to describe the convergence in the appearances of cell towers whose design has evolved to include tree like branches and trees which he predicts will evolve to resemble cell phone towers each of these evolutions would be for the purposes of camouflage although the cell towers evolve by human design for purely aesthetic reasons and the trees would evolve naturally for self preservation this would therefore not be a true example of convergent evolution it more closely resembles batesian mimicry or the evolutionary process by which a species remains noticeable but treated as something it is not
