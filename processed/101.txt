n this comic plays on the homonymic relationship between miss to feel sad due to the absence of someone and miss to fail to hit xe2x80x93 in this case with a gunshot miss your loved ones is a question which would generally use the former miss however its use on the package for a laser scope implies the latter miss a sighting scope can be attached to a firearm to aid in aiming the weapon the addition of a laser improves the accuracy of the weapon by making it easier to aim consistently the model number rjx 21 does not appear to be a reference to anything and this comic is primarily a play on a common marketing technique of adapting a common saying to your own product by use of homonym or homophone; in this case it is perhaps an inappropriate use as one would not be expected to be aiming a firearm at their loved ones  in real life this would imply a serious family breakdown with extreme feelings of pain and revenge which is actually a tragically sad story not the normal fodder for a light hearted joke  the title text hammers it home with the dual use of the word miss as the writer wishes he had missed failed in his attempt to shoot someone so they would not miss them feel bad that they are not there
