n the save dialogue shows a download from 6522220253 an ip address that hosted javascript malware during a recent attack on the tor anonymity network with a very long file title many of the extensions used inside there indicate executable code; multiple file extensions are sometimes used to disguise a trojan program as a document you also see common download syntax for a pirated movie hackers likely included to appear malicious to anyone skimming but is actually a movie about hackers making it a benign reference rather than malicious it is described as _bluray_cam which contradicts itself _bluray would mean it was ripped from a copy on blu ray disc while _cam would mean it was copied by pointing a camera at the screen in the cinema _bluray_cam would probably indicate a search keyword stuffed fake copy; fake pirated media often contain viruses although this is more likely to be a problem with newer media before the first real pirated copy appears the url contains the path ~tilde/pub/cia bin/etc the first part is a public folder of a user named tilde which is also the name for the ~ symbol cgi bin is a common folder on a web server for server side executables randall changes the name to cia bin and etc is a standard folder for configuration files xe2x80x93 normally never accessible through a webserver the program initdll isn't executable at all it's a windows dynamic link library which can't be run standalone and is rarely referenced in urls even though such syntax is still being employed even on reputable websites google search or here at ebay indicating the webserver is a microsoft asp server the question mark indicates the start of a parameter list and in this case we have only one named file the save button is disabled; you can only click the cancel button this can be different when the server detects that you are using a secure https connection the complete content sent to the server starting with /~tilde and ending with outexe is exactly 256 characters long on html 3 specifications you have a limitation of 1024 characters whereas later html specifications don't have this limit; it just depends on the web server's capabilities but posting parameters directly at the url is still a worse choice the content of the parameter is shown here  __ underscore underscore xe2x80x94 used in the c programming language to denote that a symbol is really not for public consumption autoexecbat xe2x80x94 a file which is automatically run during startup on windows/dos operating systems and was often modified by viruses which added malicious code to be run on each boot my%20osx%20documents xe2x80x94 referencing the osx operating system %20 is a representation of a space in a url ie it reads as my osx documents installexe xe2x80x94 a typical installer rar xe2x80x94 a compressed archive file type ini xe2x80x94 a configuration file type tar xe2x80x94 a file archive popular in unix and unix like operating systems tar has been mentioned before doxc3x87x xe2x80x94 docx is an office open xml file ie a word processing format used by microsoft word 2007 and above but has no cedilla xc2xb8 the addition of a cedilla may be a reference to exploits that rely on rare characters being mistaken for more common ones that look similar such as the idn homograph attack phphphp xe2x80x94 a play on php files a kind of server based web page file type php originally stood for personal home page but was later redefined as the recursive abbreviation php hypertext preprocessor xhtml xe2x80x94 another web page file type tml xe2x80x94 stands for transducer markup language an xml based markup language that specifies how to capture time tag and describe sensor data xtl xe2x80x94 possibly a play on xhtml txxt xe2x80x94 a play on txt file types 0dayhack xe2x80x94 a reference to a zero day exploit overlaps with the next entry hackers_1995_bluray_cam xvid xe2x80x94 a reference to the 1995 hackers movie but pirated movies would either be a blurayrip/dvdrip or cam but not both at the same time unless you used a camera to record the blu ray movie as it played exe xe2x80x94 an executable file type used by microsoft windows scr xe2x80x94 a tag used by movie pirates to denote a 'screener' the dvd copy of films given to critics prior to theater release usually the highest quality available at the time rare and thus good bait for a virus laden download scr is also the extension for screensaver files really just an exe file with a different extension and one of the classical ways to distribute infected files lisp xe2x80x94 programming language msi xe2x80x94 an installation file used by microsoft installer lnk xe2x80x94 an extension used by microsoft windows for shortcuts the extension is normally hidden to the user lnk zda gnn xe2x80x94 references to link zelda and ganon important characters from the legend of zelda video game franchise wrbtobj xe2x80x94 a reference to the line of code dennis nedry used in jurassic park to shut down key systems o xe2x80x94 the extension for a linker file an intermediary created when compiling c code h xe2x80x94 the file extension of a header file in c code swf xe2x80x94 shockwave flash file type dpkg xe2x80x94 the debian package management although the package files use the file suffix deb app xe2x80x94 an application on mac os x operating system zip xe2x80x94 compressed archive file type co xe2x80x94 the top level domain tld for colombia but marketed as a global domain some countries use cotld for general use eg couk in the united kingdom but the tld gz does not exist and thus cogz is invalid gz xe2x80x94 a compressed file using gnu zip aout xe2x80x94 default filename when creating an executable on linux or other unix like operating systems if none was specified for the compiler  the title text suggests changing from http to https as if encrypting a suspicious file before downloading it is somehow better than downloading it unencrypted http hyper text transfer protocol and https hyper text transfer protocol secure are the two common protocols for getting web pages and web downloads http is the simple download whereas https adds an ssl encryption layer so the item being downloaded cannot be viewed unencrypted by anyone except the end recipient changing http to https is a common suggestion to improve security when browsing the web from an insecure network such as a public wifi hotspot to avoid surveillance or hijacking to a malicious website; google automatically switches to https for all mail accounts and is starting to do so with searches the end recipient will still get whatever nasties were in the original however xe2x80x94 encrypting it doesn't change the content at all the ip address referenced in the comic 6522220253 is currently being used by the shellcode of a javascript 0 day exploit for the tor browser bundle being run by the fbi to phone home over the clearnet 1 and de anonymize visitors to websites on freedom hosting that are serving child pornography 2 the title of this comic the mother of all suspicious files is a reference to the mother of all demos from douglas engelbart
