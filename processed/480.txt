n 'spore' is a game that was released in 2008 it was $50 when it first came out so many people could not afford it at the time spore starts you off as a small little water bug and when you become smart enough you leave the water for land and start growing to begin with the scale of your interest is thus very small as you are only concerned with your spot of water during the next two stages the scale grows to being the entire continent once you start building cities you get to view the entire planet the last stage and scale is space where you get to first travel your own solar system then the entire galaxy since cueball can't yet afford spore which is now only about $15 he instead is recreating the experience by playing older games starting off with small scale games in the comic cueball had just beaten the game 'populous' which is on a planet scale so now he can go on to the galactic scale with the game 'alpha centauri' the following three games could for instance have been played before the ones mentioned starting with 'simant' ant scale then moving up to 'the sims' human scale and then proceeding with 'simcity' city scale  the title text refers to the game not being able to run on the mac using a gma 950 which is a type of intel integrated graphics processor it was first supported in osx 104 it lacked hardware support for vertex shader 20 which some games required
