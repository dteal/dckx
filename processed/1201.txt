n integration by parts is an integration strategy that is used to evaluate difficult integrals by trying to find simpler integrals derived from the original it is commonly a source of confusion or irritation for students when they first learn it due to the fact that there is really no way to accurately predict the proper u/dv separation just by looking at an integral integration by parts requires patience trial and error and experience randall shows a somewhat complicated math problem and in an attempt to help simplifies it into a more compact integral this is the first part of performing integration by parts which involves the guessing having gotten it into integration by parts format he then leaves without describing the actual solution the general integral xe2x88xabu dv is equal to uv xe2x88xabv du and this is the more tedious part of the math and where problems will arise if you picked the wrong u and dv at the beginning the narrator makes a point of leaving here so we can't ask for help or complain if the choice of u and dv was wrong the title text points out that if the integral of x can be divided so that u = x and dv = dx and implying v = x then it leads to the result 1/2xxc2xb2 this implies the original integral was just xe2x88xabx dx and not needing integration by parts in the first place mathematics teachers and extreme math geeks will also cringe at this answer however since an indefinite integral requires an integration constant the correct answer is actually 1/2xxc2xb2 + c as randall hints the +c symbolizes that an indefinite integral can be shifted by any constant and still gets the same answer on the reverse derivative definite integrals specify a range that they're valid on and thus there is no need to add this constant
