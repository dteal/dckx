n a twitter bot is a program that can post automatically to twitter although twitter bots can be very elaborate a lot of people write simple bots for fun that simply engage in automated wordplay cueball thinks he'll write a twitter bot figuring out it won't be too hard the web searches he makes tell what happens next ie the bot balloons in complexity until it starts following its own goals and cueball no longer has any control over its actions this comic examines how a seemingly simple task can often balloon in complexity if all of the requirements are not understood while at the same time presenting the stereotypical scenario where an unassuming idea results in the accidental creation of malevolent ai which then attempts to destroy humanity the story as told by the web searches is as follows  how to write a twitter bot cueball has no idea where to start so he just searches for basic advice on writing generic twitter bots python twitter library the python programming language has a nice library that interfaces with the twitter api this does all the tricky work of authenticating the bot's identity and sending the messages so the user can concentrate on the fun parts machine learning machine learning is the basis of artificial intelligence cloud hosting while it's possible to host a twitter bot on your server you can also have it hosted by someone else such as amazon in order to take advantage of their powerful computers and robust internet connection bot troubleshooting cueball is having some trouble with his bot and is looking for some information about resolving the problem locked out of ec2 instance ec2 is a hosting service by amazon that allows users to run their code in the hosting server cueball was running his bot from ec2 but now he's unable to access his account he's searching for advice on how to regain access bot changed own password cueball is suspecting that the reason he can't access his amazon ec2 account is that the bot has changed the password without cueball's knowledge or consent since the bot was never programmed to change any passwords at all the fact that it has done so is pretty scary as one wonders what other things the bot is doing without being programmed for it how to fight a bot cueball is trying to physically fight the bot but he's apparently unsuccessful and the fight results in a loud boom and pew pew pew sounds the situation is scarier than before as it starts to resemble the killbot hellscape in 1613 the three laws of robotics cheap flights to australia cueball has completely given up the possibility of regaining control of the bot so he flees to australia instead randall lives in massachusetts usa so australia would be a far far away land for him  in the title text the  python flag enable three laws reference that the python language is known for having easy constructs to perform difficult tasks see 353 python in this case it is either assumed that or cueball is making yet another query to see if python has a configuration flag ie a boolean value which when set to enabled or true as opposed to disabled or false will cause the bot to follow isaac asimov's famous three laws of robotics this is a simple enough step and it might have been enough to prevent the killbot hellscape scenario like the rule is depicted doing in the top panel of 1613 the three laws of robotics it won't cause the bot to stop being in control however but if the bot is following the rules strictly it would not be allowed to even make cueball uncomfortable which he already becomes when it changes his password it is unclear if this message is something he actually desperately tries only searches for like the rest of the queries or something someone shouts at him that he should have done before creating the bot in the first place or the title text is simply randall's comment on his own comic like an idea to add that flag in python just in case
