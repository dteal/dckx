n following on from his attempts at networking beret guy the oddball of the xkcd cast conducts an interview for a programmer position at his mysteriously successful company much like most of beret guy's interactions with people beret guy is cheerful and upbeat yet indicates that he has at best a scrambled understanding of how people in this situation normally act because of this the job interview becomes increasingly bizarre starting with beret guy's assertion that the company headquarters is a real building he found implying that the building's reality might be in question he says his company makes phone accessories but then adds like apps and stickers two wildly different products in terms of both production and profitability he is strangely vague about both the position someone to write on our computers and the salary a bunch of paychecks then he mentions ghosts which is either a powerful disincentive from joining the company yet another sign that beret guy is mentally unsound or both the strip finishes with beret guy plugging a cord into an electrical outlet clumsily labeled soup which then implausibly actually starts dispensing soup most businesses do not function like this&#91;citation needed&#93; however this is a typical behaviour of beret guy see a similar example in 1395 power cord the title text makes reference to the biblical story of job pronounced with a long o to rhyme with globe who was put through many horrendous ordeals to test his faith in god this suggests that the interviewee will be taking on not a job experience but rather a job experience ie the job will be a horrendous ordeal other job interviews were portrayed in 125 marketing interview 1088 five years 1094 interview and 1545 strengths and weaknesses
