n this comic is divided into two parts the first two rows of panels and then the third one the first part demonstrates a failed attempt at communication  white hat notices a dangerous hole and thinks he should warn people about it the symbol of the triangle with the exclamation mark in it is widely used on warning sign and it means general caution  white hat encounters hairy and tries to warn him about the hole while hairy is wondering what white hat is pointing at not understanding what he says hairy doesn't understand the warning he continues to think without speaking now he thinks of a frustrated white hat hairy continues to only think of what he can see and now this is the fact that white hat is leaving as white hat leaves he is thinking about hairy's lack of understanding and about his silence  white hat encounters megan and is now so annoyed about hairy that he rather talks about his lack of communication than about the dangerous hole megan on the other hand tries to tell white hat about another dangerous hole if he continues to walk along white hat and megan pass each other white hat now thinks about both the silent hairy and the talking megan who both failed to understand him megan is just frustrated by the outcome of her encounter and thinks about white hat talking megan then meets hairy while they are both still thinking about white hat they now share their common experience of seeing white hat finally hairy talks they both continue towards the first hole unaware of it talking about white hat hairy is drawn without hair both here and in the next panel see trivia below megan and hairy fall into the first hole since it wasn't properly communicated to them white hat falls into the second hole since it wasn't properly communicated to him  the holes in the sidewalk are fairly deep about one person deep; unaware and careless people don't notice them when they come upon them which makes them symbolic of any problem or danger one can encounter in life and could avoid if properly warned or careful the second part demonstrates a much more successful attempt at communication  beret guy notices a dangerous hole and thinks he should warn people about it he even runs out of the picture to warn people as can be interpreted by the fact that he has reached further in the next panel than white hat beret guy finds cueball and tells him to come along cueball only sees beret guy stretching out his hand beret guy takes cueball's hand and leads him towards the hole cueball doesn't understand why as shown by the question marks in his thought bubble surrounding his thought of beret guy but follows beret guy anyway beret guy leads cueball to the hole and points it out for him finally both beret guy and cueball leave the hole thinking about the danger of it beret guy has managed to properly warn cueball about the hole  it is very typical for the character beret guy to succeed especially with something difficult where white hat fails the title text references the requirement that communication is a two sided process and just because you think you have made your point clear this does not mean that you have communicated the information to them if they failed to understand then it may as well mean that you failed to communicate and not necessarily that they are bad at listening and if you always encounter this then it is you who are confused about how communication works
