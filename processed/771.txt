n the actors on this stage are using language and technology from wildly differing time periods for example forsooth is from elizabethan times; grok is a word from the 1961 robert heinlein novel stranger in a strange land; jive is african american slang from the 1940s to the 70s; me hearties is popular 'pirate speak'; and ten four was popular during the 1970s cb radio craze put together the exchange roughly translates to do you truly understand what i'm saying my friends/we understand the characters also combine archaic weapons like a spear and a sword with a presumably modern handgun and a laptop adding to the growing heap of anachronisms randall's contention is that hundreds of years from now people will make similar errors that we do today when depicting historical items and language modern movies fiction and other forms of media that depict history often confuse terms items and equipment that were in one place and time period and place them in another but few people notice because to them all of it fits under the very broad category of old historical things only those with an interest in history really notice or seem to care thus following this trend in the future things like laptop computers and grok my jive will seem just as historical and old timey as a spear or the saying forsooth except to those who participate in such things like blogger reenactment festivals as mentioned in the title text for instance take a suit of full plate armor to most people plate armor is a medieval thing so thus when depicting king arthur a figure from 500 to 800 ad if he even existed at all one would and has put him in a suit of full plate because he is medieval and that is the stereotypical equipment of a medieval figure in actual fact plate armor only came about after 1350 quite literally centuries after any story about king arthur is set and it coexisted alongside firearms for a very long time king arthur would have worn chainmail but all of this would be lost on an average person watching a movie about king arthur to whom chainmail and full plate are interchangeable under the label of historical armor in their minds it is not much of a jump from a span of 500 to 800 years of equipment being considered interchangeable to 1500 years of equipment and language being interchangeable the title text likely refers to 239 blagofaire which features the said blogger reenactment festivals
