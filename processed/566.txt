n in the first frame it is stated that the comic was released on the anniversary of the movie the matrix this is not true the matrix was released 31 march 1999 in the us although it was next released in australia on 8 april 1999 ten years before the release of this comic but maybe randall drew the comic and had watched the movie on the true 10 year anniversary day  megan is shocked when she realizes it is already ten years ago that the matrix came out this is an effect randall has used to make you feel old several times for instance he mentions the matrix again two years later in 891 movie ages in the matrix almost all of humanity lives in a computer simulation many years ago robots took over the real world not the simulation and placed humans into the simulation while their body heat generated power for the robots a few people have escaped from the matrix and they are on a mission with others to free the human race from the robots the title of the strip is a reference to the documentary on the filming of the matrix the matrix revisited in the first three rows of the comic we see three famous scenes from the matrix parodied by randall the characters are morpheus with sunglasses; neo as cueball in the first two scenes and with a black cape in the third scene; trinity as hairbun; and a security guard in the third scene as another cueball like guy in the first scene morpheus tells neo that one cannot explain what the matrix is and that he must see it for himself to understand morpheus is very mysterious as he tempts neo to take a look himself which in the movie leads to the next scene in this comic however trinity makes morpheus look foolish by clearly explaining the matrix in a single simple phrase and then telling him that he must suck at explaining in the next scene morpheus tries to ignore trinity's remark and continues by showing neo two pills one red and one blue and tells neo that he can either take the blue pill and return to the simulation the matrix never to hear about the matrix again or he can take the red pill and leave the matrix and see how deep the rabbit hole goes a reference to alice in wonderland in the movie neo takes the red pill in the comic however he mixes the two pills then snorts the purple powder he has created as though it was an illegal drug such as cocaine and apparently winds up in a bizarre upside down and inverted dimension presumably caused by his 'drug trip' even morpheus now has no idea where they are note that the inversion of both color and orientation could be intended to evoke the idea of capturing an image on film ie a film negative which is *really* the only place where neo and morpheus exist it is possible that the combination of pills allowed neo to break through another layer of the simulation alternatively this could simply be randall trying to explain that they are in an alternate dimension whilst still remaining within the constraints of stick figures on white and black backgrounds what leads up to the third scene is when neo and trinity must save morpheus who has been captured by agents of the simulation they obtain many guns and load them into trenchcoats in the shown scene neo is stopped at a security checkpoint in a building in the matrix a security guard tells him to remove any metallic items since the scanner has shown him to have metal on his person such as keys and place them in a bin then walk through the scanner again in the movie he opens his trenchcoat revealing a myriad of weapons and dispatching all of the guards with the assistance of trinity in the comic however neo opens his trenchcoat but the guard's response of eww implies that neo is otherwise naked and the guard is disgusted by his display of his genitals this could seem ironic since the guard could be said to be even more naked than him but in the xkcd version of the matrix stick people are presumably fully dressed unless otherwise indicated when randall as cueball has seen the movie he turns to his friends megan and another cueball like guy and exclaims that he had forgotten how great the movie is when his friend suggests that they put on the other two sequels there is a beat panel where megan and cueball look at each other then they beat up the offender off panel  the two sequels to the matrix are widely regarded as inferior to the original with some fans pretending they don't exist this is what happens when megan and cueball return and cueball repeats his statement about how good it was then megan is saddened by the fact they never made any sequels and cueball agrees thus trying hard even violently to forget those sequels on imdb the original movie was still in the top 20 on their top 250 chart in july 2015 with an average of 87 vs only 72 and 67 to the sequels though even those two scores are relatively high compared to other action titles
