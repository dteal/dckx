n a group of people wanting to hold a book burning find themselves in a conundrum as they only have one book going to an online retailer reveals that the kindle edition of the book is considerably less expensive than the hardcover edition unfortunately for the book burners the burning of a kindle proves fatal because of the toxic fumes from the burning of its plastic shell internal electronics and/or the lithium polymer battery that powers it one purpose of book burning is to destroy heretical material and thus prevent the spread of those ideas in this case where a kindle version downloaded and the device is burned no heretical material is destroyed as the electronic version is still available for distribution those who survived the incident will then find that their actions did not prevent the spread of the heretical ideas they have lost dear friends and have to purchase new electronic devices another purpose for a book burning is to have a public demonstration in protest of the ideas presented in the book this may have been the purpose of the book burning mentioned in the comic but this plan failed as indicated by the title text because it was reported in the newspaper which no one reads in the past there were many book burning incidents most of which were based on violent actions against minorities there is also a subtle pun in that kindle means to start a fire the title text further drives home the point that electronic media is becoming the norm while print is being supplanted by inventions like the kindle
