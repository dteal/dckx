n cueball is writing a piece of code probably in the programming language c++ which removes an item from a data structure called a linked list the first two lines of the text then he writes a comment which is delimited by the double slashes relating the code to his personal life finally he adds an assertion which is normally a formal specification of a condition which should always be true with which the programmer ensures that eg mass is not negative but in this case instead of asserting a software related predicate he asserts that it's going to be okay and because of how string literals are treated by the interpreter the assertion will be true an assert is a programming statement that allows you to insert sanity checks into your code for example if you were writing a program to calculate the speed of a neutrino then at the end of the calculation you could say    assert  velocity_of_neutrino &lt;= speed_of_light ;  if the assertion fails then the program will stop with an error this would be much better than publishing an embarrassing paper for example  the title text explains that assertion in question fails we cannot be sure that things are going to be ok
