n cueball is standing in the middle of the first square panel but then the panels frame starts warping away from being square and starts to from into tendrils that moves towards him then slowly wraps themselves around him and finally retracts reforming the frame again but pulling him apart in the process in a very macabre comic even by xkcd standards there is some indication that cueball is also just part of a drawing since his upper torso with parts of each arm is left hanging in the air without any tendrils touching it if it was not stuck in the center of the image it would fall down but more importantly even if all tendrils pulled very fast at the same time it is highly unlikely that they could pull so precise that the body would split in four pieces around this renaming body cross and one of the tendrils should have pulled this part along with either an arm the head or the lower torso this could be some comfort for those that think this is too much of course it could also just be something that randall did not think was important in such a surreal comic  comics often use artifacts on the frame to add mood to the comic this comic then makes those artifacts a major feature of the comic like a chekhov's gun if you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off the title text  could indicate that randall wasn't being very serious about this comic but perhaps it was an idea to creatively use parts of the comic nobody thought about and is spoke for itself and needed no extra comment the three dots also indicate that something more will happen soon the reader may visualize the final result and empty square panel ready for the next unfortunate person to walk into this trap alternatively it could mean that randall found the comic so bizarre even he couldn't comment on it see trivia section
