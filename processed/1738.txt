n the earth's moon being the most prominent object in the night sky is a frequent subject of art; particularly art depicting a nighttime scene unfortunately the moon often appears in works of art in ways that are very dramatic and would not be realistically possible it may be done out of ignorance or knowingly by taking artistic license as someone interested in and who has worked in astronomy this likely bothers randall the moon is well known to have phases describing what portion of the visible surface of the moon is illuminated by sunlight and highly visible and what portion is dark and generally only slightly visible when the moon appears while the sun is also up these phases progress between new when the surface facing the earth is completely dark and full when the surface facing the earth is completely illuminated appearing as a full disk as viewed from earth mid way between those extreme phases is a quarter moon when exactly one half of the surface facing earth is completely dark the light half being one quarter of the total moon's surface because the moon is approximately spherical its illuminated side appears as crescent in shape as it progresses from new to first quarter phase as it progresses from first quarter to full phase observers on earth see a waxing gibbous moon which just means that the dark portion has formed a crescent one can imagine this like a globe on which you draw a straight line from the north pole to the south pole down the center of the side facing you appearing to create two semi circles; upon rotating the globe the line would become rounded as it moved away creating a crescent on the side the line was moved towards because of the geometry involved a line connecting the two points horns of a crescent moon or of the darkened crescent inverse of a gibbous moon must be a diameter of the moon ie it must pass through the center of the circle the deliberate misidentification of a waxing gibbous moon waxing means going from new to full; that is increasing in illuminated area as a wax gibbon a southeast asian ape made of a nonpolar solid is a source of humor in this comic this is probably a reference to hp lovecraft who had several of his stories take place under a gibbous moon for dramatic effect or even more likely a reference to the discworld by terry pratchett often referenced in xkcd as in 1498 terry pratchett in the witch series the gibbous moon is mentioned several time as the most magic rather than the more often used crescent or full moon further because the light portion of the moon is illuminated by sunlight whether or not the moon is in the sky at the same time as the sun the light side of the moon will always be facing towards the sun if the moon is in the night sky the sun must be somewhere below the horizon on the other side of the earth thus at night the light portion of the moon must always be on the half of the moon that faces the horizon there are points during the daytime when the orientation can go the other way it is worth noting that while the moon's dark portion blends imperceptibly with the dark night sky it is still very much a solid body it would therefore would be impossible to see more distant objects such as stars through the dark portion of the moon's circumference this is most dramatically exemplified by a solar eclipse during which the moon passes in front of the sun and is therefore completely dark the sun is lighting only the far side but the moon's circumference still blocks a circular portion of the sun's light  therefore if we were to see any lights in the part of the sky the dark side of the moon blocks they would need to be from sources between us and the moon's surface such as a nuclear war on the moon this comic lists some of the some common mistakes in some cases a depiction may be unrealistic in multiple ways for example the flag of tunisia has both unrealistic horns and a star visible between the horns while the charles vi tarot shows a moon with over long horns pointing towards the horizon in the title text randall is referring to the movie independence day and how one of the alien's ships in the movie 'eclipses' part of the moon he says that if the points go halfway or longer around the moon then he imagines it's caused by an alien ship and interprets the entire piece of art in that context ie aliens are about to attack those shepherds
