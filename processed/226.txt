n in the opening panel of this comic blondie possibly as miss lenhart sees cueball sitting on a swing set she tells him that during his swing he becomes weightless cueball then imagines that at the peak of his swing he is able to become permanently weightless floating above the ground without any support when on a swing or other pendulum ride there is a moment between swinging forwards/backwards and swinging back down again when the forces of gravity friction air resistance etc bring the velocity of the swing to zero at this moment there is no acceleration toward the pivot of the swing since the centripetal acceleration is proportional to the square of the speed so the swinger experiences no centrifugal force of course gravity still acts on the person but if the swing is horizontal at that point then the there is no reaction force so for one moment the swinger is in free fall and experiences weightlessness in the title text cueball asks for a pocket fan believing he could fly around the garden using this small device perhaps as a propeller
