n the comic shows a valentines card that starts off nicely but then escalates quickly becoming very unromantic although probably very honest that the only purpose of this card is getting the receiver into bed it says that if this is not the case if she or he doesn't want to go naked after receiving this card then it is not really meant ie their heart is not in it  the title text implies that this is being offered as a valentine that someone might give and then pretend that they were kidding which seems to imply that they would not in fact be kidding that this represents their real feelings  a funny thing is also that the text on the card implies that if the card indeed does get the receiver naked that the action of giving it was truly meant in that case the giver would always deny that it was not meant and claim he/she is truly in love of course this cannot be true since getting laid was the main motivation of appreciating the 'loved' one in it could be an intentional sexual innuendo
