n the right hand rule is a mathematics and physics trick to learning how to find the cross product of two cartesian vectors in three dimensions first position your right arm in the direction of the first vector in the example diagram in the comic this is to the left then curl your fingers in the direction of the second vector out of the page/screen in the example now point your thumb perpendicular to the other fingers and it will point in the direction of the cross product of those two vectors upwards in the example note that reversing the order of the two vectors also reverses the direction of the cross product the joke relies on non standard ways of measuring which are unusual and much more impractical to emphasize this the third method only works for males provided that he is not impotent while looking at porn it's a penis joke the title text refers to edwin abbott abbott author of the book flatland a story about a two dimensional world
