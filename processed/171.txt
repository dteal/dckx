n the string theory is a theory in theoretical physics for explaining how the universe works it is a theory trying to explain everything belonging to our universe; specifically it aims to unite general relativity and quantum field theories when a new theory is thought up the theorists will usually supply some predictions measurable by experimental physicists string theory's predictions however are few and extremely difficult to test; though its inception was over forty years ago string theory has yet to be experimentally tested randall is unimpressed with string theorists see the punchline to 397 unscientific string theory has not provided any useful new knowledge to engineering science as quantum physics has and lacks the imagination stirring philosophical implications that the general population associates with other fields xe2x80x94 for example quantum scientists have proven predictions like tunneling used by modern electronic devices and relativity is relevant to modern systems like gps navigation string theory hasn't reached that stage yet at the title text randall points out that string theory is so technically difficult that at essentially every level except presumably the very top this explanation is as good as it gets
