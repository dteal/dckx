n the comic is a parody of transformers a fictional group of robots that can transform into vehicles transformers typically are able to transform instantaneously often mid stride by manipulating and rearranging their mechanical parts in this comic however randall has the transformers transform in the same manner that caterpillars transform via metamorphosis into butterflies or moths the first two panels show action scenes that would be appropriate for a transformers comic however the third panel shows the transformers climbing a tree and in the final scene they wrap silk around themselves apparently forming a cocoon or chrysalis the title text furthers this parallel describing a newly transformed helicopter xe2x80x94 presumably the post metamorphosis state of one of the transformers in the panels xe2x80x94 in a manner that would be more appropriate for a freshly emerged butterfly or moth this xkcd comic is one of the few ones not showing just simple stick figures
