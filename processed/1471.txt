n the microbiome is the collection of bacteria that reside in the human digestive tract the bacteria perform several vital digestive and immune support functions different compositions of bacteria collectively referred to as gut flora can be linked to risk of some diseases while other compositions are linked to a decreased risk of some diseases and are therefore called good bacteria the title gut fauna is a play on words fauna means animal life in latin and flora means vegetable life however in this context flora means bacterial life because when microscopes were invented microbial life was considered to be non animal and therefore classified as flora for a good description of the microbiome see the invisible universe of the human microbiome in this comic cueball is visiting a doctor ponytail for some unknown problem the doctor informs him that his gut macrobiome is out of balance which cueball responds to with confusion over whether or not she meant the microbiome or macrobiome a macrobiome instead of being composed of small organisms such as bacteria would be composed of larger organisms such as mammals the phrase gut fauna would refer to any animals living inside a gut as the word fauna refers to animals living in an ecosystem cueball is right to be worried by the doctor's reference to his macrobiome as normal humans shouldn't have large animals living inside them&#91;citation needed&#93; with the exception of some parasites such as helminths or cestoda or in some cases the consumption of live animals such as octopus shrimp and eels no animals belong natively in the human digestive system; all known cases of animals living permanently in the human digestive system are causes of disease his fear is compounded when the doctor prescribes one wolf for cueball to swallow which is normally impossible for average humans and would at the very least result in major interior or exterior damage to cueball and possibly ponytail when the wolf resists being swallowed needless to say this is not common physician practice due to the likely death rate the choice of a wolf echoes the reintroduction of the animals into the macrobiome of yellowstone national park in the united states where they have improved the balance by in part preying on elk and reducing the damage caused by their grazing the dialog between the characters ends with the doctor asking the patient whether he needs a glass of water a typical question asked by health professionals water can help patients swallow oral medication this last phrase further extends the humorous nature of the proposition to swallow the wolf by displaying a confidence of the doctor in her choice of the treatment modality in reality of course drinking a glass of water while attempting to swallow a wolf would make the latter procedure neither easier nor more feasible the title text suggests that swallowing the wolf is not the worst situation that could have occurred as the doctor refers to another way that the wolf could be administered one typical way that microbiomes are restored is through fecal bacteriotherapy most easily described as a poop transfer it could also mean transferred via suppository in either case the worse other way that the doctor is referring to is thus likely the rectal route which for randall is less preferable than attempting to swallow a live wolf however either way would prove either physically impossible and/or lethal if we are to take the doctor at her word that there is indeed some sort of macrobiome inside cueball's gut then perhaps she has some kind of matter compression ability that would make introducing a live wolf a legitimate therapeutic option randall has referenced wolf reintroduction programs before in comic 819 five minute comics part 1
