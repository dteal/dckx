n anthropomorphism or personification is attribution of distinctly human characteristics to animals or non living things we make parallels between ourselves and objects to the point where some people even jocularly worry about hurting the feelings of say an automobile we call ships she we see human faces in objects like the arrangement of lights on the front of a car the spirit mars rover like many high functioning robots in real life and fiction shares many physical similarities with a human being or animal it has a head eyes neck body legs feet arms and a hand and it strikingly resembles robots from fiction such as johnny 5 from short circuit or wall e from the film with the same name thus this comic explores what the spirit rover's life would be like if it had a human personality the rover was never intended to return to earth and lasted 5xc2xbc active years on the martian surface far exceeding its expected mission duration of 90 martian days a sentient  robot might assume that after her initially planned 90 martian day mission was over she'd get to return home so though this heartbreakingly did not happen spirit possibly in a pun on her name keeps her hopes alive as she continues analyzing rock after rock for years  it would be cruelty of the absolute worst kind to create an intelligence with such feelings and then abandon it on an uninhabited planet with no intention of ever bringing it home so one is rather heartened that the spirit rover is in fact just a programmed machine and we explained to it very carefully that it was embarking on a one way trip it is worth pointing out that opportunity the rover's twin has been even more wildly successful and remains operational more than five years after this comic when opportunity had passed a marathon distance randall celebrated this rover with the comic 1504 opportunity the title text has an apparent miscount january 26 2010 is more like sol martian day 2156 by jpl's mission status site not 2274 final contact was on sol 2210 march 22 2010
