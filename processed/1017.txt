n here's the spreadsheet which randall used to calculate the times and dates for the comic it also has a lot of other percentages and dates so take a look if you are interested cueball/randall creates this formula which helps him wait for long stretches of time which goes increasingly faster into the past as more time goes by which gives him the effect of looking like the time goes by quickly  which assists in the waiting process as far as the actual math is concerned the formula is an exponential function ie the variable appears in the exponent the effect that the function grows faster and faster as p grows is due to tp being exponential more precisely when you repeatedly add some constant to the exponent you will repeatedly multiply some other constant with the value of the function compare how slow a value grows by adding even high values 1 1001 2001 3001 4001 5001xe2x80xa6 and how fast it grows by multiplying even low values 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000xe2x80xa6 now the function has to be adjusted so that as randall put it the time spent in each part of the past is loosely proportional to how well i know it the most important adjustment is putting p to the power of three that lowers the amount added to the exponent for low values 01xc2xb3=0001 02xc2xb3=0008 ie only 7/1000 have been added for 10% workflow and increases the amount for high values 08xc2xb3=0512 09xc2xb3=0729 ie more than 1/5 has been added for 10% workflow that means the recent past will pass even slower and the historic past even faster than it already does by choosing an exponential function the remaining adjustments are technical the coefficient in front of pxc2xb3 adjusts the constant by which the result will be multiplied while adding some constant to p while it also roughly ensures that p=1 yields the lifetime of the universe the 3 added to the product in the exponent further adjusts the actual values of the power without touching the slope the multiplicative constant in the parentheses exc2xb3 is subtracted to put the time to 0 when p=0 otherwise the function would start approx 20 yrs and 1 month ago for bigger p this offset does not matter much imagine subtracting 20 yrs from the lifetime of the universe finally the result is subtracted from the current date for aesthetical reasons the formula could tell you 20 yrs ago or it could read february 1992 randall decided the latter would be better also the workout website fitocracy has been mentioned previously in xkcd note that as of the time that this page was last cached the comic was uploaded at 10157790564005% progress
