n an undocumented feature is a part of a software product that is not explained in the documentation for the product cueball has found such a feature a chat room intended to ask for help accessible through the help page of some unnamed old windows utility the people who found the chat room started out using it for its intended purpose helping users of the utility by contacting other users however as time has passed they have become friends and enter the chat only to talk to each other with no relation to computer problems a virtual machine or vm is a computer program designed to emulate the hardware of a full computer in this case users of the old chat room create vms only to have the old operating system installed which included the utility program they use this setup only to access the old chat room this is shown in the third panel where cueball is using a modern laptop to enter the chatroom presumably by means of a vm whereas ponytail is most likely using an old computer as evidenced by the crt monitor a chat room like this must be hosted on some outside server so the narrator of the comic wonders who runs this server an obvious thought about this is if and when the server will be shut down effectively cutting all communication among chat users another obvious thought is why the utility author is still maintaining the chat server since its original purpose of allowing communication between users with problems with the utility program is no longer an issue as everybody has migrated to more modern systems the comic suggests that the reason for doing this can be a bored sysadmin who is just reading the messages of the chat users and following their lives but never writing anything this would turn the chat room into a soap opera for the sysadmin the deep web is a term used to refer to any information which is available online but is hard to find usually because there are no links to that information in web pages the chat room described would be an example of this from this point on the comic takes an existentialist turn a frequent xkcd trait talking about how life is short everything has to end etc the last panel is a reference to facebook's recent announcement that it would start autoplaying video ads and the title text refers to youtube requiring its users to use their real life identities instead of just nicknames these last parts of the comics somehow reveal that the point of the whole comic is just to complain about aggressive money driven policies used by modern social networks in general and facebook in particular it is hinted that randall would prefer older technologies where limited resources would forbid autoplaying videos or huge databases with every detail of every user's life it's possible that the comic is about an actual chat room but more likely it is a complete invention since if it were real someone would have been able to trace its origin however if it is real the participants would not want to confirm this in order to protect their privacy the title text mentions the simplicity of this chat; even user names do not exist and other users could only be identified by their behavior because the user names are random and can change on every login
