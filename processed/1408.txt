n several of the xkcd comics outline ways to make people feel older by referencing various pieces of popular culture which feel ingrained and recent and revealing the time that has elapsed since their release to be longer than expected for instance 1393 timeghost and 891 movie ages this appears to be what black hat is doing as he walks in on megan to announce that all the penguins from a 2005 documentary march of the penguins about emperor penguins are dead megan is familiar with these sorts of antics and assumes black hat is indicating that the film is so old that the lifespan of emperor penguins is less than the time since the documentary was released frustrated megan simply acknowledges black hat's statement by agreeing that everyone is aging black hat however reveals that he is not trying to make her feel old because the penguins were all alive last night and died of a cause other than time's passage his announcement that he is trying to apologize creates the obvious inference that he killed the penguins this gives the situation a much darker tone; especially since black hat likely is not truly apologizing as he is very unapologetic in his classhole tendencies emperor penguins actually live about 20 years on average so presumably barring any intervention by black hat most of the younger penguins and many of the older penguins in the movie are still alive as of this comic the title text emphasizes that whatever the penguins' fate we do get and are getting older the text may also be a further jab by black hat as he departs just to make megan feel a bit worse
