n this comic refers to the classic british sketch comedy group monty python been active primarily during the 1970s and early 1980s but also partly reunified in 2014 whose humor style was frequently based on surreal jokes that subverted sense and logic their sketches are so popular that as noted in the comic many fans can repeat the dialog word for word and often do this comic points out the inherent irony of repeating a surrealist sketch as surrealist humor primarily depends on presenting something the audience does not expect by repeating the sketch verbatim among those who have already seen it the listeners know and expect the punchlines and jokes this is akin to a common ironic concept of a teenager who wants to rebel against conformity by doing all the things his friends are also doing the monty python sketch in question here is the knights who say ni sketch about a group of knights who protect certain sacred words including the word ni pronounced like knee but shortened and with more staccato the image text refers to the film monty python and the holy grail in which the knights sketch appeared the comic suggests that readers continue in the surreal traditions of monty python and provides an example the character in panels 3 6 interrupts his retelling of the sketch with what appears to be a traumatic recalling of the time he saw someone run a woman over with his car and kill her before returning to the sketch the surreal humor is that the character dismisses the significant and serious comment he has just made by returning to the sketch as if nothing happened the title text refers to how fans of monty python can go for long periods of time simply quoting the sketches as one person quotes a sketch another recognizes it and says another quote without context assuming everyone will recognize it perhaps a more contemporary version of this might be the simpsons or family guy quote frenzies
