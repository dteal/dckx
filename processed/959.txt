n here are the lyrics for the first verse of the christmas carol good king wenceslas  good king wenceslas looked out on the feast of stephen when the snow lay round about deep and crisp and even; brightly shone the moon that night tho' the frost was cruel when a poor man came in sight gath'ring winter fuel  while not a king wenceslaus i duke of bohemia is considered a martyr and a saint far from being responsible for any massacre he protected his subjects from external dominance and is still a national hero to the czech people black hat is supplying disinformation to unsuspecting carolers either to shut them up or just because he's a classhole like that the title text references the feast of stephen which is also known as the feast of st stephen or st stephen's day which is a holiday celebrated on 26 or 27 december depending on the western or eastern church respectively it is not actually a feast that involved eating a person named stephen instead a celebration of the saint named stephen if you look closely you can see that the carolers may be a family the man and woman are confused by what black hat has said and the girl is looking to the adults perhaps gauging their facial reactions or just waiting for their reply
