n megan has won an award at a ceremony presumably movie related and possibly an academy award as she mentions her director when a person receives a major award they give an acceptance speech which traditionally begins with the recipient thanking people who have helped them achieve the honour sometimes when a number of people are mentioned the recipient will say that it was a team effort a comment which elevates the helpers to virtually the same level as the recipient megan's acceptance speech takes things a step further; she thanks not only her director family and friends but also the bacteria that populate her gastrointestinal tract as she states correctly the number of bacterial cells inside a human body outnumber the number of human cells by as much as a factor of 10 while the bacteria in the gut make digestion possible the ecosystem formed by bacteria in the urogenital tract and on the skin also protect human health in short without them megan would die xe2x80x94 and not be able to win the award to thank her bacteria is comparable to thanking her parents they did not really contribute to the movie but without them there would not have been a megan and no award recently it has been shown that the gut bacteria has an effect on emotions thoughts and mood link in the title text megan contemplates how to thank her microorganisms and considers to eat the trophy after having it cut in pieces this is an extremely bad idea because it might kill both her and the microorganisms a pint is a volume of about half a liter specifically the us fluid version is 28 and 7/8 cuin
