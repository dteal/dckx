n megan is paraphrasing a famous quote from the british applied mathematician and fellow of the royal society horace lamb who famously stated in 1932  i am an old man now and when i die and go to heaven there are two matters on which i hope for enlightenment one is quantum electrodynamics and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids and about the former i am rather optimistic  this was referring to two phenomena in physics that at the time were poorly understood and difficult to explain lamb proved to be correct in his prediction that quantum electrodynamics qed was easier to explain; nowadays we have a much clearer understanding of qed while our understanding of turbulence has improved little richard feynman who was himself largely responsible for explaining qed famously described turbulence as the most important unsolved problem of classical physics cueball in response indicates that if he were to gain divine elucidation his question would relate to the widespread schoolyard rhyme miss susie which typically begins with the stanza  miss susie had a steamboat the steamboat had a bell miss susie went to heaven the steamboat went to  hell o operator please give me number nine   the rhyming scheme between the second and fourth lines and implied contrast with heaven causes the listener to fill in the word hell instead of the innocuous hello therefore cueball is wondering what a steamboat an object lacking will could have done to deserve divine punishment the title text is a reference to the 1930s pulp series the shadow whose eponymous character is a psychic vigilante the 1937 radio plays introduction began with the line who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men the shadow knows unfortunately since a steamboat is not a person to begin with let alone a man specifically the shadow would be unable to determine what heinous crimes the steamboat had committed to deserve damnation this comic in particular the way megan and cueball are walking and its reference to theology greatly resembles the later comic 1505 ontological argument
