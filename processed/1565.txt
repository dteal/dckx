n this comic makes fun of the common situation of a messy car using a hyperbolic scenario of that car containing decaying animals in this case a raccoon the joke being that such a car is so disgusting that a dead raccoon is not the worst thing that one might encounter the humor comes from the car owner seeming to be used to a dead raccoon and the implications of what might be worse than a dead raccoon this is the polar opposite of 1267 mess where the person apologizes for a nearly non existent mess here the person minimizes a completely atrocious mess into a quick fix situation the form of the comic is that of a pro tip which tells the reader what the phrase i just have to clear a few things out of the back really means 'protips' are used to give snarky obvious or inadequate advice in order to either humor a well learnt audience or to prank a naxc3xafve audience this phenomenon originated in a gaming magazine column offering advice on doom to defeat the cyberdemon shoot at it until it dies randall has given us several protips in the past as well the title text further exposes the reality of the person's knowledge of how bad the situation really is when he acknowledges the existence of the dead raccoon while trying to usher the live one to the same side protip sitting next to a dead and a live raccoon is not an improved scenario
