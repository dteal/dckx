n this comic is a list of questions which randall has about the solar system which at first glance may appear to be things that randall would like to learn about in actuality most of the questions have not been satisfactorily answered or proven by anyone in the scientific community      question given   answer given by randall in red in the original   comments    why is the the moon so blotchy   lava   the moon is in synchronous rotation with earth which means that we always can see only one half of the surface of the moon and on that side we can see large lunar maria formed by lava from big volcanoes this surface is very different from all other celestial bodies we know in our solar system the double the the could be a randallism xe2x80x94 intended or unintended    why are all the blotches on the near side      the nearside of the moon is dominated by the blotchy 'seas' or maria the far side by craters several explanations for this have been proposed including an overabundance of impacts obliterating the blotches on the more exposed far side different compositions of heat producing elements large collisions or heat produced by the still cooling earth    did mars have seas   yes briefly   recent explorations have confirmed there was once standing and also flowing water on mars  many rovers and orbiters on mars give us the evidence on this early development of that planet but it is still unknown how long such conditions existed in its history two of these probes have been the subject of comics before 695 spirit and 1504 opportunity    was there life on mars      one of the big mysteries not yet answered    what's titan like   cold yellow lakes + rivers methane   the cassinixe2x80x93huygens mission confirmed the presence of lakes and rivers on titan the huygens lander itself returned some very yellow images of a dry lake bed from titan's surface the possibility of life on titan was mentioned in 829 arsenic based life    what was earth like during the hadean      the hadean was the first geologic era on earth the planet had just formed and not much is known of that period of earth but since it was the time when earth was formed it was mainly very hot with extreme volcanic activity with the entire surface melted this is why the era is named after hades the ancient greek god of the underworld even though hades was never associated with fire    is the oort cloud a real thing      the oort cloud is a theoretical spherical cloud of icy planetesimals maybe dust and also larger objects at a distance of up to around 100000 au from our sun we can see similar clouds at other stars but there is still no evidence that this cloud exists in our solar system    why is the sun's corona so hot   something about magnets   the corona of the sun is hotter than it theoretically should be tiny solar flares called nanoflares are responsible    what are comets like   precipitous   the philae lander finally stopped moving when it ran into a cliff    where's philae exactly      but we were not sure which cliff until september 5 2016 when the european space agency announced that philae had been found and photographed by rosetta on the previous friday september 2 the landing of philae was depicted in real time in the dynamic comic 1446 landing this lasted for several hours later the comic was updated with a new image where philae is resting on the edge of a cliff    what's pluto like   soon   pluto is so far from earth and so small that traditional telescopes couldn't discern much about it when this comic was released the probe new horizons was eight days away from its closest approach to pluto and its moon charon; randall was naturally excited about it the probe was the subject of the comic 1532 new horizons    what's charon like    why don't we have in between sized planets      there is a size gap between the rocky terrestrial planets up to earth size and the gas giants very much larger than earth in our solar system there are many known exoplanets planets in other solar systems filling in the range between our rocky planets and our gas giants known as super earths     what's ceres like   working on it   the dawn probe is currently exploring the dwarf planet ceres and reveals unseen surface features    why is europa so weird looking and pretty   ice over a water ocean   europa is a moon of jupiter and the surface is basically thick pack ice covered in lineae    why is io so weird looking   sulfur volcanoes  in the wrong places   the moon io is also orbiting jupiter and is close enough that tidal forces make it the most volcanic object in the solar system the moon is mainly yellow but there are several other colors on the surface for instance spots and streaks of bright red that comes from sulfur ejected by the volcanoes the wrong places refer to some volcanoes discovered by the voyager missions and believed to erupt sulfur but more recent measurements showed that the temperature inside those volcanoes is about 2000&#160;xc2xb0c where this element is not liquid anymore but gas    why are so many kuiper belt objects red      many objects in the kuiper belt have a reddish hue a possible explanation is that they are covered in organic molecules formed by the irradiation of their surface ices the new horizons probe might also shed light on this    what are those spots on ceres      the dawn probe found some mysterious spots on ceres these white spots are still not understood but the mission is still running and we may figure out the source of the glowing white features these spots became the punch line of the joke in 1476 ceres    what's in the seas under europa's ice      the esa selected the mission jupiter icy moon explorer juice to jupiter the moon europa is one target for that mission but we have to wait because its launch target is 2022 and the arrival at jupiter is planned for 2030 but that's not uncommon for missions like this new horizons and rosetta also traveled approximately ten years to reach their targets and before such a mission can start many preparations have to be done 2010 odyssey two is a 1982 science fiction novel by arthur c clarke in which he envisions life under the ice on europa this life becomes a major plot point both in this and in the two sequels    which of the other moons have seas   several   randall has already mentioned above that there are liquids on two moons the moon titan at saturn has lakes on its surface formed by liquid ethane methane and propane and the jupiter's moon europa has a sea of water covered by a thick sheet of ice depending on the definition of 'sea' other less obviously 'frozen water world' moons such as ganymede at jupiter may have subsurface oceans of liquid water and on other moons it could be other substances that are liquid at the relevant temperature like on titan    what are the big white things in titan's lakes      this is a joke about some gaps in the radar measurements as shown in this image    what do jupiter's clouds look like up close      the jupiter mission galileo operated by nasa and the german aerospace center dlr arrived at jupiter in 1995 and was sent to impact the planet at the end of that mission in 2003 to eliminate the possibility of contaminating local moons with terrestrial bacteria several measurements were done on the atmosphere but no pictures were sent back to earth so there is still no answer on this question    what's all that red stuff in the great red spot      the great red spot is a storm south of jupiter's equator observations from earth show a lifespan of more than 150 years it's unknown why it's stable for that long a time and it's also not clear why the color is red the probe juno will arrive in july 2016 at jupiter and maybe answer randall's question    what's pushing the pioneer probes   heat from the rtg   discussed as the pioneer anomaly rtg stands for radioisotope thermoelectric generator this effect was mentioned and explained a little differently in the title text of 502 dark flow    what pushes spacecraft slightly during flybys      several spacecraft experienced unexplained speed increases during earth flybys this is called the flyby anomaly    where are all the sun's neutrinos   oscillating   there are fewer observed electron neutrinos from the sun than the standard model predicts this is called the solar neutrino problem since the sum of all the neutrinos regardless of type that come from the sun add up to the predicted number of electron neutrinos it is theorized that neutrinos can change their type this is called neutrino oscillation and can occur only if neutrinos have mass neutrino oscillation is considered a proof that the mass of a neutrino is non zero the mass of a neutrino is not yet measured and is one of the problems on the list of unsolved problems in physics on wikipedia    why is there so much air on titan      titan has an atmospheric pressure 145 times that of earth but only 1/7th of the surface gravity which is less than earth's own airless moon has hence the confusion in fact titan actually has almost 20% more atmosphere by mass than earth and seven times more atmosphere across a given surface area less influence from the more distant sun probably helps retain more of the atmosphere's gases for instance mars saw most of its atmosphere blasted away by the sun and cryovolcanoes may replenish the methane fraction which should by now have all been converted into the other hydrocarbons present from subsurface reservoirs further studies are required to properly answer this question    why does the kuiper belt stop      a reference to the kuiper cliff most kuiper belt objects are found between 42 and 48 au; calculations predicted that there would be more and larger kbos beyond 50 au but instead very few objects have been found in that region the reason for this is still unknown    why is iapetus weird colored      iapetus is a moon of saturn and always keeps the same face towards saturn the trailing side is white while the other side is dark    why does iapetus have a belt      iapetus has a 13&#160;km high ridge around most of the equator and a number of 10 km high mountains where the ridge is interrupted    what's the deal with miranda      miranda is the smallest of uranus' five round satellites and it's a bit rough around the edges and also has an unusually high orbital inclination that is difficult to explain also possibly a firefly reference since miranda is also the name of a planet in serenity a film based on the firefly tv series    did uranus and neptune change places      the nice model is a theory of how our solar system formed which suggests the possibility of uranus and neptune having swapped places before reaching their current positions work by professor s desch also came to this result    did the late heavy bombardment happen      the late heavy bombardment is the name given to a theorized bombardment of the planet earth during its early history along with the other rocky planets around the sun it's believed that during that time many large objects still existed and are likely to have impacted the planets on earth the evidence for those impacts would have been destroyed but on the moon or mercury some evidence may be available    did life start before it      for some speculation on this topic see life could have survived earth's early bombardment it is still a mystery if life was formed on earth first or if it came from outer space    is europa covered in ice spikes     dr daniel hobley has put forward a theory that jupiter's icy moon europa has the right conditions to form ice spikes called penitentes of up to 10m in height    why haven't we built a big inflatable extreme sports complex on the moon      apart from the question on the white on titan this is the only really silly question that has nothing to do with science or the solar system however it would be fun to watch sports in such a stadium see the title text see also eg the menace from earth a 1957 short story by robert heinlein  the title text refers to the 2015 fifa women's world cup which was won by the usa the day before the nylon wings and flying may be a reference to two passages from 3001 the final odyssey one where frank poole tries out various wings while in an extremely low gravity environment and one where he remarks while watching swan lake that tchaikovsky could never have imagined a performance where the dancers were actually flying due to aforementioned low gravity this is also a reference to the last point on the list because if we had such a stadium on the moon maybe it would be possible to use such wings to make very long floating leaps
