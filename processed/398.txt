n this comic uses verbal irony to exploit the application of double meanings the phrase tap that ass is a colloquialism for to have intercourse with that person and is most likely how the reader expects the phrase to be used however throughout the comic this is not the case in the first panel it is possible that cueball is using tap that ass sexually however it is more likely that he is using tap to mean pick or choose in which case he would be the one choosing the next committee chair that ass refers to one of the individuals in the meeting room to be picked for the position in the second panel tap is referring to wiretapping the cueball character with the headphones on has just unplugged his headphone this suggests he and his colleague at the phone were just done with the wiretapping in this scenario it is strange that the colleague is still on the phone instead of hanging up however it would be much stranger to wiretap someone in plain eyesight unless that person is blind ass likely refers to the person they have just wiretapped cueball says he'd tap that ass without a warrant suggesting that they had one in this situation in the third panel tap is referring to extracting sap from trees a sexual connotation would make no sense in this context that ass refers to the maple tree in the final panel cueball has a chance to now use the phrase tap that ass to mean having intercourse the punchline is that he does not do so and instead explicitly states he'd have sex with a tree the title text features a request from cueball from the last panel to cueball from the third panel he asks cueball not to plug up the hole left behind from tapping the tree so he can have sex with it
