n this is the third of three five minute comics randall posted during a week in november 2010 the introduction to the comic explains everything you need to know about the circumstances behind it  randall obviously made more than three of these five minutes comics and one of them was published later for a short period of time by a mistake but an android xkcd browser picked it up while it was on line and saved it since then it has been added to explain xkcd so here is a complete list of all four comics in the entire five minute comics series  819 five minute comics part 1 820 five minute comics part 2 821 five minute comics part 3 five minute comics part 4  here is a list with explanations for each of the small comics  pearl harbor is a us navy base that was attacked in 1941 by japanese airplanes which prompted the us to join world war ii the attacks were made on december 7 1941 not november 7 thus randall is correct in depicting a navy base going about its usual business  breastfeeding in public is a touchy subject in parts of the world in the us it is considered by some to be inconsiderate to others who would prefer not to see such a display of course women breastfeeding in public are generally feeding their infants not other adults the situation presented in the comic is an absurd exaggeration of the debate  s is the command in sed to perform a pattern search and replace; the syntax has also been adopted by other text processing utilities including perl a favorite subject of xkcd and has entered into the geek lexicon as something that could appear in general conversation the specific command s/i think that/i saw a study once that said/g means find all occurrences of the phrase 'i think that' and replace it with the phrase 'i saw a study once that said' this will indeed improve the persuasiveness of an article as the existence of scientific evidence will make people more likely to believe what's said while most people won't even think to actually look up the study in question  arson is the crime of intentionally setting fire to a structure billy joel will no doubt claim he didn't start the fire  coca cola is a fizzy cola flavored soft drink commonly abbreviated as coke pop rocks are a candy that contain tiny bubbles of gas so that as the sugary candy dissolves on your tongue it creates a popping sensation for a long time it was claimed that drinking the two together would cause one's stomach to explode; this was finally put to rest as some people the mythbusters in particular started actually trying it and discovered that it's merely painful not lethal  here it's combined with elements of other common scary urban legends phones ringing and creepy laughter to form something bizarre  after brown v board of education ruled that schools could not segregate based on race nine african american students from little rock arkansas enrolled in the previously segregated little rock central high school the school board could not officially deny them attendance but members of the community and after arkansas governor orval faubus intervened the arkansas national guard formed a blockade to physically prevent them from entering the school building the governor claimed this was within his power even after brown v board because the students were enrolled without issue they were just physically blocked from entering the school building after determining that the right to enroll in a school does implicitly include the right to actually attend classes there president eisenhower ordered the 101st airborne division to accompany the students and force the national guard to stand down thus integrating the school this incident became known as the little rock nine  however integration also has a meaning in mathematics this is indicated in the comic with the soldiers lifting up a giant integral sign to place beside the school in order to mathematically integrate it normally an integral only makes sense on functions; however since this is the little rock nine if we take the integral of the constant function fx = 9 we do in fact get 9x + c as stated in the title text  cell phones with advanced computing capabilities typically at least requiring fully featured internet browsing multimedia capabilities and the ability to run software applications are called smartphones most cell phones also have a vibrate function that allows someone in a public situation to receive calls without alerting others; the phone will discreetly vibrate rather than activate a ringtone thus privately notifying the owner that a call is incoming a semi common problem with this feature is that a vibrating phone on a table that has a slight slope will slowly or if the slope is bad enough rather quickly slide down the slope possibly falling off the table and breaking if our smartphones ever decided to kill us this would possibly be their only method of attack randall later covered this in his what if blog 1   the three little pigs is a children's fairy tale about three pigs who build their houses out of respectively straw sticks and bricks a wolf comes along and eats the pigs living in the straw and stick houses but he can't knock down the brick house because his only method for breaking them down is to blow on them until the material falls to pieces  the 119 little pigs seems to be a variant where the pigs build their houses out of the 119 chemical elements the 38th little pig builds his house out of strontium which is of course the 38th element on the periodic table one wonders what happened to the pigs who are stuck making their houses out of elements that are gaseous or liquid at room temperature or those whose houses would react with the air and/or undergo nuclear decay although given the water content in exhaled breath it's easy to see how the wolf would huff puff and blow down the houses made of lithium sodium potassium rubidium caesium and francium though making a houses out of hydrogen helium nitrogen oxygen fluorine neon chlorine and krypton would all be very difficult as they are gases at room temperature also there would be issues such as death from the toxicity of the elements eg fluorine would kill the pig and wolf the piggies may have difficulty collecting enough metal as they would have trouble collecting enough technetium 43 which only occurs in minute traces and astatine of which approximately 1 ounce exists on earth   fastest gun in the west is a boast commonly made in western movies where it is used to mean that a person is the fastest at drawing his gun in a duel or alternatively can fire his gun the fastest it doesn't actually describe the gun itself and certainly doesn't describe how fast the gun can gallop across the land  it's what separates the men from the boys is a phrase used to describe macho activities that apparently only real men will participate/do well in; all the other men haven't grown up yet and are thus boys centrifuges are used to rapidly separate a material from the liquid it's suspended in; this is either a pun on the word separate or an attempt by randall to make the occupation of lab technician seem macho in the film moonraker james bond was almost killed in a centrifuge used as a g force training vehicle for pilots/astronauts but he survived and he for sure is a real man see also 123 centrifugal force   narnia is the mythical land in the chronicles of narnia in the books time passes differently in narnia such that one can spend many years in narnia and come out to find that almost no time at all has passed on earth; conversely during a short trip back to earth hundreds of years could pass in narnia lucy is taking advantage of this by putting a computer in narnia to perform extremely fast computation
