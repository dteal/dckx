n this comic deals with the idea that user generated online star ratings are usually heavily biased towards the best possible rating five stars firstly because we instinctively read a rating of five stars as five points but the lowest possible rating is actually one star and not zero as would be the lowest possible score with a five point scale this means that a three star rating which looks like a 3/5 seems a good rating whereas it is actually the median rating like 10/20 which does not seem a very good score secondly because the online ratings are given by users who firstly browse web pages about the rated products; and there is a general tendency that the users who browse online content about a product are more likely users who in the first place were interested by said product and for instance have searched for it so the product ratings are given by a part of the population that on average enjoy the concerned products more than the rest of the population therefore ratings are on average higher than what the full range from one to five stars could express for these reasons randall suggests a way to read these ratings which is to consider the four star rating the median value ok and everything below as a crap rating see also 937 tornadoguard another comic about star ratings no product is so perfect that every user will give it five stars so the only explanation for a five star rating is that only a few users have voted maybe only one the title text may refer to the folkloric practice of attributing a feeling of a chill to someone walking on your future grave when randall is back home he would like to give a bad rating on yelp xe2x80x94 a corporation operates an online urban guide xe2x80x94 and hovering his hand over the 'one star' button he was just 'walking' over the rating on his own future grave another possible explanation for the title text is that the headstones are from people that gave the cemetery low star ratings and were then murdered having their given ratings displayed in the headstones this in turn would explain the chill randall feels before clicking the one star button
