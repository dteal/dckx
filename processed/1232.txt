n many people are opposed to space exploration  while the overall budget of nasa is not very large compared to the big spenders such as health education social services and the military individual space missions seem very expensive to the general public typically hundreds of millions of dollars and the actual benefits derived from them can seem intangible to put it simply many people think that the money can be better spent on earth where there are real serious problems that need to be addressed the decision on how to best allocate our money is not a simple one white hat believes we should not explore space until we have solved all our problems here on earth this is unreasonable it is vague broad and near impossible to achieve at least within the span of a human life the basic problems that face us all war disease hunger climate change natural disasters general malaise have been with us since the dawn of humanity at least and will certainly be around for much longer than ten or fifteen years if not ten or fifteen centuries  cueball however is playing the naive engineer thinking that everything is as easy and simple as the math problems he uses everyday this serves two purposes first it highlights the untenability of white hat's statement by emphasizing their size and second it serves as a punchline as anyone with a modicum of common sense knows nothing is that simple when humans are involved  in the title text randall leans towards fifteen years as ten doesn't seem sufficient given all the problems this also may be said by cueball or white hat replying to cueball
