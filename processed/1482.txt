n there are a variety of applications that post a user's music listening habits on their preferred social network in this comic randall takes that notion to its extreme envisioning a program that does this note by note rather than just song by song as songs play several dozen notes a minute and some songs many more this would lead to the flooding of friends' notification streams in the example the software is sharing the notes that brian is listening to; and his friends mike and caitlin are getting annoyed with the number of posts they are receiving there are typically many hundreds of notes in any song  any song with more than a single line of music contains multiple different notes whose names according to the english convention are communicated here all but the slowest songs will require reporting dozens to hundreds of notes every minute a single glissando may cover a dozen or more notes in less than a second meaning that anyone who can see your stream of posts will be literally inundated by posts from the service even if you could keep up with the speed of the posted notes that someone is listening to the similarity in phrases in many songs especially pop songs eg pachelbel's rant means that many different songs may include the same sequence of notes though possibly in different octaves or at different speeds the comic's title alludes to the fact that you can play a song but can also play a note it may also allude to the visual similarities between the hash/pound/number sign # and the sharp sign xe2x99xaf c sharp above mike's comment is the only note not given by a single letter after the correction see trivia the title text continues the joke of this new musical service if you click on the post it takes you to search results for the note on various online music store since many songs in similar keys contain at least some of the notes posted you would be given a list of a large part of the music you can buy in any on line music stores of course this is at least as useless as being told which note someone is listening to here are some synthesized versions of the notes in the order they appear in the comic  ogg midi  they appear to be the beginning of i'll be there for you by the rembrandts the title music of the tv series friends  this could be an internal reference to the idea that it notifies converts into musical notes your friends of the notes a play on words alternatively it could simply be an instance of effective nerd sniping
