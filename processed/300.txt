n this comic approaches how social networks have changed the ways of human interaction with everyone placing their personal interests on their facebook profile pages it has become fairly easy to gather a lot of information about people in the comic cueball uses this information to his advantage he ascertained megan's musical preferences beforehand in order to create the illusion of their sharing mutual interests megan is led to believe that he is like minded thus making it easier for cueball to persuade her into having sex with him here the comic takes at the fact that many people use facebook as a hunting ground for sexual contacts apparently megan did not only mention her favorite bands in her profile but also her preferred sex position this can be read as a sideswipe at what intimate details some people are willing to share on the internet although mentioning sexual preferences is hyperbolic here megan's taste in both fields can be regarded as outside the mainstream regina spektor and the polyphonic spree are representatives of the indie pop genre the wheelbarrow nsfw features the man standing behind the woman and holding her legs while she props up in a wheelbarrow like position the retrograde variant has the woman facing upwards unusual sex positions are also mentioned in comics 414 mistranslations and 487 numerical sex positions the title text suggests that cueball did not stop at reading megan's interests on her facebook profile but also obtained her phone number and placed it in his phone it is implied that some of the mildly sleazy uses of facebook can border on the verge of stalking when megan discovers the number she may realise this and stay clear of cueball
