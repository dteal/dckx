n this is yet another xkcd comic referencing firefly but it's not so much about firefly itself as about summer glau summer glau is an american actress best known for playing river tam in firefly and serenity as well as cameron in the terminator the sarah connor chronicles series cueball claims that he gives a long and seemingly well researched reply to a stupid comment on a blog just to let out his anger in this particularly long comment at first he becomes what is known over the internet as 'grammar nazi' then he proceeds to rip apart the commenter by citing his/her historical and political ignorance he signs his comment as 'summer glau' after which he reminds the blogger to watch the next season of terminator the sarah connor chronicles series one likely reason that he uses 'summer glau' is that she is worshiped by geeks the world over even those incapable of writing coherent blog posts crackmonkey74 would not risk responding negatively to the post just in case it was actually written by summer glau and by so doing he would ruin any chance he has of sleeping with her in this way cueball is assured of the last word in this argument which makes for a most satisfying vent another possible explanation is that river tam has a genius level intellect and is also mentally disturbed leaving her as some kind of extreme autistic savant given xkcd's trend of comparing firefly characters to their respective actors especially 577 581 cueball is probably using summer glau's name simply because an exhaustively researched blog comment seems like something river tam  and thus possibly summer glau  would do the title text refers to the famous dialogue from firefly episode 11 trash
