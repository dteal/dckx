n a random number generator is any object or program that arbitrarily selects and produces a number from within a pre defined range of numbers for example a single six sided die will produce any integer between 1 and 6 inclusive in an unweighted random number generator every number that it can possibly produce has the same odds of coming up when rolling a single precision die for instance there is an equal chance of rolling a 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 conversely in a weighted random number generator some numbers are more likely to come up than others for example when rolling two dice a seven is far more likely to come up than a two as there are six possible ways to roll a seven but only one way to roll a two  all sports generate numbers that are inherently random home runs goals sacks passes shots hits misses errors and many more such statistics are generated in every match of every sports game the rules of the particular sport as well as the skill of the participants introduces bias toward certain values; hence sports matches are weighted random number generators if the generator is weighted to favor a specific team in a specific game that is discussed then the results of the game more random numbers are discussed it's the discussion that is the narrative part if a player breaks a record that becomes part of the narrative the number is random but weighted because of player skill or the rules of the sport the title text applies this to financial/stock results/forecasts as well and most appropriately to dungeons &amp; dragons d&amp;d which is a game where most aspects of the game are determined by rolling dice of various numbers of sides and the numerical results are woven into a narrative by the dungeon master this strip is one of several in which randall affectionately trivializes sports see for instance 1107 sports cheat sheet 1480 super bowl and 1507 metaball
