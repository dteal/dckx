n this comic is a play on the well known good cop/bad cop police interrogation strategy and the artistic movement dadaism  dadaism is an artistic movement which by its definition is irrational the movement embraces the free flow of unreasoned thought and prizes nonsense and rejection of established norms as such the entire concept of good cop dadaist cop could be considered a dadaist concept in itself good cop/bad cop is a psychological tactic that may be employed during joint questioning or interrogation the interrogators isolate the suspect one of the interrogators acts unreasonable and untrustworthy bad cop and the other reasonable and trustworthy in comparison good cop  if successful it deceives the suspect into believing they must choose to trust one of the interrogators and the suspect chooses to co operate with the good cop or merely complies out of fear of the bad cop  the comic starts with the good cop the male police officer and the dadaist cop ponytail working out their plan to interrogate the suspect hairy after the good cop makes a few statements intended to build trust with hairy and leaves to get coffee ponytail enters the interrogation and starts asking hairy absurd questions hairy quickly becomes agitated and questions what is wrong with ponytail  good cop/bad cop hinges on the suspect's fear and distrust of the intentions of the bad cop; thankfully for the police ponytail's dadaist cop seems to be a successful bad cop too judging by the suspect's fear of her irrational unpredictable and potential crazy behavior not to mention loud and aggressive mannerisms the title text builds on the joke as by asking a suspect to give the whereabouts of the money in a dadaist manner which would be completely useless in finding it  such a statement could be used as a confession though
