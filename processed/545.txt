n wikipedia is an online encyclopedia with content developed and submitted by volunteers around the world in fact its slogan is wikipedia the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit most articles on the site can be altered by anyone with access to wikipedia wikipedia has set some standards for its operation which it refers to as the five pillars of wikipedia one of these pillars is titled wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view pro life and pro choice refer to two opposing viewpoints in the debate of the moral and legal rights concerning abortion for many on both sides it is a very emotional topic black hat has decided to prove that you can create an article which fundamentally cannot remain neutral since his charitable donation is determined by the word count of the article any submission to wikipedia must result in supporting either pro life or pro choice and with a reward of one million dollars it is unlikely that either side would allow an article to remain unedited which supported its opponent the title of the comic references an old read pre internet meme possibly of yiddish origin known as shm reduplication the speaker replaces the initial consonant cluster have it 0 1 or even 2+ consonants with the cluster schm read /xcax83m/ and says the new word after the unadulterated word as in the title where it is n that has been replaced this denotes an active apathy or an intentional disregard of the authority for it is usually an authority or someone in a similar position being mocked in this case black hat is disregarding wikipedia's neutrality doctrine with his word count dependent donation rule the title text is a statement from the wikipedia author in an attempt to assert the neutrality of the submission claiming no word count was performed before posting an unlikely scenario
