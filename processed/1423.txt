n cueball and megan are on a first date and cueball is trying to strike up a conversation by asking megan what she does in her free time megan has probably been dreading this question because she answers that her free time activity consists of trying to figure out how to respond if asked what she does in her free time cueball answers soothingly but megan's anxiety gets the better of her and she leaves abruptly during megan speaking cueball finished all of his drink he may have been surprised by the reply and megan sensing this contributes to her leaving the title text implies that she also spends her free time wondering what to write in her diary with no success both the comic and the title text are examples of self referential humor megan recognises that she spends her free time thinking what to say about her free time so she must spend some of that free time thinking about her thinking about her free time such self referential loops are often disturbing since they contain within them potential for infinite regression on the other hand there is a simple way to exit the loop before any recursion megan has already decided what to say when asked what she does in her free time and she has figured out what to write in her diary but on realising this megan would have to find something else to occupy her free time such as going on a date
