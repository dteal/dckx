n this is a followup to 1363 xkcd phone which debuted the original xkcd phone this thus became the second entry in the ongoing xkcd phone series it is the first of two comics with smartphones as the subject in a row this comic was followed by 1466 phone checking where megan holds a smart phone which she incidentally also does the comic after that 1467 email like the other xkcd phones this comic parodies modern smartphone advertising with a promotional image for a fictional phone like the previous xkcd phone the advertisement features a useless tagline very few people can use two phones at the same time and touts a variety of features which are either pointless misleading or physically impossible clockwise from the top left they are  maxhd over 350 pixels per screen 350&#160;pixels is not very impressive as each would be about 05xc3x9705&#160;cm in size making the resolution hopelessly blocky even if it implies 350&#160;pixels along the edge this is still less than standard definition tv pal gives 576&#160;lines of horizontal resolution likely a reference to hd+ fullhd quadhd and other marketing expressions for screen resolutions by which common users are often confused in 732 hdtv randall has observed that hd is not an especially high resolution when compared with smartphone or computer monitors this one is even worse by far but maxhd sounds similar to fullhd so it could fool some users into thinking that this is equal or better   note a high pixel density display is more than 200&#160;pixels per inch not per screen an example would be the retina display in apple hardware which varies from 218&#160;pixels per inch to 401&#160;pixels per inch depending on the device  always on speaker an always on microphone is a genuine feature allowing voice activated intelligent personal assistant software such as google's google now apple's siri or microsoft's cortana to respond without having to be turned on an always on speaker would be less useful especially if it implies the phone is always making noise blood pressure reliever this appears to be where a real phone would have its front facing camera this could imply that it's a sharp part that you can cut yourself on thus relieving your blood pressure or else implying that the other features of the phone are so frustrating that a feature was required to relieve the users' blood pressure this is likely a play on modern smartphones with built in heart rate/blood pressure sensors auto rotating case phones often feature an auto rotating screen meaning that the display switches between portrait and landscape mode depending on its orientation with respect to gravity but the case is a physical part of the phone so making a case that did not auto rotate with the phone would be the real challenge ribbed a reference to ribbed condoms which are often advertised as superior to standard ones because the texture can be more physically stimulating to the genitalia some other objects can be advertised with the word ribbed as well but mostly in the context where it allows a firmer grip on the device when wet since phones are usually not meant to be used wet this is a fairly useless feature may also be a reference to the first phone where the exterior may be frictionless waterproof interior only waterproofing is done to the outside to prevent water from getting in exactly what interior only means is unclear the case may be porous or it may prevent water from escaping but it's clear that the designers have missed the point googleable another non feature advertising asable is a way for marketing to add features without really adding features this may be for example a recyclable paper bag when paper is normally recyclable any term may be googled so being googleable is not an actual feature alternatively while googleable meaning being able to be googled is a non feature the related concept of being able to google is a legitimate feature that a phone may advertise as in having a google search app built in this is also a real feature in the sense that you can type google find my phone into google if you're logged in and your phone runs on the android operating system google will in fact find your phone to the precision allowed by gps and assuming it still has power cheek toucher the screen will touch your cheek when making a hand held phone call obviously a redundant/pointless feature to advertise cries if lost arguably a useful function as it would help the owner find the cellphone in case it was lost this is offset by how annoying it would sound if it happened to cry with a human voice may refer to people's habit of calling their own cellphones to help find it it also resembles the first xkcd phone's functions of 'screaming when falling' and 'saying hi when exposed to light' bug drawer this is most likely the cover for other ports though it looks like a small drawer capable of only holding bug sized items possibly a joke on software bugs which would being virtual rather than physical easily fit inside this area sd cards containing software bugs may also fit in this area may also be a reference to phone may attract/trap insects; this is normal from the original xkcd phone comic coin slot in most phones this would be the charging port payphones have coin slots not smartphones it is unclear what use such a feature would have or if it implies that the phone either cannot be recharged through this slot as usual or if cash payment is somehow required to charge the phone scroll lock a computer key on most keyboards which is practically never used this feature seems to be placed where a usual cellphone's home button is which would make it very frustrating despite a previous xkcd strip the scroll lock button was not invented by steven chu os by stackoverflowxc2xae stack overflow is a very useful and popular question/answer forum for programmers and many recent software products probably have benefited from advice given there so randall may be giving credit where credit really is due or it may be a reference to the rampant problem of code reuse where programmers use the pre written code on stack overflow rather than writing their own regardless of the fact that the code on stack overflow may contain bugs not be applicable to the programmer's situation or otherwise cause problems for their specific program alternatively it could be saying that the os was written by the people on stack overflow who go there with programming issues implying that the os was written from code that was posted as not working 3d materials all real materials are three dimensional so this feature is not special may be a reference to 880 headache in which cueball claims that 3d stuff aka the real world gives him a headache dog noticer can be interpreted as either alerting the user to nearby dogs or alerting nearby dogs of the user the former is very situational and the latter is probably a negative fitbitxc2xae fitness evaluator fitbit make wristbands that measure heart rate count user steps and act as an aid to planning an exercise program this comic is published on boxing day 26 december 2014 and is relevant as fitbits are a popular holiday gift at this time however the name fitness evaluator suggests that the product merely gives an evaluation on the user's fitness which may mean that in practice it only criticizes the user's weight diet etc another interpretation is that this monitors the fitness of the user's fitbit that is the state of the armband the person is wearing volume and density control a pun between volume as in speaker loudness and volume as in a physical property inversely related to density interpreting it as the latter apparently this feature would allow the user to change the size of the phone which would indeed be a very useful feature or a very worrying one thus changing the volume and the density it may be able to affect its mass instead of volume in some unexplained way note that some computer mice indeed have a feature where the user can put weights inside the case to customise the weight and thus actually affect its density   like the previous xkcd phone comic the title text continues the list of features  washable though only once  nothing prevents the phone from physically being washed however after the first time doing this the phone will obviously cease to function a play on phrases washing machine safe or dishwasher safe in real advertisements
