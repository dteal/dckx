n this comic is calling into question the reliability of wikipedia this is a favorite pastime of librarians and professional researchers and not usually one of randall's but to take it seriously for a moment people wikipedia is editable by anyone if you are doing serious work follow through the citations and decide which are from upstanding sources and which are just people writing on their blog and which are people writing on their blog who know what they are talking about the title of the comic is a play on the word cytogenesis cytogenesis is the formation of cells and their development citogenesis on the other hand is a portmanteau of 'citation' and 'genesis' a citation is a reference to a source used to back up a specific claim genesis means the origin of something  by extension citogenesis is the creation of text in a reliable source that can be cited to back up a claim the comic is discussing citogenesis occurring on wikipedia a free and freely editable encyclopedia that aims to become a comprehensive neutral compilation of verifiable established facts  wikipedia aims to provide only facts backed by reliable sources however this comic strip details a process in which wikipedia can not only spread misinformation but make said misinformation seem reliable through a process of circular reporting in this distorted process someone adds an untrue claim to an article in wikipedia a writer of some supposedly reliable source checks wikipedia for information and blindly relies on it without checking for proper sources eventually someone notices the claim in the reliable source and cites it in the wikipedia article the citation then lends further credence to the claim in wikipedia so the claim is more likely to be used by other reliable sources generating a positive feedback loop four years before randall commented on wikipedia about that process happening to him on a minor detail which probably indicates the inception of this comic  i've never referred to the boy in the barrel as barrel lad  that seems to have started in this wikipedia article i've called him barrel boy or the boy in the barrel minor detail but it's funny how sometimes something can appear on wikipedia get referenced in other places and then wikipedia cites those other places as supporting references hooray wikiality xe2x80x94 randall munroe as user xkcd enwikipediaorg/wiki/talkxkcd#notes_from_the_author 3 october 2007 in turn randall originated the untrue assertion in this comic that steven chu a physicist and at the time of the strip the us secretary of energy invented the scroll lock key a common button on computer keyboards since most people are aware of the scroll lock key but know little about its function or origins this false information would make for an interesting piece of trivia that would likely spread very quickly     following this comic the actual scroll lock and steven chu articles were both vandalized by helpful editors trying to project randall's reality on wikipedia the wikipedia article on citogenesis redirects to the information loop section on the article reliability of wikipedia  that section ends with crediting the term citogenesis to webcomic artist randall munroe with a link to this comic this now has three citations to make matters even more surreal some wikipedia editor once flagged the link to this xkcd comic as dubious the material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or non factual we haven't seen a book like the one randall describes in the title text  but one example of the misuse of wikipedia by reliable sources concerns the former german minister karl theodor zu guttenberg his complete name contains fifteen names/words and reads karl theodor maria nikolaus johann jacob philipp franz joseph sylvester freiherr von und zu guttenberg an anonymous user added one more wilhelm to the german wikipedia just the evening before karl theodor zu guttenberg was presented as the new federal minister of economics and technology on february 10 2009 the next day many major german newspapers published this wrong name translation of bildblogde
