n on the day this comic was posted september 30th 2016 the rosetta mission ended with the final descent of rosetta onto the comet 67p landing rosetta on the comet gave the scientists ponytail megan and hairy a chance to collect extra data from very close to the comet using the spacecraft's powerful sensors  cueball however assumed that the landing was a kinetic impact mission to deflect a comet that was on a collision course with earth a similar scenario but using a nuclear weapon implanted inside of the asteroid to deflect it was depicted in the 1998 film armageddon of which cueball is apparently a fan in reality at the time rosetta landed 67p was already leaving the inner solar system and was a long way past earth it will return to the inner solar system in around 5 years time but its orbit will not pass close of the earth in any forseeable time also as the title text hints rosetta's speed was only 90 cm per second relative to the surface at the moment of impact or about 2 mph/325 km/h; the speed of a slow walk while the comet was travelling at 1439 km/s given that rosetta only weighs a couple of tons or six horses and 67p weighs nearly 10 billion tons or 22 billion horses rosetta's landing will have no actual measurable effect on the comet's momentum rosetta and its lander philae were previously the subject of the comics 1402 harpoons and 1446 landing and were mentioned in 1461 payloads 1547 solar system questions and possibly 1621 fixion
