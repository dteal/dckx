n cueball is tricking megan by pretending to read from a book about a parasitic brain worm describing the apparent symptoms caused by an infection the dreams described sound very specific which leads megan to believe that since she has been having these types of dream she must be infected the comic text asserts that these types of dream are fairly common however and this knowledge can be leveraged to trick people who aren't aware of this dream contents are likely to be affected by many factors however because people share common thoughts feelings and experiences in waking life it is unsurprising that our dreams share common features in the case of the comic cars are a ubiquitous feature of life for most people and for many driving or being a passenger in a car is a regular experience it is therefore to be expected that cars are likely to feature in dreams what is less logical but still common is there being something strange about the situation the car may be huge tiny backwards upside down flying underwater non descript etc the examples given in the comic are typical of the 'unusual factor' reported in dreams some people believe to varying degrees that dreams may be interpreted as a representation of a persons thoughts emotions or their subconscious one of the more generally accepted interpretations of dreams involving driving or riding in a car is that it expresses how you feel about your control over your own life a dream about not fitting or not being comfortable in a car might be interpretted as the dreamer feeling out of place or uncomfortable in their own life while dreams about losing control of a car might indicate the dreamer feels their life is out of control megan of course does not have an infection from these fictional brain worms cueball is taking a shot in the dark with the success of his trick relying on megan recognising these dream types as ones she has experienced he may be playing on fears possibly carried by many people that these types of dreams hold a deeper significance which they can't identify in the comic megan appears not to realize that he is pulling a prank on her and begins to get scared the title text continues the joke with another common dream this time about teeth falling out one commonly accepted meaning of teeth falling out is a loss of confidence or power in one's life
