n another entry into the my hobby series o rly is an internet meme typically used to express sarcastic agreement with or feigned surprise at a statement the typical response to o rly is usually ya rly no wai or srsly these exchanges are sms abbreviations for oh really yeah really no way and seriously respectively however cueball's response avoids this typical exchange instead replying with another clichxc3xa9 derived from a classic double entendre in this clichxc3xa9 the speaker responds to a statement containing a word ending with ' er' and turns it into a sexual reference the setup is as follows   alan do you want to come over to my house my wife and i are playing poker  bob poker i hardly know her  such a double entendre makes no sense in the context of an o rly exchange in the case of the comic the non sequitur will likely baffle the person on the left and derail the conversation to the amusement of the person on the right the reason randall makes this a hobby is presumably that it bores him when people fall back on clichxc3xa9s for comedy and he seeks inventive ways to humor himself in these situations  see for example https//xkcdcom/16/ the title text takes the real clichxc3xa9 fight fire with fire and combines it with the more literal fight clichxc3xa9s with clichxc3xa9s the resulting statement follows a very similar principle to the situation in the comic proper also for some reason or another the &amp;eacute; does not evaluate to xc3xa9
