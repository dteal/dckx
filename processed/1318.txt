n the image shows a sphere a simple model for the shape of the earth six people stand on its surface talking about ways to best describe it starting with a flat surface the first belief held and ending with general relativity as the statements form a circle the very first statement can lead recursively off the last as described below the statements in detail  actually measurements suggest it's flat  this statement is located at the top of the sphere in the comic making it most likely to be read first given no other context it will be interpreted as referring to the earth; ie the earth is flat this references the earliest view of our planet's surface  actually it's a sphere  this refers to the second earliest view of our planet's surface as a ball with uniform radius everywhere  actually it's an oblate spheroid  this clarifies the previous statement; an oblate spheroid has a wider radius at the equator than through the poles on earth this occurs because a rotating body tends to bulge at the equator where the matter experiences greater centrifugal forces analogous to experiencing more force at the outside of a round a bout rather than at the center this is known as the equatorial bulge  actually it's a shape defined by the egm96 coefficients  this adds even more clarification to the previous statement; the earth gravitational model 1996 is a detailed map of the earth's gravitational field which is not as uniform as a pure oblate spheroid would suggest  actually it's that plus local topography  this adds an almost unnecessary level of clarification to the previous; obviously the earth's surface is not a smooth shape but rather contains numerous mountains hills valleys etc which constitute local topography  actually it's embedded in a universe that's curved   this shifts the perspective from the actual shape of the earth to the shape of the space around it according to general relativity our planet's gravity bends the space time around it making it curved at the time general relativity was discovered it was not conclusively known whether the whole universe was flat or curved  actually measurements suggest it's flat  looping around to the first statement and given the context from the previous one this can now be interpreted as the universe is flat rather than the earth is flat recent measurements of the universe's shape strongly suggest that it is more or less completely flat rather than curved this could also refer to thomas friedman's 2005 book the world is flat which discusses globalization and the idea of the world as a level playing field of equal opportunity for commerce  actually  the next two statements could also be interpreted as referring to the universe rather than the earth but they would no longer continue to be more precise than the previous cueball's statement the text will not continue on to form a recursive loop as the statement about the egm by megan would no longer make sense in context of the universe and the same would be true for the next two statements  title text  the title text pulls the whole comic together pointing out that each statement in the comic is more precise than the previous unlike the loop in the comic someone who does this will likely eventually win any real life debate the victory will not necessarily be a result of actually proving your logical argument however the phrase stand alone refers to driving away all conversation resulting in no one wanting to speak to the person
