n any american who went to high school remembers the convocations they had during football or basketball season in which class would be interrupted and everyone was crowded into the gymnasium for a pep rally cheerleaders would cheer they'd play the school fight song the cheerleaders might do a routine and the team would be introduced this is used to inspire school spirit and get people excited about attending the games so that they'd come to the games and spend money on tickets and concessions a common boast at pep rallies is our school is the best but wait says one of the students quite logically why is our school the best the student population is simply made up of students living in the general zip code of the school's location there's no intrinsic reason why this school is any better than the rest of them in any way that really matters in real life and even having the #1 basketball team in the state doesn't mean the students there are any better than anyone else this comic subverts the usual expectation of unanimous agreement with the cheerleader's sentiment and reminds you that people who go to other schools root for other teams aren't bad people xe2x80x94 and randall would no doubt argue that this is the same of people who follow a different religion than you are a different ethnicity or have a different political party affiliation the title text says that randall was weirded out by pep rallies growing up and now that he's older finds them even more creepy really if you think about it pep rallies are a less extreme example of any cult of personality gathering there are very arguably a lot of parallels between a high school pep rally and say a military rally under a brutal dictatorship&#91;citation needed&#93;
