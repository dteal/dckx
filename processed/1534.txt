n hairy offers cueball some beer from his fridge and cueball takes the opportunity to suggest that people should admit that beer tastes bad and stop pretending to like it hairy berates cueball for making such an affirmation and cueball admits defeat deciding to drink the beer anyway and pretend to like it to play his part in what he perceives to be a mass delusion there are two possible interpretations of this comic one is that cueball is right and that no one really likes beer and everyone is just pretending in order to fit in the other is that hairy actually likes beer but cueball fails to recognize that possibility assumes hairy is faking it and plays along in the case where cueball is correct the comic would imply that beer doesn't actually taste good and instead fits the definition of an acquired taste with most people initially pretending to like beer to conform to social norms and later internalizing this belief to prevent cognitive dissonance the theory is that this dissonance is perpetuated by advertising and peer pressure which present beer as a naturally pleasant beverage in this interpretation cueball having failed to break the mutual knowledge barrier admits defeat and joins hairy in pretending to enjoy beer the second case would mean that cueball mistaken in assuming that nobody likes beer either because he fails to empathize with those who have a different experience than his or because he's heard from other people who also admitted not to like beer and extrapolated that opinion to everyone perhaps assuming that such admissions are underrepresented due to the cultural bias in favor of drinking the title text expands on cueball's perspective stating sarcastically that he feels no peer pressure to like beer the pressure to drink beer or other alcoholic drinks is a well known phenomenon especially among adolescents and young adults
