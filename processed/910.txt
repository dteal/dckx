n choosing a name for a server is both an important and non trivial task it is non trivial enough that there are official communications on how to choose a good name and why many ideas are bad for example rfc 1178 name your computer it is important to pick a good name because changing it is costly once many reference to the existing name are widespread for example rfc 1178 states   if you later decide to change a name to something          sensible like you should have chosen in the first place you          are going to be amazed at the amount of pain awaiting you  no          matter how easy the manuals suggest it is to change a name you          will find that lots of obscure software has rapidly accumulated          which refers to that computer using that now ugly name  it all          has to be found and changed   so cueball wants to make sure that he chooses a great permanent name that he can give to the server he is running  when megan quips on how quickly cueball named their daughter caroline a living being that is the type of entity that would give the server purpose cueball retorts that he was under pressure at the time megan tried to name said daughter epidural in honor of the painkiller drugs that were being injected into her spine at the time megan tries to justify this by explaining that those were very good drugs but thus also confirms cueball in that she was drugged not in her right mind and thus not making good decisions despite epidurals working by stopping nerves in the spinal cord from transmitting signals and would not have an affect on the brain seen in someone given an opiate or narcotic she may however have been motivated purely by the fact that the drug stopped the pain of labor or a cesarean section in the title text cueball mentions that he thinks that it is easier to change a person's name than to change the hostname of a server because of the number of changes that would need to be made to each of the machines that would have saved the old name of the server it seems however that cueball has never had to wait in line at the social security administration office or at the department of motor vehicles as both of those events typically take excruciatingly long amounts of time
