n roomba is a brand of domestic cleaning robots manufactured by the company irobot the robots are designed to automatically vacuum floors although these robots are controlled by a quite simple software without any artificial intelligence some owners tend to humanize them in the same way that others humanize their pets there are several other comics related to a roomba megan presents a pet carrier to cueball the veterinarian assistant she says that her dog is xe2x80x9ccrawling around eating dirtxe2x80x9d which sounds like certain types of behavioral problems one encounters in dogs but is precisely what roombas are made for what makes the comic even more hilarious is that when the vet comments that it is a roomba megan responds that the device which has nothing to do with an animal is a cross breed and agrees that there probably is xe2x80x9csome roombaxe2x80x9d in it she thus acknowledges the existence of roombas but still treats them as if it were an animal it's common to talk about domestic dogs this way but cross breeding dogs with machines is impossible&#91;citation needed&#93; the vet then goes on to say with endless patience that a roomba is not a pet this is taken by megan as if the doctor said that her roomba like device is a non domesticated animal like a monkey a fox or the birds referred to in the title text that can but should not be kept in captivity in the last panel she consequently releases the vacuum cleaner and it whirs to its 'freedom' the second customer hairy has his dog on a leash but is also carrying a pet transporter for the dog most likely he has arrived with the dog in the transporter perhaps using public transportation but has now taken it out so it can walk for itself making the carrier much lighter the migratory bird treaty act from the title text contains a list of over 800 bird species that are not allowed to be captured or killed if the roomba were to be classified as a native american bird and were added to the list keeping them as pets would constitute capturing and would be considered illegal this of course shows how confused megan is she previously stated the roomba to be a dog and now apparently believes it is a bird even though dogs are not birds and the roomba is neither
