n youtube a video sharing site used to have an odd quirk in its view counter when a video hits 301 views the view counter briefly stops updating this means that youtube is checking the views to make sure that no foul play is going on the choice of the number 301 is due to a harmless off by one error; numberphile produced a video that explains all this very well at times the number 301 catches some youtubers off guard xe2x80x94 for very popular videos it may appear that the video has more likes than views youtube added a 301+ to indicate that the video has reached the 301 point and is awaiting review more recently however youtube has abolished this1 the author plays with the near coincidence of this number and a conspiracy theory entity known as the committee of 300 in this case the video's first 300 views come from each of the committee's council members who determine if the video will go viral the video is then released to the public by sending it to a regular person cueball in this comic making the total number of views 301 the title text elaborates on this by explaining that the council also hypnotizes somebody to make him think they uploaded and shared that particular video according to the title text the council does not seem to tolerate contradiction because the member that suggests changing 301 to a random number to avoid suspicion is shot and silenced permanently and removed from the council
