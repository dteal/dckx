n this comic makes fun of the fact that most mathematical geniuses have done their exceptional work for which they eventually become famous in their early years by exaggerating it particularly given that too old for this shit is a phrase more appropriately used by people later in age at the age of thirteen even precocious mathematicians would not be pushing the frontier of mathematical knowledge let alone to the point where they would be too old for it as such this is more a joke about a young boy attempting to dismiss the world around him it also plays on the fact that in xkcd comics it is often difficult to tell age because of lack of detail which is necessary to set up the final punchline  a striking example is carl friedrich gauss the famous mathematician who wrote his exceptional masterpiece disquisitiones arithmeticae at the early age of 21 this idea was for instance used in the fictional biography of gauss measuring the world where he admits to having trouble understanding his own work when he got older because of his age  the age theory' applies to physics as well albert einstein was also very young 26 when he published his four groundbreaking papers in the same year his annus mirabilis in 1905 including the one that eventually gave him the nobel prize later in life for instance he never accepted the theory of quantum physics which is now a very well established theory the title of the comic too old for this shit is also likely a reference to the lethal weapon series in which one of the main characters roger murtaugh played by danny glover is repeatedly quoted as saying things along the line of i'm too old for this shit the title text asserts that thirteen is way too old as it claims that mathematicians should do their great work at the age of eleven if not they will never do anything great
