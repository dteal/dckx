n when abbreviating the date into numerical form various areas of the world tend to list the year month and day in different orders as well as with different delimiting symbols which can cause confusion particularly when the day value is 12 or lower allowing it to be easily interpreted as the month and vice versa as a public service announcement this comic states that there is in fact one international standard for writing numeric dates set by the international organization for standardization in its iso 8601 standard the comic then proceeds to list several discouraged ways of writing out the date of the comic's publication as they do not match the standard it begins with several commonly used ones in countries around the world but then begins to list increasingly uncommon ways ranging from strange roman numerals to quirky binary unix time to essentially impossible painting the numbers onto a black cat the title text provides a perfect example of the kind of ambiguity that can arise when non standard formats are used the iso standard was in fact published on 1988 06 05 and amended on 2004 12 01 this is mentioned in the title text in mm/dd/yy format; however there is no way to naturally figure this out particularly with the second date with the year truncated to two digits and all three numbers at 12 or lower the date referring to december 1 2004 may well be interpreted as 12 january 2004 or as 2012 01 04 date formats was again the subject in 1340 unique date the other mentioned formats are     date   explanation    02/27/2013   mm/dd/yyyy used mostly in the united states    02/27/13   mm/dd/yy same as above but with the year shortened to two digits    27/02/2013   dd/mm/yyyy used variously in south america canada officially uses iso 8601 australia new zealand and europe    27/02/13   dd/mm/yy same as above but with the year shortened to two digits    20130227   yyyymmdd same as iso 8601 without delimiting punctuation allowed by the standard technically not ambiguous but is hard to read as a date at first glance    20130227   yyyymmdd used in japan same as iso 8601 except with different punctuation    270213   ddmmyy used in germany russia etc    27 02 13   dd mm yy used in denmark netherlands indonesia india bangladesh etc    27213   dmyy it is common in several areas to abbreviate the month or day to a single digit and drop the leading zero when possible    2013 ii 27   yyyy mm dd with month as roman numerals used in hungary    27xe2x81x842 13   dxe2x81x84m yy traditional format in sweden    2013158904109   year and decimal fraction of year 0158904109 is a decimal approximation of 58/365 with february 27 being the 58th day of the year allowed in iso 8601 as it is not ambiguous; presumably easier to read for computers/programs but difficult for humans    mmxiii ii xxvii   the iso 8601 standard but written in roman numerals never used as a traditional standard anywhere as it is hard to read parse and interpret for no benefit    mmxiii lviixe2x81x84ccclxv   year followed by its partial fraction 57/365 all in roman numerals equally useless as the above as a note apparently this 'standard' is different from the decimal fraction two rows above as the decimal fraction notation uses the end of the day first day of the year is 1/365 while the last is 365/365 while this uses the beginning first day is 0/365 and last is 364/365    1330300800   unix timestamp a standard method of storing absolute time in many computer systems and defined as the number of seconds since 000000 on 1970 01 01 utc the unix time listed here appears to mistakenly be for 2012 02 27 which is also mentioned by randall in the original transcript    3+3xc3x97111+1 1xc3x973/3 1/33   a useless format where the numbers 2013 2 and 27 written as needlessly long arithmetic expressions using just the digits 1 and 3 for additional confusion the values are delimited by slashes enabling confusion with the fraction bar  if evaluated literally the entire expression evaluates to 670963 or 671 minus 1 divided by 27
