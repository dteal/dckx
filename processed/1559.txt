n a self driving car is a car that requires no human interaction to navigate streets to a destination thus when black hat places a rock that weighs as much as a small adult into the car's seat he begins the process of fooling the car into thinking it has an occupant when it does not his purpose in doing so appears to be to send the car to anchorage alaska which is presumably quite far from where black hat and cueball are standing thus taking the car far away from its owner with relatively little effort on the part of black hat this is the kind of evil prank black hat is infamous for the title text references the fact that driving to alaska from the continental usa requires two border crossings once into canada from the mainland and once from canada into alaska the car apparently begins some distance from the canadian border since it will likely run out of gas before reaching canada title text expresses regret about this probable failure; perhaps randall was looking forward to the encounter between the border guards and the vehicle's occupant  however even if the car does not get to anchorage black hat will have created a serious problem for its owner who will have to report the car as stolen shortly after this comic appeared tesla released footage of a robotic charger that can connect itself to a tesla automatically if this kind of technology becomes common then a self driving electric car might be able to make a transcontinental journey without human intervention at the time of the release of this comic there were no places where self driving cars were for sale to individuals however several corporate owned test cars are frequently seen on public road such as those operated by google among others nevada florida california and michigan were the first states to allow the testing of self driving cars on public roads and this legality is quickly spreading to many other states as well as several countries in europe alternatively randall might be setting this comic in an idyllic near future wherein you could drive all over the country and in canada with these cars it could have been beret guy's car see 1493 meeting self driving cars is a recurring topic on xkcd
