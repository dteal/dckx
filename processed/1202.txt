n this comic is a play on the popular school yard taunt girls go to college to get more knowledge; boys go to jupiter to get more stupider also commonly heard as boys go to mars to get more candy bars; girls go to jupiter to get more stupider the words boys and girls may be interchanged depending on the gender of the person chanting the schoolyard taunt embodies the competitiveness and separation commonly seen between young boys and girls and ideas about the superiority of one's gender  the comic subverts the original rhyme by having both girls megan and boys cueball go to college to gain knowledge and then using that knowledge to go to jupiter as part of a space program working in cooperation with other men another cueball like guy and women ponytail going to jupiter to get more stupider is ironic considering that human beings have not yet even gone to mars so the ability to go to jupiter would take a huge amount of knowledge and investment and developing current technology further likewise people in space programs going to jupiter would definitely have advanced degrees a great deal of knowledge and a motivation to seek out more knowledge space programs and going to jupiter would require the cooperation of many different people men and women included rather than the divisive atmosphere of the schoolyard the title text points out that by going to jupiter you would get more knowledge which is generally the purpose of any space program that is to advance science and it wouldn't actually be dumb at all so the task of going to jupiter is absolutely dependent on going to college cooperation and getting more knowledge completely opposite of what the schoolyard taunt suggests; pointing this out is the reason for this comic going to jupiter was most famously explored in the film 2001 and its sequel 2010 where a space ship lands on the moon europa the film outland is set on a mining operation on jupiter's moon io
