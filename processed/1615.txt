n this comic is a take on the common stereotype that men who drive large expensive and/or ostentatious cars such as sports cars highly modified cars and lifted pick up trucks do so in order to compensate for insecurity about their manhood typically this is summarized as saying they are compensating for having small penises cyan is a greenish blue color that is not a basic color term in most languages it is the complementary color to red in the cmyk subtractive or rgb additive color models megan upon seeing hairy drive past in a red convertible tells cueball that hairy must be compensating for his cyan colored penis this comic thus generalizes the original stereotype to an assumption that men drive cars that compensate for problems/properties with their penis eg large car for small penis under this principle a red car would complement be the opposite of a cyan penis this is of course ridiculous as red cars are quite common and cyan penises either extremely rare or nonexistent; but maybe megan doesn't realize this there may also be a reference to the doppler shift where an object moving away such as a galaxy appears slightly redder than its true color on the contrary objects moving closer shift blue or cyan however cars cannot go nearly as fast to create a change in the perceived color in the title text another pair of opposites are mentioned acid and alkaline since acidity is only relevant in liquids and both cars and penises are usually solid this is an extremely odd property to try to compensate for with one's choice of car additionally most penises share the same basic chemical composition and therefore the same acidity if your penis can be described as highly acidic you probably have a major medical problem and should not be buying cars again this could be megan's lack of understanding and since some models of cars are called basic cars instead of a special red convertible she could make the wrong assumption that they drive a basic car to compensating for their acidic penises thus this comic is referring to the actual definition of compensation which means to balance something out by adding another if an image has too much red value on the rgb scale one could shift it more towards neutral by adding to the blue value and a solution with a low acidic ph can be neutralized by mixing it with an alkaline solution to bring its ph to a neutral value whereas a big car will not balance out a small penis&#91;citation needed&#93; an alternative interpretation to this just being about opposites is that of a more specific big vs small compensation in each case the car represents something larger than hairy's penis in the comic red has a bigger longer wavelength than cyan similarly in the title text alkali has a bigger higher ph than acid of course against this alternative is that red has a smaller energy/frequency than cyan and that you would often talk about stronger acids making a low ph count as strong not small finally the joke loses some value if it is still just a matter of big/small rather than actual properties of the penis that are being compensated for
