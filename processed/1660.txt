n at periodic intervals on a commercial flight the captain of the plane will address the passengers with information about the flight typically this will begin with this is your captain speaking and go on to describe the progress of the flight expected arrival time and other information about the flight such as if or when refreshments will be brought to passengers this comic takes this clichxc3xa9 and inverts it instead of the captain providing information the captain tells the passengers that he has apparently forgotten everything about the flight even down to what kind of plane he is supposed to be flying xe2x80x93 although he does think it is a boeing he at least discovers the flight number and then plans to use the consumer app flightaware that is made for tracking flights he thus hopes to be able to find out what the destination of xe2x80x9chisxe2x80x9d plane is but flightaware requires wi fi access so he goes on to ask the passengers if anyone know how to access the wi fi this app was earlier referenced in 1363 xkcd phone this even gets worse in the title text where he realizes that you have to pay for using the on board wi fi which means he is trying to access the same wi fi that the passengers have access to instead of using the on board wi fi that must be in the cockpit to which he is supposed to have free access instead of just paying he then asks the passengers if someone has already paid because then he would like to borrow their smartphone so he can check the flightaware app to find out where they are going options for explaining this scenario are  the captain is not a genuine pilot but has somehow found himself in the position of being in charge of an airplane this could be a reference to this earlier comic 726 seat selection the captain has genuinely fallen asleep and has forgotten what plane he is onbut he has thus also forgotten how to navigate determine his flight plan or communicate with air traffic control in the usa where xkcd cartoons are normally set there is normally at least a first officer and a flight attendant on the plane to support the captain the captain has been drugged and shanghaied onto the plane he is now expected to fly and land it for his employer but he has chosen to disclaim this fact to his passengers in the least reassuring manner possible after taking off the captain enters a dissociative fugue state losing his personal identity this may be in the future where auto pilot is so smart and do so much of the previous job of the pilot that future pilots might forget how to fly altogether the captain knows exactly where he is and where they are going and is playing a black hat style prank on his passengers  seeing as how planes cannot take off on auto pilot nor can they taxi but some can actually land and require a skilled awake human at the controls it is unlikely that this captain was responsible for take off; which must mean this auto pilot is much more advanced than current models likely a future model or that his first officer took off and then went away or asleep in the event a pilot falls asleep on medium sized planes ground  or proximity  radar would set off an alarm waking the captain if they are on a collision course whilst it is normal for the captain to sleep part of a long flight this can only occur if there are multiple pilots on the plane most flights are on auto pilot for hours at a time and the pilots serve primarily for takeoff landing and emergencies he is completely clueless having to use a consumer app and asking the passengers to get flight details instead of radioing for help as he probably should he would easily be able to get the information of where they are going by just asking any of the passengers though the fact that the captain is not sure of the flight number is not hard to imagine commercial pilots fly multiple flights per day and the numbers all run together after a while every radio communication starts with the flight number but if the captain has been out of commission for some time the flight number could easily be forgotten however he would probably know the aircraft type as commercial pilots are type rated for a specific aircraft type and with rare exceptions eg boeing 757/767 the type is specific to an airframe type this makes it more likely that he is not professionally qualified although he could just be rated for so many types of aircraft that it takes him a moment to determine which one is at hand though such a veteran pilot would be unlikely to have slept through takeoff or forget how to look up flight information from the cockpit three weeks later another plane related joke was released with 1669 planespotting where it is also an open question if the plane in the comic is actually a boeing
