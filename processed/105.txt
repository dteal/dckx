n cueball has by some ritual judging by the pentagram summoned himself from a parallel universe hairy suggests that cueball should take advantage of this rare opportunity and make out with his other self in the third panel hairy is suggesting that cueball should make out with him instead since he could also vanish at any moment the title text is ambiguous it could mean that cueball should not risk his other self disappearing or it could mean that the risk is hairy disappearing   alternative explanation  by a very big stretch of imagination we can think that the other person is megan instead of hairy ie a female instead of a male if the character is megan the third panel is her having reconsidered that she would rather cueball not make out with anyone other than her by threatening that she would leave him supposedly the title text does not help in deciding this if this alternative is correct or not if it is megan cueball should stay safe and not make out with himself if it is not he should play it safe and make out now before his alternate self goes back to the parallel universe all this ambiguity suggests a third joke perhaps there are two universes that this is playing out in in one of them the character is megan the other is not it could also be noted that the universe the parallel universe that the comic takes place in is not of the normal comics and that the cueball summoned could be of the standard comics in this universe hairy could be the replacement for megan
