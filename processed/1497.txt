n this comic points out an apparent paradox in product performance many products that are criticized by techies when first announced go on to great success and many that are heavily hyped are total flops the product in question may be a reference to the apple watch which was announced around the time of this comic's release     if they say   explanation   example   it doesn't do anything new  a product that  doesn't do anything new may still be successful for a variety of reasons it may in fact do something new that the engineers and programmers are overlooking or it may simply be a better presentation of an older idea that so far hasn't caught on among the general public this latter category is the completion of the life cycle mentioned later in the comic those products whose ideas will show up in something successful  ipod ipad   why would anyone want that  if engineers and programmers can't figure out why anyone would want a product it may be because the applications are highly avant garde or niche though that could make it hard for the product to be a mass success alternatively engineers and programmers themselves often don't share the tastes and priorities of non technical people and are therefore unable to understand and accurately assess the appeal that a product will have to the masses  twitter macbook air   really exciting  products that are really exciting to engineers and programmers so much so that they have already pre ordered them may fail to succeed for various reasons such as the product is excellent but costs too much for mass audiences the product has an unintuitive interface or strange aesthetics which techies are willing to live with but regular people are not the product has bad marketing; the masses never get how good the product is the product turns out to be nerd bait or vaporware offering visionary ideas that aren't actually feasible yet  when a later product is based on the same ideas but without the mistakes it will be worth billions then the techies will say it doesn't do anything new   next   i've already preordered one  myidkey ubuntu_edge    wait are you talking about &lt;unfamiliar person's name&gt;'s new project  if a product's developer's name is well known among engineers and programmers but not among the general public that's usually not a good sign quite likely the developer is someone who goes a step further than those in the previous category not just announcing something cool and exciting they can't follow through on but doing so knowing that they can't follow through yet still taking people's money the state may press criminal charges against them for fraud or such or the angry investors may sue to get their money back  shawn fanning   i would never put &lt;company&gt; in charge of managing my &lt;whatever&gt;  if engineers' and programmers' only objection is that they don't like the company behind the product that's basically a tacit admission that there's nothing else wrong with it for the average consumer the perks of a groundbreaking new product outweigh whatever problems they may have with the company behind it this category also relates to the numerous privacy concerns raised about the devices and software of certain companies and the way people tend to get riled up about these issues and then forget about them once it becomes too inconvenient for instance a few months ago in the aftermath of facebook releasing its messenger app it would not be uncommon to hear people say i would never put facebook in charge of managing my network connectivity/phone calls/camera however 6 months later and barely anyone is complaining anymore and within another year or so even the most hardline of privacy advocates will probably give in  take your pick  the title text imagines a product that fits into the second third and fourth categories    wait is that kim dotcom's new project xe2x80x94 third category  i'm really excited about it and already signed up xe2x80x94 both options from the second category  although i'm a little nervous about whether everyone should hand over control of their medical xe2x80x94 fourth category  kim dotcom is a controversial entrepreneur and convicted fraud he changed his surname to dotcom because of the dot com stock market bubble that made him a millionaire he fits perfectly into the mold of someone well known to programmers and engineers as well as new zealanders but perhaps not so much to your average joe taken together these imply that an untrustworthy and potentially malicious company has an exciting new idea that may eventually come out in successful form gains control of a large amount of medical information but ultimately result in lawsuits not just from investors but from misled consumers category 3 because the initial release will be a flop category 2 there is some time to prepare before the successful use of this idea becomes a reality also category 2 at which point that or some other company will gain control of a large amount of people's medical something category 4 once this happens you could expect dramatic repercussions; this is why the title text suggests to dig a bunker while there is still time
