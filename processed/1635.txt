n the comic shows cueball walking and singing along with the songbird singing above him; cueball is apparently enjoying the perfect weather and the birdsong as he comments on both in the next panel the bird continues to sing but now it sings actual words to the song smooth official video by santana featuring rob thomas this gives the word songbird a completely new meaning the bird's singing begins to annoy cueball so he chases the bird with a butterfly net in an attempt to catch it meanwhile the bird just continues with the song interestingly the two lines from the last two panels follow each other in the song but cueball manages to get hold of the net in between the lines the bird sings are most of the last three lines from the chorus see the lyrics  and it's just like the ocean under the moon well that's the same as the emotion that i get from you you got the kind of loving that can be so smooth yeah gimme your heart make it real or else forget about it  the comic is a play on the words bird and song  songbirds of course don't actually sing the sounds they make are territorial challenges mating cries etc but in western cultural traditions particularly the pastoral one imagining these sounds as 'song' is part of seeing nature as beautiful and harmonious ironically the fact that this bird is really singing pop music is perceived by cueball to be an intrusion in the title text cueball suggest playing pastoral music to 'reprogram' the bird which is of course an even more unnatural intervention all with the purpose of restoring the pastoral naturalness of the nature of course some birds can actually emulate human words and in this way also sing real words like with the common hill myna other birds can mimic any odd and unusual sounds particularly the lyrebird of australia is known to reproduce all types of sounds from chainsaws to barking dogs and certainly also music the title text of reprogramming the bird by placing it in a box also refers to bf skinner and his development of programmed learning through his theories of operand conditioning and behaviorism in psychology by famously using birds in so called skinner boxes he conditioned birds to respond to certain stimuli and expect rewards for particular behaviors leading to an understanding of many impulsive behaviors in humans like addiction cueball apparently hopes to correct the bird and its song through this method lately randall has had his characters catch several things but never butterflies with a butterfly net; most recently in 1622 henge where it was the sun that was caught in the net
