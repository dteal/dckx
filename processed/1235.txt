n displayed is a timeline chart showing the percentage of people in the united states who have a camera at every moment randall refers to the fact that today most people carry embedded camera devices using their cell phones or the even more modern smartphones the chart shows that after the 1980s the percentage increases rapidly almost reaching 100% by 2013 the text below the image states that we have conclusively settled the questions of flying saucers lake monsters such as the loch ness monster ghosts and bigfoot implying that because almost everyone carries a camera the evidence should have arisen by now to settle any question about such phenomena of course such evidence has not arisen xe2x80x94 but that doesn't stop many people from continuing to believe the myths but at least now it is hard to claim that you saw something but didn't have a camera to capture it with if something moved by so fast that you did not have time to take a picture then it could also be questioned if you have time to see that it was a ghost etc the title text declares that in the case of ghosts only the questions regarding phenomena that can be captured with a camera have been settled leaving in other words ghosts that can't be seen heard or felt and essentially indistinguishable from an absence of ghosts the title text also makes a joke about the ghosts of ghostbusters a popular film that featured highly visible and noisy ghosts which left a slime if such ghosts existed recording them would be very easy
