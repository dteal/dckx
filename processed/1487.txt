n a merry go round or carousel is an amusement ride consisting of a slowly rotating circular platform with seats for riders these seats are traditionally wooden horses merry go rounds usually rotate slowly as it is considered a children's ride the implication is that a tornado have made a merry go round spin much faster creating the fun and awesome experience described by the news commentator in reality such an event would most likely destroy the merry go round or at least damage it in a way that would keep it from spinning such as by breaking an axle or bearing barring damage to the merry go round itself if the tornado caused it to spin much faster than normal anyone riding it at the time would likely be thrown off and injured due to the increased centrifugal force the title text refers to the spinning teacup ride which consists of several circular units teacups that seat several people each they rotate around their center axis while simultaneously orbiting the center of the entire ride exposing people to acceleration in rapidly shifting seemingly random directions the second tornado system as reported in the title text had multiple vortices similarly rotating around a common center that attached themselves to each of the teacups also spinning them faster than normal operation of the ride would have this is of course even less likely to happen and to result in no injuries if it did than the single vortex tornado on a merry go round
