n tensile strength represents how hard you can pull on something without it breaking shear strength represents how hard you can try to cut it without it breaking many materials have great tensile strength but low shear strength such as dental floss xe2x80x94 try to break it by just pulling on two ends including whatever this space elevator is made of the material clearly has extremely high tensile strength because it can hold the elevator in place with one end on the ground and one in space but it can be cut with a simple pair of pruning shears this also highlights the fact that shear strength and shears are etymologically related a space elevator is a proposed construction that would make space travel easier it consists of a long string attached to the earth near equator on one end and a counterweight beyond the geostationary orbit on the other end kept taut and in one place by the gravity and centrifugal forces this would make it possible to carry spacecraft into the orbit by simple mechanical means as opposed to requiring the use of rockets as is the case nowadays saving lot of energy and resources the title text makes the point that even before black hat cut the space elevator's cable in two it was ruined by the holes in it for the banner the holes would reduce the surface area of the cross section of the pole dwarfing its ability to keep the elevator attached to the ground the flag and holes would also potentially make it impossible for the elevator to travel up the pole making the entire elevator useless
