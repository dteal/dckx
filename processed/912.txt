n there are two jokes in this comic the first is that the pilot typed man override to manually override the plane's computer and steer the plane to safety but instead he ends up opening the manual page for override the second joke is making fun of a trend in documentation for unix like systems using the free gnu toolchain historically unix systems had a way to access descriptions of the available programs by using the man command from manual typing man program name would output a concise helpful text called a man page describing the program's functionality available command line options a list of related programs etc for some gnu based systems however the output of man program name will be entirely too brief mainly telling what the program does then directing the user to invoke a gnu specific information system gnu info gnu info pages can be quite useful eg they often contain much more information than man pages and are hypertextual allowing quick navigation through a network of content related info pages; however they often are much more complex to search through than simple man files which take the form of single scrollable pages one per program as such the humour is predicated upon understanding the frustration which sometimes arises when gnu/linux users seek out a man page hoping for an easy digestible read only to find that the man page they opened merely redirects them to another less accessible network of hypertext info pages this can be especially annoying when it interrupts a person's workflow; eg when what they wanted was to spend three seconds looking up the proper format of a particular command line function and instead they end up redirected to a maze of detailed documentation to add injury to the insult sometimes the info pages aren't actually installed causing the info viewer to just render the same old man page that had the directions in the first place the title text provides a tongue in cheek correction to the comic's title suggesting that rather than typing manual override the user/pilot should type info override to search gnu info instead
