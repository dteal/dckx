n beret guy has a new job with a paradoxical premise when asked where he works he says antique factory which is an oxymoron since one cannot build an antique object directly in a factory only when the item is old enough to be worth more than its original price and will often have to have been in use during this time period can it be called an antique at the factory beret guy walks up to a chair a table and a small cabinet then simply sits down in the chair and does nothing else of course one does not simply make or manufacture antiques instead one must wait beret guy appears to be doing exactly this the implication is that the antique factory is simply a place where furniture is stored until it becomes old enough to be considered antique and that beret guy doesn't perform any useful function except perhaps using the items to make them look old and worn or keeping an eye on the inventory so it won't be stolen the title text refers to allergy warning labels saying may contain nuts more specifically they may say manufactured in a facility which also processes nuts manufactured on equipment that also processes nuts or similar these warnings indicate that bits of powder and oil from nuts may have been mixed into the product creating a hazard to people with nut allergies sometimes these warnings are used for allergens besides nuts but nuts are likely the most common the joke here is that of course the time that has passed for a specific item to become an antique will be the same time that has also passed while some nuts somewhere have grown thus the time that has inexorably passed to make a specific item antique will also have processed nuts beret guy has previously traveled into the future in 209 kayak
