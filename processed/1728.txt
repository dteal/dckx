n on unix like systems cron is a system utility that runs tasks on a schedule  this program has been around since the early days of unix and has not changed much it is still one of the most widely used functions in modern operating systems  many administrative tasks on servers are automated using cron including monitoring and updates when a cron job produces output cron's default behavior is to send an email to the user account under which the job ran  however in most situations an email address has not been set up for that user so the email is instead written to a mailbox file  most unix shells will notify the user with a message like you have new mail when this mailbox file is updated but if the user doesn't know how to check this mail file they will likely just ignore the message in this case cueball has been ignoring his mailbox for fifteen years  when he finally learns where to look he discovers more than a gigabyte worth of messages from the cron program the vast majority of which are likely meaningless  ponytail suggests that cueball fix your cron likely meaning to fix the task that's generating the output so that it doesn't do so then set a parameter that tells cron to send email to an address he actually checks  he could also opt to direct the mails to /dev/null which would discard them or simply disable the mail in the crontab  cueball however interprets the tremendous amount of email as spam and decides to redirect the emails to /etc/crontab the main configuration file that contains all of cron's scheduling information  he apparently believes that this will either stop the emails or cause cron to spam itself instead in reality this will not cause significant problems as the mailto environmental variable in cron takes an email address or usernames on the local system and attempts to send emails to them  it will not write or append output to a local file like /etc/crontab  thus when cron attempts to email /etc/crontab the mail program cron uses will generate an error saying it can't find the user /etc/crontab  for example if you create the following crontab   mailto=/etc/crontab  * * * * * echo &quot;some output from a cronjob&quot;  installed on a user named me on a system called mycomputer then you will see a new error messages email to you located in /var/mail/me stating it can't send email to a user named /etc/crontab and the undelivered email is being returned to the sender  the error email will look like the following    from mailer daemon  tue sep  6 144701 2016 return path &lt;&gt;
