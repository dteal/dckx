n this comic plays off the american colloquialism bring home the bacon which generally means to work hard and bring money home to your family to put food on the table if a man is out of work he may be stressed out about how to bring home the bacon  some men would not be assuaged if their wife takes over but at first it seems that white hat is happy that his wife who work as a pharmacist does bring home the bacon and he tells this to cueball later however cueball finds out that what white hat actually was saying was thebacon which is a common name for dihydrocodeinone enol acetate an opioid commonly market under names like acedicon and diacodin as a pharmacist white hat's wife has easy access to such drugs and this may be the reason that he is so calm because his wife supplies him with painkiller drugs  thebacon is compared to the better known drug vicodin another opioid sold as a painkiller which can and often has become a drug of abuse the title text lists what randall assumes to be the normal pronunciation for thebacon according to wikipedia randall seems to be mistaken in no less than three places which seems to indicate that randall has only passing knowledge of the drug and did not do extensive research beforehand  the proper name is dihydrocodeinone enol acetate not dihydrocodeine enol acetate  it is a semisynthetic opioid not a synthetic opioid the pronunciation is /xcbx88xcexb8ixcbx90bxc9x99kxc9x92n/ thee buh kon not theh buh kon by saying i assume randall indicates that he didn't research the pronunciation as an alternative explanation there may be a joke/pun in the mistake
