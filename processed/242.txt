n cueball pulls a lever a bolt of lightning comes down and strikes him after being dazed for a moment the comic then takes one of two routes; the first is that of a normal person and the second is that of a scientist a normal person would decide not to pull the lever any more because it seems to cause him to get struck by a bolt of lightning but a scientist would pull the lever again to see if it was just a coincidence or if the lever actually caused the bolt of lightning a scientist requires that results be repeatable before he accepts the results the title text refers to the scientist's method of pulling the lever again and again trying to understand how the machine works as opposed to the normal person just avoiding pain
