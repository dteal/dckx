n the comic reveals discriminative jargon against women when doing tasks such as mathematics when a guy does something wrong it's his own mistake when a girl does something wrong it is taken as a confirmation that girls are inferior the mathematics displayed is neither semantically nor syntactically correct to begin with there should most likely be a dx after x2 now we have an indefinite integral on the left hand side the answer xcfx80 is just nonsensical what we want is a function whose derivative is x2 now x3/3 satisfies this condition however since adding a constant to a function does not change its derivative the full answer is any function of the form x3/3 + c where c is any fixed number the plus a constant part is very easy to forget and might even be omitted by a sloppy professional mathematician so if someone really gave the answer xcfx80 you forgot to add a constant would be a pretty funny remark because in one way it's true but on the other hand it wouldn't quite be the main thing to worry about it is especially inane as pi itself is a constant so pi + c would simplify down to just c it would also be possible to fix the equation by adding bounds of integration so that xcfx80 becomes the area below a section of the curve x2 that is called a definite integral and there would be no + c the bounds would have to be somewhat awkward though; if 0 was the lower bound the cube root of 3xcfx80 would have to be the upper
