n the comment to which cueball is referring is a tweet by neil degrasse tyson an american astrophysicist and science communicator as of this comic tyson is the frederick p rose director a special honorary title of the hayden planetarium he has appeared on many different shows ranging from the discovery channel to the big bang theory there are a number of conspiracy theories claiming that the moon landing was a hoax tyson offers a pretty compelling argument against them but megan presents an even more convincing refutation snarkily implying that nasa really hasn't done anything spectacular since 1969 and cueball responds with a pun on the word burn burn can mean a particularly effective insult or it can mean the consumption of fuel for propulsion in this case the burn was so effective it pushed the spaceship out of orbit which usually takes a very large amount of burning depending on the gravity of the planet or moon in the title text randall mentions many successful nasa unmanned missions  the mars rovers spirit and opportunity which landed in 2004 opportunity has been working for over ten years on the surface of mars; spirit got stuck in 2009 and shut down for good in 2010 see this comic 695 spirit kepler found many exoplanets new horizons is a mission to the dwarf planet pluto and beyond it did a flyby of pluto in july 2015 and is on its way out of the solar system cassini is a probe orbiting saturn since 2004 curiosity is another larger mars rover exploring the martian surface since august 2012 time is a proposed mission to explore the oceans of saturn's moon titan project m is an idea to send human like robots to the moon  the final sentence of title text notes that all manned missions since the moon landings have taken place in low earth orbit which is barely far off of the earth's surface if the earth were scaled to the size of a regulation basketball approximately 24&#160;cm 9xc2xbc inches in diameter those manned missions would have all taken place within 125&#160;cm xc2xbd inch of the ball's surface at this scale the moon would be at a distance of 77&#160;m 253&#160;ft unmanned missions such as those named above or the voyager and mariner probes of the 1960s and 1970s have travelled much further
