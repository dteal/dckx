n complex computer programs often incorporate a numbering system for errors that are anticipated might occur this way the code can be referenced to tech support so that there is some feedback from the program as to what is wrong akin to a car dashboard with multiple lights telling you if you have a battery problem or an engine problem or a cooling problem etc most people have seen at least one error code in their life perhaps the most famous error code is seen in web browsers 404 not found another code is 403 forbidden the guy at the computer gets the error41 but cannot tell even what program it comes from so the other guy decides to look up the code in a book apparently called error codes the book then indicates to go to a lake instead of how to resolve the computer problem which seems like a great solution because it would be very relaxing the panel with the image of the lake is fairly rare as far as xkcd comics go in that it is approaching a photorealistic picture  the beep codes referenced in the title text refers to the error codes produced by motherboards because the motherboard is sort of the heart of the computer the designers apparently did not want to rely on any form of error display that might be compromised by the error itself ie a visual display instead motherboards typically have a code consisting of beeps from the system pc speaker which is expected to work without error in most situations as it's wired directly to the motherboard in a sort of morse code type system certain lengths and numbers of beeps refer to different errors like memory problems video card problems etc the one quick beep that occurs on boot sequences is the post power on self test beep which detects vital parts of the system like motherboard memory monitor etc the beep indicates that everything necessary to boot is present anyone who has built a few computers is probably familiar with less happy beep sequences it is possible randall wanted comic number 1024 to be about computers because 1024 is a significant number in computer systems it is exactly 210 and as such is sometimes used instead of 1000 as the power constant for file sizes for the sake of easier binary arithmetic this was referenced in 1000 1000 comics
