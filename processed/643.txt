n this comic deliberately conflates the origin story of the comic book superhero of spider man with the origin of ohm's law as both the origin story of spider man and ohm's law deal with power though the power is of different types in the origin story of spiderman peter parker who would become spider man is raised by his aunt may and uncle ben when parker goes through various stages of teenage angst and rebellion his uncle ben in different situations depending on the comics and/or movie advises him that with great power comes great responsibility here power is taken by the reader to refer to parker's superhero powers acquired from a bite from a radioactive spider and via various technologies parker designs himself it is to be noted however that uncle ben doesn't know about these powers in the origin stories and only means this as general advice in contrast in this xkcd comic ohm's law is supposedly delivered to georg ohm by a similar authority figure in the form of relating current and resistance to power in the unit of watts where power is defined as the change in energy per unit time in real life ohm obviously was never advised about the law but instead determined experimentally that current through an ohmic resistor was proportional to the voltage  this relationship is summarized by ohm's law  voltage = current x resistance v=ir  electric power is defined as  power = current x voltage p=vi joule's first law which by replacing voltage with current x resistance from ohm's law power = current x current x resistance = currentxc2xb2 x resistance which leads to the power equation alluded to in the comic  the joke here is that given the proportionality by definition a great amount of power would involve a great amount of current and/or resistance squared as here the phrase 'great power' could be taken to mean 'a large capability to do things' or 'a numerically large quantity of electrical power' there is also humor in the improbability of this scenario the comparison with spider man as well as the suggestion that it was how ohm derived his eponymous law the title text takes this further by redefining the power equation as a more generalised differential equation which simply states that power is proportional to the change of energy per unit time de/dt which is another way of stating that power = energy per unit time in many engineering and physics books the differential form is presented as the general form from which a specific algebraic form can be derived as the differential form is more adaptable to special cases and therefore more general and so the title text extends the conflation of physical power and electrical power to a more generalised form
