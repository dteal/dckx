n this comic is a reference to all of the companies that rolled out cloud services like google's and amazon's music service and apple's aptly named icloud online backup service around the time that the comic was released despite the mental image people using cloud services have of their data being placed literally in the sky the reality is that all the data in the cloud has to be stored somewhere sometimes being merely a server black hat claims that the various cloud services are all ultimately provided by his server when cueball expresses skepticism that black hat has enough bandwidth to make that possible he explains that it's done by caching caching is an arrangement whereby some data is stored locally in order to reduce the need to retrieve it from more distant storage however it would require an unrealistically efficient level of caching to reduce the overhead requirements of the world's cloud storage networks to a level that could be accommodated by black hat's non enterprise class cable modem  and if it could be done it would simply transfer the load to other servers ie cueball's description of the cloud as it exists in the real world the title text refers to the roomba which is a small round battery powered vacuum cleaner that runs automatically around the house the roomba begins to learn the dimensions of rooms however apparently it has never learned to avoid running over the cord pulling it free of the socket and cutting power to the server the regular nightly downtime is a reference to an urban legend in which some critical piece of equipment often a server is unplugged regularly so that a vacuum cleaner or similar janitorial tool can be temporarily plugged in although the roomba vacuum does not require this computer's outlet running over the cord apparently causes similar interruption in service probably unplugging the cord requiring it to be plugged in again this comic is reminiscent of the british sitcom the it crowd in which they showcase a box that they make the rest of their non tech coworkers believe is the internet the last panel showcases both black hat's stereotypical sadism and callousness when cueball asks about the hazard namely tripping implicit in a cord stretching across a room black hat responds by implying no one would want to do that because it's unpleasant cueball responds with the fact that some people do things by accident to which black hat says he doesn't know anyone like that the only way cueball can disprove this at least quickly is by admitting he's one of those people opening him up to black hat's ridicule alternatively this could be a hint towards how black hat being the sadist he is would accidentally trip over the cord purposefully causing downtime and subsequent unpleasantness to those who rely on the cloud a proposition supported by the title text there are some connections with both 1117 my sky and the title text of 1444 cloud and especially the april fools' day comic 1506 xkcloud
