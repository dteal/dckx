n a part of the my hobby series this describes a distributed computing network using an automated system to simultaneously run trillions of tamagotchis as with most of the my hobby series the concept would work and is closely connected to real world activities but twisted enough to make it inherently absurd a tamagotchi is a keychain sized virtual pet simulation game from 1996 ostensibly for children they had appeal for people of all ages the characters are colorful and simplistically designed creatures based on animals objects or people beginning with the 2004 tamagotchi plus/connection a second wave of tamagotchi toys emerged featuring a different graphic design by jinco and gameplay which elaborated upon the first generations however the story behind the games remained the same tamagotchis are a small alien species that deposited an egg on earth to see what life was like and it is up to the player to raise the egg into an adult creature the creature goes through several stages of growth and will develop differently depending on the care the player provides with better care resulting in an adult creature that is smarter happier and requires less attention gameplay can vary widely between models and some models such as tamagochu require little to no care from the player tamagotchi has a shrinking fan base distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems a distributed system is a software system in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages the components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal examples of distributed systems vary from service oriented architecture based systems to multiplayer online games to peer to peer applications distributed computing is often used for tasks that require resources which would otherwise be impossible or prohibitively expensive to manage with single computers this may include large bitcoin network mining operations the worldwide lhc computing grid or yes running trillions of simultaneous tamagotchis using an ai protocol that said using ai to keep trillions of tamagotchis perfectly taken care of is a complete waste of time; the whole point of tamagotchi is the challenge of caring for the digital pet yourself the singularity in the title text refers to the technological singularity; a concept prevalent in science fiction and discussions of artificial intelligence ai the idea is that ai would become so sophisticated compared to a human brain that no human would be able to predict its behaviour motivations etc from that point onward and potentially human history after that point would therefore become unpredictable as ais would play dominant roles in determining its direction it uses the metaphor of a mathematical singularity which is a point where established rules can no longer apply for example in a black hole or during the big bang physical conditions are such that the physical laws we use can no longer meaningfully predict what happens an ai that is more sophisicated than a human brain could presumably then simulate human brains within itself making it possible to upload human consciousness into a machine simulated environment see simulated reality and the simulation hypothesis thus much science fiction that is based on the idea of the singularity also focuses on the creation of a virtual world that much of the human race decides to plug itself into much like the tamagotchi hive that randall has created randall's mind and the processing power in his computer is far greater than any individual tamagotchi mind so simulating tamagotchis becomes trivial for randall and no tamagotchi could predict or control its own history with randall around in a humorous analogy with the singularity concept
