n this comic is a continuation of the previous comic about a time traveler from the future who has come to see spiders see 1747 spider paleontology for a more complete explanation of this part of the joke  the idea is that history is filtered in similar fashion to fossils  what is contemporaneously important like a spider's web dinosaur feathers or the united states presidential election may not survive  bandwidth limits may pass seemingly less important but much simpler features like chitin exoskeleton tooth bone and flood meme the joke is that in the future the 2000 aaron carter pop song that's how i beat shaq lyrics video is considered as valuable a historical document when researching humans as the biblical story of noah's flood while secular historians consider the story of the flood to be mythical they still use it to infer facts about the early history of the middle east simply because there are a fairly small number of texts surviving from that era that's how i beat shaq is likewise a fictional story including some true elements; it's just that as long as there are abundant sources documenting life in the year 2000 there's no reason to consult the song in any historical context yet it is the latter story that the time traveler assumes to be a clearly religious one while seeing the former as a relatively straightforward survival story a further layer of humor is that that's how i beat shaq is an archetypal david and goliath story&#8212;the story of david and goliath of course being a biblical one as well the title text expands on the joke by saying that the future archaeologists connected the two historical documents via the biblical story of moses moses next man specifically chosen by god after noah and abraham; the two stories appear close together in the bible though not close together chronologically also had an older biological brother named aaron; the future species has hastily concluded that moses' brother and aaron carter are one and the same according to the bible god parted the red sea for moses and the israelites; this is often referred to either erroneously or out of simplification as moses having parted the red sea along with noah's flood this is one of the two major times in the bible that god effects grand change on a body or bodies of water both this comic and the previous one have titles of a noun followed by a field of research  this comic was published the day after the what if flood death valley thus referring indirectly to a new possible flood history it was the first what if post in almost three month the longest break between two post during 2016 and third longest of all time at the time of its release and it thus seems realistic that there should be some kind of connection between that and this comic
