n this comic is a reference to the satirical novel flatland a romance of many dimensions in which a society of flat shapes live in a 2d world half the book is a direct satire of victorian society and the other half explores the experience of discovering a new dimension where a sphere introduces a square named a square to 3d cueball appears to have taken the place of this sphere and the comic takes place after the square knows the third dimension exists humans will never fully be able to grasp the concept of a four spatial dimensions at least not in the foreseeable future but there are ways of squashing or slicing four dimensions to create partial visualizations of 4d space miegakure is a 4d game that uses cross sections of 4d space cueball attempted to play it but after having his mind blown he gained more sympathy for a square who'd had similar trouble understanding 3d a square accepts his apology the joke here is that cueball was being silly and drew lines on a square to make him look like spongebob which did not make the square happy cueball apologizes again the title text is a third apology for when cueball crawled down into the second dimension being a stick figure he is comprised of a circle and straight lines in flatland circles are priests flatland's highest social level and all women are lines; thus to a watcher in flatland cueball would look very much like a priest above many connected women which may look like a lesbian orgy
