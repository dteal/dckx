n after being cooped up working on papers cueball goes to a party only to find himself tuning out the gossip of his friends in order to work on math problems in his head he writes down the prime numbers on cards and then stretches them out such that the area of the card is the same say 1 but one of the sides has been elongated to a length equal to the number on the card this reduces the length on the other dimension to the reciprocal of the number on the card ie 1/n with n being the number on the card according to the area formula for rectangles stacking these reciprocals all up will eventually diverge meaning the sum will be infinite without ever leveling off this is referred to as the divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes and was proven by euler in 1737 the cambridge aspergers test includes questions on preferences for and ability to cope with social situations it also asks the person taking the test if they have an affinity for numbers and see patterns in every day objects cueball would score high on the asperger's scale xe2x80x94 or he could just be introverted thinking about things on one's own is often relaxing for an introvert while hanging out with other people is not hence the irony of the comment in the last panel cueball's friends fail to realize that hanging out with them is actually more stressful for him than doing math especially when people are doing nothing but talking negatively about those not present the title text mentions people that talk negatively about people that aren't there which isn't uncommon a much later comic; 1176 those not present is about just that
