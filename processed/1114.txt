n the comic explains how weapons would really behave if they were made out of unusual materials in fantasy stories using unusual materials for weapons traditionally makes the weapons more powerful and cooler despite limited explanation for exactly why materials of extraterrestrial origin are so superior to their earthen counterparts the first panel is a reference to a fairly common fantasy trope the use of iron meteorites for making weapons and armour for example the sword brisingr of the inheritance series anglachel in the tolkein legendarium or the bear's armour in pullman's northern lights the quality of such metal can be rather hit and miss on one hand iron from meteorites was often mixed with terrestrial iron in the early stages of human development to create relatively high quality steel for swords undeveloped metalworking techniques at the time meant that extraterrestrial metal was often more refined and plentiful than man made metal ingots with that in mind however research has shown that meteorites have an abundance of the chemical element antimony sb which by itself is a very brittle metal and therefore swords forged from metals harvested from meteorites may not be as strong as lore would have one think  the second panel is a reference to stories set in middle earth and the sword is sting which glows blue when orcs are near sting used to belong to bilbo baggins; when he grew old he gave it to frodo baggins as a gift the dagger in question though glows because of the radioactive properties of actinium ac which is also highly toxic definitely not a dagger you would want to carry around for your every day battles the word eldritch in the third panel means sinister ghostly or magical the fourth panel mentions that the weapon gives a +2 to a player's attribute this is a reference to role playing games in which it is common to find items that are able to improve one's character by increasing desirable attributes  in this case however +2 to cancer risk a consequence of the dagger's radioactivity would definitely not be considered a desirable attribute to increase in the title text the salesman tries to sell cueball another meteoric blade this one made from a carbonaceous chondrite carbonaceous chondrites are rocky meteors that generally don't contain a lot of metallic iron the salesman is either stating that the blade is simply a bunch of nonferrous meteor fragments glued together in the shape of a sword or stating that the iron he got out of the meteor is so full of impurities that it may as well be gravel however because it's made of extraterrestrial material he seems confident he'll still be able to sell it on novelty value alone
