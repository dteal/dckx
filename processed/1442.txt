n the idea of typographic chemistry presented in this comic is a play on  douglas hofstadterxe2x80x99s typographical number theory and typographical genetics which are featured in gxc3xb6del escher bach while hofstadter's typographical systems are designed to model aspects of real genetics and number theory randall abuses this notion by inventing a typographical system which bears no resemblance to real chemistry chemical bonding is a well known subject which explains the formation of molecules from atoms this comic refers to three chemical elements carbon c hydrogen h and oxygen o in real chemistry the formation of bonds between atoms depends on the number of valence electrons each atom has and how accessible those electrons are for bonding the comic jokingly replaces valence electron theory with a theory that the number of bonds an atom can form depends on the number of leaf vertices possessed by the chemical symbol's letter a leaf vertex is a vertex having only one edge connecting to one other vertex h for example the chemical symbol of hydrogen has 4 leaf vertices this is shown in the comic by the four half circles placed at each leaf vertex of the h thus in the comic's theory elemental hydrogen can form 4 bonds oxygen however having the chemical symbol o has no leaf vertices and according to the comic's theory should not bond to anything and is therefore inert of course the theory is completely inconsistent with observed chemistry while the comic declares oxygen is inert and forms no bonds this is not really the case the two unpaired valence electrons in a lone oxygen atom makes oxygen reactive and oxygen readily form molecules diatomic oxygen o2 makes up about 209% of earth's atmosphere and is essential for aerobic life including human life similarly a water molecule consists of an oxygen atom tightly bonded to two hydrogen atoms by observing real chemical compounds chemists have deduced that hydrogen atoms really have 1 valence electron carbon 4 and oxygen 6 allowing hydrogen to have up to 1 bond carbon up to 4 and oxygen up to 2 thus carbon can have up to four bonds and really is often found in crystalline form in nature diamonds and coal are allotropes of carbon; oxygen can have up to 2 bonds and can combine with carbon to form co2 instead of c2h in the comic randall thus gives to typographic hydrogen qualities that belong in real life to carbon since typographic hydrogen can have 4 bonds similarly typographic carbon is ascribed properties belonging to real life oxygen typographic oxygen takes on the properties of the real life noble gases like helium neon and argon which form no bonds and are inert while the ethynyl radical which has the structure xe2x88x99cxe2x89xa1c h does have the formula c2h there is no molecule with the c h c structure in nature the word mydrane is a whimsical neologism for this fictional substance the hydr  prefix for hydrogen is changed to mydr  a prefix which does not exist and combined to theane suffix for alkanes simple hydrocarbon molecules perhaps randall named this compound mydrane to declare ownership of it my  as in mine another reasonable assumption is that the word is a portmanteau of methyl me  is the prefix for 1 carbon chains attached to a functional group and hydrogen with theane suffix for alkanes; the nomenclature stems from di methyl hydrogenane which would form mydrane technically the nomenclature would be dimethyl since there are two methyl groups attached to the functional group ie hydrogen in this case it would however not be uncommon to drop a di  from a compound name if it's redundant only one possible compound eg dimethyl ether which sometimes is referred to as methyl ether or makes a clumsy name dimydrane could make it sound as if there are two mydrane groups the title text points out that the theory as presented only applies to sans serif text a serif is a small line across the end of each stroke
