n this comic features the starfield screensaver a popular windows screensaver of the 1990s which presents a moving starfield like what would be seen by an observer moving past stars at superluminal speeds see a video example this illusion is generally created by drawing white dots on the computer screen and then moving these dots outwards towards the edge of the screen before disappearing some of the stars appear to pass closer to the viewing point than others resulting in movements of visually greater speeds and more excitement; one can also fixate the center of the screen hoping to see the appearance of a star as close as possible to it which would later on pass very close to the viewpoint this comic extends it to the situation where the observer actually collides with one of these stars something that never happens with screensavers of this type the signal lost error message appears because the source of the signal is no longer transmitting since it was destroyed by colliding with said star the duck hunt gun is a reference to the nes zapper used with the nintendo entertainment system game duck hunt originally published in 1984 the user would point the zapper at the connected television screen while playing duck hunt and the nes would recognize whether or not the zapper was pointed at an appropriate target or not flying toasters is another old screensaver in the after dark package made for computers but not for the nes in the title text randall states that he is trying to use the nes zapper to shoot down flying toasters however the flying toaster screensaver and the nes zapper are two separate things that were never meant to be used together so the flying toasters will never react to being shot at by the nes zapper
