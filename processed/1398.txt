n the comic lists a few 'factoids' about snakes ranging from the mildly informative to the strictly tongue in cheek the first factoid references the hypothesis that snake venom was an evolutionary development of saliva that over time gradually became more toxic as snakes with saliva that was able to assist in subduing their prey possessed an evolutionary advantage it then posits that the evolutionary branch that developed into venomous snakes began with a snake whose mutation gave him a mouth that was 'slightly more gross than usual' additionally the comic illustration accompanying the second factoid colors in a 'habitat range' on a map of south america that is snake shaped implying that when it states 'the longest snake is found in brazil peru and chile' that this snake is so long that it literally stretches from brazil across part of peru into chile and that the 'habitat' shaded on the map is in fact this mammoth snake's silhouette the age length and location of the snake are so exaggerated that they are obviously untrue but may be a reference to the green anaconda one of the world's largest snakes which inhabits this region the final factoid is entirely tongue in cheek many factoids come in the form if you laid all the x end to end y would occur eg if you laid all the veins and arteries in the human body end to end they would stretch 60000 miles the y portion of the factoid is supposed to be surprising; therefore it is ironic that the factoid in the comic if you laid all the bones in a snake end to end you would have a snake is obvious and not at all exciting clearly you would not have an entire snake literally but you would have a skeleton that was recognizably that of a snake and could reasonably be referred to as 'a snake' the title text presents the amusing idea that 'snakes' as we know them are not in fact a suborder of reptiles but are instead human digestive tracts that rather than being a system of organs are creatures capable of escaping from their 'host' human and living independently the idea seems to follow from the superficial resemblance between snakes and the human digestive tract as long roughly tubular collections of animal matter which can process the food entering the top end and get rid of the waste through the other end randall had previously posted an incorrect map that included the snake's habitat in bolivia instead of peru
