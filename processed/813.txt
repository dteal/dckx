n in this comic randall presents a series of phrases ordered by how likely they are to be used as a one liner by a character in an action movie one liners are short punchy phrases typically witty or funny and are routinely used in films by the antagonist to taunt the protagonist or vice versa the perfect one liner leaves the recipient at a loss for a comeback and should make sense immediately if the phrase doesn't make sense or has to be explained the effect is lost while the phrases shown start off adhering to the witty and punchy stereotype of the one liner they quickly become absurb and non sensical      panel no   phrase   explanation    1   you're going down the memory hole now asshole  the memory hole is a mechanism for redacting documents photographs etc and a reference to george orwell's novel nineteen eighty four in this instance it implies that the character on the floor is about to be 'erased' from existence    2   hey you forgot to carry the two  cueball who appears to be at an advantage since he has a gun and his opponent only has a knife is pointing out an arithmetic error in his opponent's calculations this may simply be cueball adding insult to injury i'm about to shoot you but first i'm going to point out that you suck at math alternatively it could be a ruse to distract the knife wielding opponent or a case of well timed nerd sniping    3   looks like the fed just lowered the interest rate   the federal reserve system usually referred to as the fed is the central banking system in the united states while interest rates are usually lowered during a recession or a crisis this phrase appears to be completely out of context and lacks any humor    4   guess you should've scrolled all the way to the bottom before clicking agree   a common feature encountered when registering for user accounts or installing software is a very lengthy terms of service document describing the things you agree to abide by the vast majority of people simply click agree without reading the document essentially agreeing to anything and everything that the author decided to include which sometimes leads to things like giving your immortal soul to a company in the context of this panel perhaps the user agreed to be executed at random    5   bangarang motherfucker   this phrase is very similar to the line yippee ki yay motherfucker used by john mcclane in the die hard series bangarang is among other things the jamaican word for uproar it was popularized without the addition of 'motherfucker' as the cheer of the lost boys in the film hook  the title text is another suggested one liner phrase referring to an update reminder that frequently pops up when one attempts to view adobe flash content on a webpage after delivering the line the character triggers a detonator double colons are sometimes used in text to denote an action presumably setting off an explosive of some kind   the sentence doesn't make much sense and is too convoluted and wordy for an effective one liner which suggests that this is a continuation of the scale towards 'less likely' this phrase also proves that simply adding bitch asshole motherfucker or similar to the end of a phrase does not necessarily turn it into a great one liner
