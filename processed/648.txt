n cueball and megan have driven some distance from home and megan enjoys the pastime of leaf peeping happily taking photographs of the beautiful fall or autumn foliage cueball points out that they could've stayed home and used photoshop to alter pictures they've already taken saving themselves the trouble of going on the trip the hue control in such image editing programs shifts the colors around the spectrum without altering the brightness; the green leaves in a summer picture could then easily be shifted to yellow or red meanwhile a blue sky would become green or yellow though  megan simply shushes him in the strip but the title text is implied to be megan's retort saying that cueball used to be a happier person and if he will continue being like this she would prefer to see him in old pictures rather than living with him the comic is also showing how because of technology many people are not as happy as they once were instead of appreciating natural beauty cueball simply wishes to replicate the experience by using photoshop; unfortunately this would deprive him of both the experience of beautiful fall leaves and a shared intimacy with megan see also 1314 photos about people taking pictures and white hat complaining
