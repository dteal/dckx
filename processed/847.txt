n       this explanation may be incomplete or incorrect more on the lotr quote and sam's experience to compare to what cueball faced in his youth not enough to just tie it in in the title text explanationif you can address this issue please edit the page thanks  the stingray nebula in the constellation ara is the youngest known planetary nebula in the galaxy it was formed by an asymptotic giant branch agb b1 supergiant which blasted out the gas while becoming a white dwarf in 1987 well it happened about 18000 years ago but the light of the incident reached the earth in 1987 this comic went from a reassuring comic about stars at night giving hope in the darkness but then as with most xkcd's it took a turn  in this case the twist is that because cueball's star he got attached to exploded into a nebula we should only become attached to stars that aren't quite as volatile as the one that formed the stingray nebula the title text ties into the tolkien quote exc3xa4rendil with a silmaril strapped to his forehead is the tolkeinian myth explanation for the planet venus which has historically been mistaken for a star due to its brightness being known as the morning star or evening star venus will eventually in billions of years time be engulfed by the sun's expansion into a red giant the source of sam's comfort is also temporary in the long term
