n on april 20 1979 us president jimmy carter was allegedly attacked by a giant swimming rabbit while solo fishing on a boat in his hometown the reality is a little more nuanced according to carter the rabbit had actually been chased into the water by some hounds and swam near his boat carter splashed some water on it to compel the rabbit not to come any closer nevertheless the newspapers ate it up reveling in the ridiculous notion that anyone would feel threatened by a rabbit considered to be a small harmless herbivore with respected paper the washington post putting the story president attacked by rabbit on the front page since the white house refused to release the photograph the paper created a cartoon parody of the rabbit calling it paws in reference to the blockbuster film jaws about a killer shark carter's opponents used it as fodder for their arguments that carter's presidency was weak and ineffectual and basically the whole thing was blown way out of proportion by the american media as so often happens with goofy events such as this this comic treats the killer rabbit attack as a dark day for the united states and uses the phrase america must never forget which usually applies to days like the pearl harbor attack or 9/11  it essentially shows that for the entire history of the united states which starts with the signing of the declaration of independence it is the only event worth remembering the rabbit incident is also referenced in 1688 map age guide the title text is an assumption that the event has not been remembered in the way the comic jokes that it should have been and as a result younger readers will think he is kidding when he says carter was attacked by a rabbit
