n signs like this normally show the distance to places on earth's surface this sign also has an arrow pointing away from earth and towards space with a distance of 62&#160;miles 100&#160;km due to astronaut vandalism we think of space as being so very far away this comic puts into perspective that it's really a lot closer to get to space than to many destinations we're used to getting to by car or airplane we think of 62&#160;miles as being an easy trip on the ground but that same 62&#160;miles is incredibly hard when going vertically against the force of gravity distance wise however it's the same the title text states that the distance to space was changed later from 62&#160;miles 100&#160;km to 50&#160;miles 80&#160;km by retired air force pilots this indicates that the pilots wanted to reduce the altitude considered to be space so that their own high altitude flights could be considered space flights the usaf and other military branches will award astronaut wings to rated astronauts who fly higher than 100&#160;kilometers 62&#160;miles the 100 kilometer barrier known as the kxc3xa1rmxc3xa1n line was designated as the official boundary between the earth's atmosphere and outer space by the fxc3xa9dxc3xa9ration axc3xa9ronautique internationale fai in the mid 1950s notwithstanding this definition some test pilots in the 1960s received astronaut wings by the usaf for their greater than 50&#160;mi 805&#160;kilometers flights on the x 15 this comic thus both points out that the limit where space starts is arbitrarily chosen and also that space is often much closer than for instance the two largest cities in some randomly chosen location in the us one possible location is grenada ms which is about 100&#160;miles from memphis tn and about 114&#160;miles from jackson ms conversely it could mean jackson tn in which case tupelo ms or kenneth mo are both viable cities where the post is located
