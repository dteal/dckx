n the comic is a map showing examples of geographical features as they would be presented in a geography textbook may be based on the first page of the book you choose which displays a map of locations similar in style to the one used in the comic and asks the reader if you could go anywhere where would you go randall notes that he would like to live in the middle of this region these maps include an unusual density of different land forms leading to an interesting environment in which to live in the real world these geographical features might take up far more space and the geologic forces that shape them might create far different patterns than those shown this kind of neverland of geographical feature would offer a range of outdoor activities and landscapes that would make it a very nice place to live as long as the volcano does not erupt some of the geographic features do have a very loose similarity to the area around boston where randall lives also near boston is one geographical feature that randall has included in this map but has refrained from labeling the isthmus between the peninsula and the forest on the other hand the map actually looks quite a bit like the area around southwestern washington and northwestern oregon with the reader facing south so the high desert is on the upper left the volcano could be rainier or st helens real world outdoor enthusiasts do indeed appreciate the neverlandish landscape having little spanish influence locals would refer to a mesa as a butte the title text discusses a different type of diagram usually found in geography textbooks the one showing the mechanism of tornado formation randall notes that he would least like to live in the farm typically depicted in the background of such diagrams this is likely because the farm is depicted as being on a vast featureless stretch of flat prairie the opposite of the rich landscape in the comic the monotonous landscape would reflect that of tornado alley an area of the central united states where a large number of tornadoes form and which makes up a large portion of the great plains his dislike for this type of area may also simply be due to the damage created when a tornado hits that said chances of a direct tornado hit on any given house are slim compared to simply the risk of property damage living near an active volcano may be much more dangerous than living in tornado alley
