n no pun intended is an idiom meaning that something just said wasn't meant to be a pun implying that the preceding statement could be interpreted as one as done in the comic following a non pun with no pun intended although factually accurate breaks this implication and confuses listeners who will be trying to work out which part of the sentence could have been interpreted as a pun in this comic which is part of the my hobby series cueball uses this tactic to confuse beret guy who spends the next three hours trying to understand what pun there could have been in cueballs sentence i think he's internalized his girlfriend's attitudesthe guy cueball talks about seems to have taken over internalized all his girlfriends attitudes values standards and opinions putting these instead of those he has from his own identity or sense of self this is probably sad but there is no pun in the sentence beret guy however has been fooled by the addition of no pun intended and tries to overanalyze the sentence did cueball mean lied when saying internalized or was it analyzed or even attitudes he meant; could that be the pun since there was no pun he will never find a solution this was cueball's plan all along  it seems like beret guy after three hours finally gives up when he says dammit this then leads to the title text joke unfortunately for the hobbyist blank puns default to sexual innuendos the most notorious example being if you know what i mean the title text elicits a similar confused reaction as the most literate people will be more likely to want to spell out damn it rather than using the also correct abbreviated form with morphed spelling dammit what is referred to with two m's is because many people mainly in the us it seems contract damn it to damnit which is the wrong way
