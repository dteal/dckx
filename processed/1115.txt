n this comic is about the fact that much of the way we see the world is subjective from space the directions up and down appear subjective as gravity can not be strongly felt also since the vestibular system the balance glands in the ear does not strongly impact equilibrioception the sense of balance and the sense of balances is often based on vision which uses subjective clues to determine what is the up and down up and down can seem arbitrary at times for example people can convince them selves accidentally or deliberately that up is down and down is up or be confused about their orientation dizzy forcing yourself to think in a different perspective changes a lot of things that are usually thought of as mundanities beret guy convinces himself that down is toward the sky megan witnesses and asks him why he is clinging to the ground he responds that he is holding on to the ground so that he does not fall into the sky megan at first dismisses this but later looks up gets scared and is found by ponytail clinging to a mailbox afraid of falling up the title text continues this idea where  megan drops a bird into the sky and never hears it hit the bottom as birds can fly and captured birds often fly away when released its flight appeared to megan as the bird falling upward didn't hear it hit bottom would normally mean that after you throw a rock into a pit it takes too long to hit bottom or the sound couldn't even make it to the thrower
