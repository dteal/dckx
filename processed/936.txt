n this comic is saying that the password in the top frames tr0ub4dor&amp;3 is easier for password cracking software to guess because it has less entropy than correcthorsebatterystaple and also more difficult for a human to remember leading to insecure practices like writing the password down on a post it attached to the monitor in simple cases the entropy of a password is calculated as a^b where a is the number of allowed symbols and b is its length a dictionary word however long has an entropy of around 65000 ie 16 bits a truly random string of length 11 not like tr0ub4dor&amp;3 but more like j4i/tyj&amp;acy has 94^11 = 721 bits however the comic shows that tr0ub4dor&amp;3 has only 28 bits of entropy another way of selecting a password is to have 2048 symbols common words and select only 4 of those symbols 2048^4 = 44 bits much better than 28 it is absolutely true that people make passwords hard to remember because they think they are safer and it is certainly true that length all other things being equal tends to make for very strong passwords and this can confirmed by using rumkincom's password strength checker even if the individual characters are all limited to a z the exponent implied in we added another lowercase character so multiply by 26 again tends to dominate the results in addition to being easier to remember long strings of lowercase characters are also easier to type on smartphones and soft keyboards xkcd's password generation scheme requires the user to have a list of 2048 common words log22048 = 11 for any attack we must assume that the attacker knows our password generation algorithm but not the exact password in this case the attacker knows the 2048 words and knows that we selected 4 words but not which words the number of combinations of 4 words from this list of words is 2114 = 244 bits for comparison the entropy offered by diceware's 7776 word list is 13 bits per word if the attacker doesn't know the algorithm used and only knows that lowercase letters are selected the common words password would take even longer to crack than depicted 25 random lowercase characters would have 117 bits of entropy vs 44 bits for the common words list  example  below there is a detailed example which shows how different rules of complexity work to generate a password with supposed 44 bits of entropy the examples of expected passwords were generated in randomorg* if n is the number of symbols and l is the length of the password then l = 44 / log2n    symbols  number of symbols  minimum length  examples of expected passwords  example of an actual password  actual bits of entropy  comment   a 26 93 mdniclapwz jxtvesveiv troubadorx 16+47 = 207 extra letter to meet length requirement; log226 = 47   a 9  36  85  qih7cbrmd  ewpltiayq  tr0ub4d0r 16+3=19 3 = common substitutions in the comic   troubador1 16+33=193 log210 = 33   a a 52 77 jawwbyne netvgcrq troubador 16+1=17 1 = caps in the comic   a &amp; 58 75 jhnv c/~/fg troubador&amp; 16+4=20 4 = punctuation in the comic   a a 9 62 73 cde8cgaf ronyglmi tr0ub4d0r 16+1+3=20 1 = caps; 3 = common substitutions   a 9 &amp; 68 72 _@~#^2 un$l&#x7c;f tr0ub4d0r&amp; 16+3+4=23 3 = common substitutions; 4 = punctuation   a a 9 &amp; 94 67 re aro ^$rv3 tr0ub4d0r&amp; 16+1+3+4=24 1 = caps; 3 = common substitutions; 4 = punctuation   common words  2048  4  reasonable&#8203;retail&#8203;sometimes&#8203;possibly  constant&#8203;yield&#8203;specify&#8203;priority reasonable&#8203;retail&#8203;sometimes&#8203;possibly 11&#215;4=44 go to randomorg and select 4 random integers between 1 and 2048; then go to your list of common words   correct&#8203;horse&#8203;battery&#8203;staple  0  because of this comic this password has no entropy  a = lowercase letters a = uppercase letters 9 = digits &amp; = the 32 special characters in an american keyboard; randall assumes only the 16 most common characters are used in practice 4 bits  *&#160;the use of randomorg explains why jawwbyne has two consecutive w's why re aro has two r's why _@~#^2 has no letters why ewpltiayq has no numbers why constant yield is part of a password etc a human would have attempted at passwords that looked random
