n white hat tries to make normal conversation with cueball about yesterday's american football game super bowl 50 when asking cueball if he watched the game cueball begins with a simple yes but then continues to add the contextual fact that about a third of the us population watched the event which is an incredibly high percentage in today's media landscape and according to cueball this fraction is increasing despite media fragmentation thus even though there are today more and more different ways to watch news sports and other entertainment the super bowl continues to gain more viewers every year it turns out that cueball has a problem he cannot just reply to a simple question without trying to put the conversation into some kind of context which does not necessarily have anything to do with the question asked or at least not with the expected answer from white hat's reply it is obvious that he has had conversations like this with cueball before as he asks if they could just talk without your weird need to give context for everything cueball feels the need to disseminate any information he finds interesting even in trivial conversation normally people like to have context free conversations and white hat invites cueball to try to fit in with normal people's conversational style cueball apologizes and agrees to try but even though he really tries hard with his fists clenched and white hat encouraging him to just reply normally to a question about the rumored retirement of peyton manning he cannot stop himself from including context in his reply again white hat probably wanted cueball to join in such minimal context speculation but failing miserably again white hat finally gives up and suggests they should try another conversation in a year when cueball might have learned to talk about the super bowl without context hence the title this time he goes off on a tangent about peyton as a mammal and then adding the process of aging and mentioning two reasons for this which are not well understood the first he mentions is accumulation of damage which includes mutations that can lead to diseases such as cancer the other process he mentions is timed factors which includes telomeres these have been linked to biological aging because of the shortening of telomeres at each cell division; when telomeres become too short the cells die and so do mammals to cap it off he mentions that retiring is a recent concept but this only makes sense when compared to how long there have been mammals not compared to how long there have been sports and games where people could be too old and thus need to retire long before they would die from old age before humans began to enjoy things for fun the concept of retiring made no sense you worked/fought for a living until you got too old and died cueball in this comic may represent randall as much of xkcd  is spawned from or occasionally poking fun at his own hyper analytical tendencies and it is also common knowledge that randall is not very interested in sport though there are several xkcd comics about american football the year before this one he made another comic in relation to the final and in this comic 1480 super bowl he even mentions the fact that he does not know much about sports in general so this is the second year in a row a comic has been released in conjunction with the super bowl final but before 2015 there has only been one other comic like this which was in 2006 with 60 super bowl the title text continues the joke with cueball replying to the old anti humor joke why did the chicken cross the road cueball replies with a preposterous amount of information instead of the cliched simplistic answer to get to the other side cueball begins with the origin of chickens they are believed to be descendants from domestication of the red junglefowl which occurred at least five thousand years ago in asia as cueball correctly explains before there were chickens there could not be one crossing a road it also couldn't be called crossing the road without a pavement the first development of paved roads was in the city of ur in the ancient sumerian civilization about 4000 bc 6000 years ago also partly explained in cueball's reply as a trivial note this comic is a rare instance of white hat not being the fall guy for the joke but already in his next discussion with cueball 1657 insanity he was again the butt of the joke
