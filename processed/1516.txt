n in the pokxc3xa9mon franchise human characters called trainers capture fantastical creatures from the wild the titular pokxc3xa9mon a shortened form of pocket monsters and train them to battle one another pokxc3xa9mon are captured and stored in devices called pokxc3xa9 balls which shrink the creatures down to pocket size hence pocket monsters the anime's english dub has enshrined the phrase &lt;pokxc3xa9mon's name&gt; i choose you into popular culture memory when trainers do battle they often shout this phrase while throwing the ball to the ground releasing the pokxc3xa9mon at full size in this comic a pokxc3xa9mon chosen at some point was a pikachu the poster child for pokxc3xa9mon and the most publicly known type which does not intend to engage in the battle himself instead the pikachu chooses another pikachu to fight for him this process then repeats itself behind the pikachu with the pokxc3xa9ball is a long line of other pikachu suggesting that this process has been going on for a while nearby stands cueball holding a closed pokxc3xa9ball and megan looking at her watch this suggests that cueball intends to have his own pokxc3xa9mon fight the pikachu but is waiting to see which enemy his pokxc3xa9mon must face before the battle can actually begin waiting in vain if the above described process repeats indefinitely while megan is growing impatient with the delay given that cueball is holding a closed pokxc3xa9ball he has not deployed yet megan cannot herself be his pokxc3xa9mon she could be his opponent or a spectator the joke in this comic comes from analogy with the mathematical proof by induction which is a proof about a base case followed by a never ending sequence of steps each step leading to the next induction proves an assertion is true for one case and then infers that it must also be true for all related cases the title suggests that the process of pikachu choosing pikachu will never end effectively postponing the battle indefinitely but the title is win by induction by which randall implies that we have been given enough information to reason logically whether megan or cueball will win we have here turned mathematical induction on its head part of the humour in the comic is that the logic of induction doesn't work in reverse we cannot reason about an initial case by inferring something from a related case whose proof is dependent on knowledge about the initial case or perhaps the win referred to is precisely that the battle is indefinitely postponed the name induction comes from logic and discrete mathematics and is thus unrelated to the physical phenomena of electromagnetic induction; but the fact that pikachu is an electric type pokxc3xa9mon could be a word play connecting the two ideas if there were always only a single pikachu in each pokxc3xa9ball this would spawn an unlimited number of pikachu growing at a constant rate since as the title text notes there are occasionally two of them in a pokxc3xa9ball this would lead to exponential growth assuming each of the spawned pikachu in this case is bearing a pokxc3xa9ball pikachu was used in one of the storylines of 1350 lorenz see all the attack moves it made here
