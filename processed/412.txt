n black hat the cool headed troll has the tables turned on him almost always seen antagonizing other characters this comic shows him in a rare moment of losing face megan notices black hat facing away from cueball and her and decides to play a simple childish prank on him sneaking up from behind and shouting boo she succeeds in startling black hat most likely out of humiliation he hides himself completely in his hat for a moment it looks like black hat has disappeared altogether but then his hat inches away showing that he's still underneath it is possible that he was set on edge by danish as the period from journals 3 5 was clearly an emotional time for him both gags in this comic work by playing on our expectations the first is an unexpected moment of realism we are so used to seeing black hat cool and untroubled that we are surprised at the reminder that everyone's appearance is to some extent a facade black hat is still human the second gag on the other hand is the opposite we are so used to understanding the stick figures as representing humans that we're caught by surprise to see a literal interpretation of a stick figure with minimal volume folding up into a hat the title text is only  like in 82 frame or 455 hats it's a somewhat surreal comic and any further commentary might have detrimentally brought it down to earth which could also be said of these two other comics the comic hats is related to this one as it is also about black hats and how the usually all powerful black hat becomes the smaller one there not in size but in tallness of hat towers
