n thirty days hath september is a mnemonic frequently used to remember how many days each month has in the gregorian calendar cueball is reciting the mnemonic trying to figure out how many days october has this comic was released during the last week of october the 26th where it becomes increasingly important to know if there are 30 or 31 days in the month however he seems unable to concentrate on reciting the poem correctly keeping track of which months the poem has named and keeping in mind the specific month he was interested in so by the time he finishes the poem he is unsure whether october was in the list of 30 day months or not so he starts over again with the same result every single time as can be seen from the caption below the frame it seems he also get stuck in all the other months disregarding if it is one of the month mentioned in the mnemonic there are numerous versions of the mnemonic some of which rhyme better but this version is one of the more common ones in the caption randall states that this happens to him every month it's assumed that after a number of iterations with the poem he eventually remembers the months correctly and figures out the number of days in the current month which he then remembers until the month changes and forces him to resort to the mnemonic again the title text is a parody of life hacking and suggests just looking up on one's computer's calendar how many days there are in each month with the punchline disguised by over explaining the process of the cool mental calculation hack even though there's nothing even remotely resembling a mental calculation in checking a calendar alongside the comic the joke is that the mnemonic is supposed to be the real cool mental calculation hack which supposedly saves a lot of effort this is similar to 1567 kitchen tips there is also a joke that he is unsure if there are 31 days in october although halloween is a largely celebrated holiday on the 31st
