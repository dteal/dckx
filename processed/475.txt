n this comic is a sequel of sorts to 445 i am not good with boomerangs as it deals with the same subject manner with the same panel layout the first strip shows cueball throwing a boomerang which doesn't come back in 939 arrow a boomerang returns to cueball which can either be the same cueball from this comic or another person  in the second strip he throws another boomerang which somehow manage to hurt the ozone layer as indicated by an off screen voice this is of course not possible with a boomerang&#91;citation needed&#93; as it is a layer of ozone molecules very high up in the atmosphere the third strip shows cueball throwing something that appears to be a boomerang but then megan enters and reveals that it was their last banana which she probably had expected to eat since she calls him an asshole the final strip shows cueball throwing one last boomerang which breaks the frame of the comic already after two out of the four frames used in each of the first three strips then panning down we find the last panel much larger and suddenly mainly black instead of white it shows that this time he was actually inside a spacecraft which resembles an apollo lunar module in a very bad manner and the boomerang has just broken out through the hull we see the boomerang and cueball tumbling out into space with the escaping air to certain death the title text notes that assuming a theory that is no longer generally accepted where the universe has a positive closed curvature and lots of mass the boomerang would after a very long time hit cueball in the back of his head this would happen because under those conditions the entire universe would eventually fall back on itself in the big crunch before this happens everything would again get pressed close together and it is during this process that the boomerang would finally returns to his frozen but quite possibly preserved head so at least one success in four attempts boomerangs also became a main theme in the interactive comic 1350 lorenz the same format of multiple bad endings to the same starting set up is used in 1515 basketball earth
