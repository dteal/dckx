n the bdlpswdks effect in the title is an acronym for bernoulli doppler leidenfrost peltzman sapir whorf dunning kruger stroop effect as explained by ponytail in the comic she stands in front of a slide that shows cueball being subjected to this effect the effect mentioned appears to be a mashup of seven scientific principles with nine scientists' names included from physics and social sciences with elements from each principle appearing in the resulting description of the effect  bernoulli's principle in fluid dynamics also mentioned in 803 airfoil states that an increase in the speed of a fluid with certain properties occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy  this is referenced by the firetruck lifting off and hurtling  the doppler effect in physics refers to the change in a wave's frequency for an observer moving relative to its source sound from the oncoming firetruck increases in pitch this is referenced by cueball reacting faster if the shouting is in a non tonal language than a tonal language in tonal languages changes in pitch change the meaning thus tonal languages may suffer more from doppler distortion than non tonal ones additionally the choice of firetruck was likely influenced by this effect as a firetruck and its siren are often invoked as an example of it this may also be referenced by the fact that cueball reacts faster when red is shouted as the doppler effect makes light shift up the spectrum&#160; red may still be visible after the shift but green may be out of the visible range   the leidenfrost effect in physics refers to how liquid will produce an insulating vapor layer when in near contact with an extremely hot surface causing it to hover over said surface this is referenced by the firetruck lifting off on a layer of superheated gas  the peltzman effect in behavioral economics refers to how regulations intended to increase safety are ineffective or counterproductive because people feeling safer will engage in riskier behaviours this is referenced by the firefighter speeding due to the feeling of safety he/she has in a modern firetruck subsequently creating a hazardous situation and reducing the safety of the pedestrian  the sapirxe2x80x93whorf hypothesis in linguistics states that a person's world view and cognitive processes are affected by the structure of the language the person speaks this is referenced by languages with a word for firefighter giving a quicker reaction if cueball speaks or is currently thinking in a language without a word for firefighter he might be slower to recognize the role and authority of the driver warning him and thus slower to react to the danger  the dunningxe2x80x93kruger effect in social psychology refers to unskilled people mistakenly perceiving themselves as more skilled than they really are while skilled people underestimate their own abilities this is referenced by the tonal language being a language cueball thinks he is fluent in but isn't  the stroop effect in psychology refers to the phenomenon in which it is easier to name the color of the ink in which a word is written when the word refers to the same color as the ink than when the word refers to a different color this is referenced by cueball diving out faster if the driver screams red than if the driver screams green as a traditional american firetruck is red and therefore it may create a moment of confusion for cueball if the driver shouts green it may also reference the common usage of red as indicating fire or danger while green indicates safety   this comic is probably a comment on the replication crisis in social psychology which has been in the news recently for example studies finding that merely thinking about intelligent people eg writing down the attributes of a professor will actually improve performance on math tests were once widely believed and this intelligence priming effect is even included in textbooks however recent attempts to reproduce these effects have mostly failed and this failure to replicate is true of many social priming effects as well as other experiments in social psychology randall is also mocking the complicated or even convoluted setups often used in these experiments usually for an effect to be considered real the scientific method requires the effect to be replicated by different experimenters in different times and places it is hard to imagine several scientists in different parts of the world creating the setup to replicate this effect; however the title text mentions maybe  sarcastically it has been done countless times many other xkcd strips have commented on the ease with which surprising and novel but false results can be published in the scientific literature such as 1478 p values and 882 significant furthermore the opportunity of publishing this comic strip may or may not be related to the recently issued sequels of franchises such as `mad max` and `carmageddon` where it's not unusual to find heavy wheeled vehicles trampling pedestrians for fun or simply because the drivers do not care
