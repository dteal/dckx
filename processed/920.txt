n a youtube party is when a group of people show each other youtube videos the problem with youtube parties is that no one pays attention to the video that's playing; instead each person is thinking of the video that they personally want to play next you can see analogous behavior at any get together where couples parents are telling stories about their kids nobody cares about anybody else's kid; they are just waiting not even listening until they get the chance to talk about their own offspring the joke seems to be that everybody is doing this but it is unclear whether they realize it they each seem to be under the delusion that the others will be fascinated by their video or child's accomplishments even though the evidence strongly suggests otherwise possibly they don't care about that either; they just want an audience even an unwilling one this may be defensible where kids are involved because the parents could reasonably feel that the accomplishments of their children reflect well on themselves however the people in the youtube party didn't create the videos they just found them which makes their behavior or perhaps youtube parties in general even more inane and pointless the title text reiterates this point the speaker is reminded of another video that is so superior to the one currently playing that we should find it and watch it immediately we can always go back to the current video later if anybody still remembers that is; and according to the comic above no one will want to remember it
