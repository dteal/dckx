n this comic illustrates the problems of information explosion coupled with a dense web of hypertext links through most of human history written media has been both slow and linear hypertext allows a new type of information consumption through small chunks of information linked together in a web of related concepts and by being digital each new chunk can be retrieved quickly and effortlessly wikipedia applies this principle very strongly and because it covers so many topics it is common for a reader to skim an article about a topic they need or want to know about and end up following a series of links out of curiosity since each new page also has several links the overall navigation pattern resembles a tree that branches out exploding in size with each new level of link clicking thus resulting in many wasted hours over three in this case of reading stuff unrelated to the original goal and lots of open browser tabs holding a wide variety of articles which are seemingly unrelated but have common ancestors the problem for randall of wasting time on wikipedia was later referenced in the title text of 1501 mysteries and the more general problem of getting trapped following a never ending chain of interesting links was covered in 609 tab explosion the large diversity in end links may also be a reference to the wikipedia game one can also see this effect occur in other mediawiki powered wikis such as this very website where one comic can lead to another of similar relation or category in the table below a possible route for each entry has been found finding routes between the start and end points of the two pages above and the six below makes good challenges in the wikipedia game the title text refers to two of the articles that were supposedly reached at the bottom william howard taft was the 27th president of the us in office from 1909 to 1913 who was notorious for being so overweight that he became stuck in the white house bathtub a wet t shirt contest is an exhibitionistic competition typically featuring young women contestants at a nightclub bar or resort clearly the combination of these two would be rather bizarre there is an online game that involves trying to get from one wikipedia page to another in the shortest possible route http//thewikigamecom/
