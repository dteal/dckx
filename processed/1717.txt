n bee honey is a food item with natural antimicrobial properties  it can remain unspoiled for a person's entire lifetime making it practically nonperishable for ordinary consumers  it is frequently claimed that archaeologists have found jars of honey that have been well preserved for thousands of years in ancient tombs often those found in egyptian pyramids hence the title pyramid honey  the claims are generally assertions which may point to other similar assertions as supporting evidence but do not provide specific details such as the identity of the actual tombs where such jars have been found or the names of the archaeologists who have affirmed finding such jars  the commonality of the assertion however leads some people to claim that honey's shelf life is infinite which is a much stronger claim which would not be supported by the assertion even if it is shown to be factual in the comic cueball tells megan about an article in smithsonian magazine presumably this one that claims honey has an infinite shelf life  the article links to a book which makes the assertion of such findings but does not provide factual support of the findings  megan thinks the sources of the article are wrong and wants to refute it she tells cueball believe it or not which black hat hears and he immediately states that he believes her and is convinced without hearing any arguments from megan he then decides to begin a facebook page so he can tell the internet without giving megan a chance to explain any further a hill to die on is a phrase from ernest hemingway's 1940 novel for whom the bell tolls about an american who volunteers in the 1936 1939 spanish civil war to fight fascism who ends up wounded and alone about to ambush the enemy to give his comrades a chance to escape; a weird hill to die on would thus mean a weird cause if not a just one to fight for to the bitter end black hat asserts that he needs such a cause because the real weird hills are too far from his house humorously implying he would be equally satisfied with a literal weird hill black hat's actions are clearly premature since he has not heard any evidence to back up the claim and does not understand the nuances of megan's position cueball states that it could have gone better whereas megan seems to be resigned to it presumably the best black hat can do would be to parrot what he has heard from megan without any understanding or critical thinking on his part  due to his lack of understanding he may even interject his own ideas ones megan never believed nor stated into his posts  these are all consistent with him calling himself pyramid honey truther  the word truther refers to people who reject established facts and instead choose to believe in conspiracies like people who claim the moon landings never happened or believe the us government is behind the 9/11 attacks while a few conspiracy theories turn out to be true most are easily proved to be fake but this does not stop people from believing in them anyway just like the two mentioned here which are not easily dismissed by believers this turns megan who likely has a reasonable and well justified position unwillingly into the source of conspiracy theories alternatively he only does this to troll megan and cueball and everyone else that reads his facebook page just because he knows they will get annoyed and also to state that this is an unimportant subject a weird hill to fight for to make such a fuss over no one wish to eat that old honey anyway or wish to keep it for that long so he may see this as a completely uninteresting subject and thus makes fun of megan with his statements this would also be more in line with his usual behavior the title text refers to the eye of providence a symbol of an eye at the top of a pyramid found on us currency and often associated with conspiracy theories of the illuminati black hat again refers to the pyramid honey found under the pyramids and calls it a conspiracy that goes all the way to the top this usually means that the politicians or the government agencies ruling the country know about it but keep it a secret from the public but in this case he mixes up terms and says it goes to the top of the pyramid from the bottom to where the giant eye is as promised he also writes four words in all capital letters shouting out the truth this comic is likely a satire of the stereotypical internet mindset and plays up the frequent confusion between legitimate scientific scepticism where unsupported claims are rejected and conspiracy theory faux scepticism where legitimate evidence is rejected because it does not support a specific viewpoint
