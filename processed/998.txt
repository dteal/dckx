n this new year comic is in reference to the fact that the mayans an ancient civilization in the americas created a calendar that ends or more accurately restarts on december 21 2012 this date is regarded as the end date of a 5125 year long cycle in the calendar used by the mayan culture knowing this some thought that the world was going to end on that date consequently a lot of people were talking about the mayans concerned that the world might end after december 21 2012 passed uneventfully everyone was less concerned about the mayans because the world didn't end it is worthy of note that this comic was published nearly a year before the significant date and that randall predicted both the hype and the aftermath perfectly there is a measure of irony to be had in how the mayans who still exist today were largely ignored by the doomsayers or acknowledging that huge city building ancient american civilizations existed at all in the final frame megan parodies the phrase those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it applying a twist to suggest an academic context in most american schools a grade point average is computed by assigning numeric value to each letter grade a=4 b=3 c=2 d=1 and f=0; receiving high marks all a's thus yields a 40 gpa however if you fail to learn from history xe2x80x94 that is get a failing grade f and had at least 3 other classes not an unusual course load xe2x80x94 you would still get a 30 with a's in those other classes she is making the callous xe2x80x94 if roundabout xe2x80x94 observation that failing to grasp history while no doubt troubling isn't an academic show stopper perhaps explaining why so many americans are so bad at it her comment may also be taken to suggest that people who feared the mayan prediction of the end of the world would come to pass had failed to appropriately extrapolate from the numerous other faulty predictions of the end of the world in fact the mayans never actually predicted the end of the world with their calendar those who failed to learn from history jumped to conclusions yet again the title text jokes that to make up for the lack of mayan discussion randall plans to spend 2013 talking solely about mayans for obvious reasons people would probably get sick of this very quickly hence his comment that his relationships might not fare well thankfully as of 2014 not a single published xkcd comic of 2013 featured any mayans so we're pretty sure this promise wasn't kept two years later another new years comic with just the new years number as the title was released 1311 2014 but actually the content of that comic was more related to the previous comic before this one 997 wait wait which is also a new year comic that took a look at what could happen in 2012 just as 2014 does for 2014 in 2016 a comic with only the new year as the name theme occurred again 1624 2016 for some reason this only seems to happen in the even years
