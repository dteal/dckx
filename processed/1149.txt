n megan plays the part of dorothy the protagonist of the wizard of oz dorothy has been trapped in the land of oz due to extreme weather and must obtain transportation home an off screen character presumably the wizard of oz himself offers her a ride if she obtains the the wicked witch of the west's magic broom megan wears ruby slippers and uses them as a bargaining chip to obtain the witch's broom the little dog offered in the title text is dorothy's faithful companion toto the wicked witch of the west is a fictional character and the most significant antagonist in the wizard of oz which is based on l frank baum's children's book the wonderful wizard of oz in the 1939 version of the wizard of oz the wicked witch flies on her broom over the emerald city demanding dorothy's surrender and the wizard demands the destruction of the witch with her broom as proof in exchange for granting the wishes of dorothy and her companions the point of the comic is to show how easily dorothy could resolve the situation if she was willing to forsake both her traveling companions and her pet she leaves toto with the witch who will presumably do something unpleasant to him when she realizes that dorothy has stolen her broom she will also leave oz completely at the mercy of said witch by giving her the ruby slippers and leaving with the wizard it should be noted that this resolution defies the canon established in the movie as nobody could remove the slippers as long as dorothy lived presumably including dorothy herself 1
