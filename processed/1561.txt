n this is a modified version of the phase diagram for water a phase diagram is a chart that shows the states or phases that a substance will be in under various temperatures and pressures water's phases are particularly well studied; on the real phase diagram for water there are a great many phases listed most people are familiar with three phases of water xe2x80x94 solid ice liquid water and gas vapour xe2x80x94 and with the fact that an increase in temperature will cause water to change from one state to another the gas and liquid phases are quite straightforward; however there is in fact not one single solid phase of water but a variety of numbered phases ice i through ice xvi are currently recognized several of which are divided into sub categories ordinary everyday ice is known as ice ih ice one h most of the more unusual forms of ice only form under very high pressure randall's phase diagram starts out realistically though slightly simplified in several ways for one it simply uses the name ice for the usual forms it is focused in on a narrower area than the more complete diagram linked earlier; on that version the ice v region is quite small and ice iii is barely visible whereas both are quite plain to see on randall's diagram lastly where most phase diagrams have pressure increase upwards randall has the pressure scale increase downwards this has been chosen to make it possible for the jokes to appear at the bottom of the chart else the comic would not be funny for the average reader because as the diagram continues downwards and the pressure increases the jokes begin beyond the moderately high pressure forms of ice ice ii iii and v a real phase diagram has ice vi; randall has vanilla ice ice vi vanilla ice is the stage name of a white rap/hip hop artist from the 1990s; the initials of vanilla ice and the roman numeral six are both vi vanilla ice's biggest hit ice ice baby used samples from the earlier song under pressure by david bowie and queen; accordingly on randall's diagram the vanilla ice region transitions to david bowie &amp; queen when it is under even higher pressure further references to ice ice baby are found in the title text near the beginning of the song vanilla ice raps the line all right stop collaborate and listen the unusual choice of collaborate in this line has made it memorable and the word is used in the title text in a more typical context the phrase survive at room temperature for several months is likely a reference to ice ice baby being vanilla ice's only major hit humorously suggesting he faded out of the public view after a few months of fame finally even the word sample may be deliberately chosen as a reference to the sampling of under pressure ice ice baby was written in 1983 but in 1990 vanilla ice finally admitted that he used unmodified samples from under pressure and paid royalties to queen and bowie
