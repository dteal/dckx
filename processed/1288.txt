n there are now two sequels 1625 substitutions 2 and 1679 substitutions 3 but there have been several comics using substitutions both before and after these ones randall is playing off of the fact that many readers of modern news articles quickly become bored with the legal and political jargon he suggests that by substituting certain words for others can make reading the article more interesting albeit less accurate although since randall doesn't think very  highly of the news he's probably suggesting this chart wouldn't make them less accurate at all see for instance 558 1000 times and 932 cia for example a sentence that reads  witnesses reported that the suspect allegedly escaped unharmed  would be changed to  these dudes i know reported that the suspect kinda probably escaped unharmed  this substitution does not change the meaning much and the original sentence does not lose much of its accuracy however for substitutions later in the comic a sentence may be changed as following  a new study finds that senators and other congressional leaders are increasingly likely to view election results on their smartphone  into  a tumblr post finds that elf lords and other river spirits are increasingly likely to view eating contest results on their pokxc3xa9dex  which is less meaningful but more interesting the final substitution returns from the realm of the ridiculous to replacing could not be reached for comment with is guilty and everyone knows it if a journalist writes a story about an accused suspect but is unable to contact them or receives no response from them they will write that the person could not be reached for comment randall's whimsical assumption that silence implies guilt is so common that juries are instructed that they should not infer guilt if the defendant fails to testify particularly in nations which have a right against self incrimination chrome and firefox extensions are available for applying the substitutions on webpages 'spaaace' could be a reference to the space core from portal 2 or to the way the muppet show presented pigs in spaaace the virtual boy is a table top video game console made by nintendo released in 1995 and discontinued about the same year it achieved true 3d graphics through the use of a large visor containing a pair of led screens the pokxc3xa9dex is a device in the pokxc3xa9mon world that records the data of captured pokxc3xa9mon homestar runner is the title character of a flash animated web cartoon series known for being an idiot it seems generally that randall is no fan of google glass which was also shown earlier in 1251 anti glass and later in 1304 glass trolling thus explaining why google glass has such a ridiculous substitution as virtual boy google glass has become a recurring theme in xkcd in the title text elon musk is mentioned he is amongst other things the ceo of tesla motors which produces electric cars in the title text the sentence electric cars was replaced by atomic cats according to the chart of the comic news reports about new studies tumblr posts are further lampooned in 1295 new study a comic posted two weeks later
