n this comic centers around a joke about quantum entanglement in physics if you don't observe something it has all possible states not a specific one it is a double entendre with the word observe meaning both look at physics sense and celebrate a holiday one of the most famous examples on this is the schrxc3xb6dinger's cat paradox in this comic a jewish physicist does not know when christmas is being a physicist he believes that since he doesn't observe christmas it therefore has no definite date the title text refers to another principle in physics where the act of measuring something must also change it in some way  if one drops a thermometer into into a mug of water energy spent or released when heating or cooling the mercury in the thermometer changes the temperature of the water in the mug by a small amount  the only way not to interfere with the temperature of the water in the mug is not to measure it
