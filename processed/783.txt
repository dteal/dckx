n cueball wants to use his gps to find an individual's house and therefore needs the house's address the person on the phone is giving him directions something that is useless because by giving cueball the address the gps can give directions to the address possibly better than the ones he is getting over the phone cueball then decides to tell the person that he would like to mail something to their house hoping they will give him the address because you must have the address to mail something the title text is a continuation of the comic's joke by the end of the comic cueball has got the information he needs and has just ignored the directions he did not want however if the person on the phone insists on checking cueball has remembered the directions correctly cueball has to be able to learn the useless information he did not want in the first place and has been mostly ignoring at least well enough to repeat it once judging by the roads mentioned in the comic presumably i 495 and ma 18 the person on the phone lives somewhere around southern lakeville massachusetts and cueball is starting from the boston area
