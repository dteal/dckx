n a bromance is a modern slang term for a strong non romantic relationship between two males it is a portmanteau of the words brother meaning a close male friend aka bro and romance although current in popular media some commentators have criticized the implicit homophobia in the term suggesting that it denotes cultural discomfort at relationships of emotional closeness between men 1 in this comic randall is implying the wikipedia page for the word bromance should more accurately represent what most bromances actually are friendships this could be a joke to reference the fact that some males prefer to not call friendships as such for fear of looking unmasculine or being confused as a gay couple the comic makes light of the fact that the word bromance and friendship are interchangeable and should be treated as such the comic later contains parts of the edited article mocking the use of bromance in popular culture implying that friendships can be used just as easily to describe platonic male relationships despite supposedly vandalizing the bromance article the article is titled friendship giving a similar result to word replacement browser extensions as in 1031 s/keyboard/leopard/ it is also possible however that a displaytitlefriendship tag was added to the article's source code to cause the page's name to display as such the title text implies randall does not agree with wikipedia vandalism except in the case of bromance/friendship and also militia/fanclub possibly to make light of the harsh sounding word in a negative light in the wake of this comic several wikipedia pages were vandalized among them bromance militia organizations in the united states militia united states and friendship all these pages were semi protected by an administrator against further attempts for a week after this comic was published the day this comic was published a vote to delete the bromance article was initiated on wikipedia2 a later comic called 1746 making friends was also not so much about friendship but rather about vultures
