n this comic was posted on tuesday july 14 2015 in honor of the new horizons deep space probe making its flyby at pluto thus breaking the typical monday/wednesday/friday cycle for the xkcd comics also on this day he released the first what if in over three months and it was called new horizons luckily it did not end up back on earth as depicted in 1532 new horizons releases 1xc2xbd month before closest approach randall has taken one of the probes images of pluto and outlined humorous examples of pareidolia on top of it it can be compared to preliminary descriptions by geologists eg new horizons' best look at pluto before close approach|the planetary society the comic probably winks at percival lowell whose observatory photographed pluto in 1915 known as planet x unfortunately percival lowell is most famous for are his drawings of the canals on mars which are widely misunderstood as channels based on wrong translations from italian to other languages the title text refers to the debate as to whether pluto should be classified as a full or dwarf planet this debate was particularly brought into the public eye and came to be seen as a matter of controversy following the 2006 iau definition of planet the text may imagine that this debate winds on with definitions being created and revised until a ridiculous state is reached whereby pluto has a special class of celestial body named after it called a 'pluto' but fails to fulfill the arbitrary criteria set up for it and hence is called a 'dwarf pluto' there actually exist the terms plutoid and plutino that relate directly to groups that pluto belongs to but see those pages for details of their use and usage
