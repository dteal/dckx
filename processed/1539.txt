n big companies have always tried to get the greatest amount of information from their customers because that translates into more money earned however ability to gather store and process such information is limited by the technology available with the recent development of computers this ability has grown far more than anyone could have suspected just 20 years ago; to the point that companies like google or facebook get almost unimaginable amounts of data from their users; and this data is gathered and stored automatically and can be efficiently accessed this data is routinely used to for example tailor online ads to the browsing history of the user seeing the ad they could potentially be used for more evil purposes like selling the medical history of users to insurance companies many users don't feel that they're giving out so much information and in fact that few of them have given google or facebook their medical history however some leaks have proven quite the opposite in the aol leak referenced in 155 search history searches for how does a male's cocaine use affect a fetus hysterectomy or 8 alcohol drinks a day surely would be interesting for a medical insurance company to know in the comic ponytail is puzzled because people are not worried about google or facebook using their information in evil ways; however megan raises a quite fair point namely that the huge amount of nuclear weapons in existence is much scarier and that was worrying to the general public in the 1980s however people have grown tired of that and now concerns have moved to internet privacy only because it's new what is perceived as dangerous or worrying follows trends and fashions not directly related to real danger ie happen on auto pilot the point megan is making is that maybe it's better to just accept that things work in this way and go with the flow this is very similar to what happens in 1480 super bowl or 1534 beer in the title text we move ahead 10 years to a similar conversation where the two aspects of the above have been inexplicably mixed a future equivalent to ponytail asks why we all think it is ok to hand over the control of our nuclear weapons to google and facebook which would certainly be a nonsensical route to take this could also be seen as another step toward the singularity from which perspective handing over control of nuclear weapons could be desirable catastrophic implicit and/or unavoidable this comic was posted on the day after vladimir putin had announced that russia would add 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles to its nuclear stockpile this year within a year randall has made several other comics about nuclear weapons the first of these 1520 degree off came just 1xc2xbd month before this one later  these two comics were released early in 2016 1626 judgment day and 1655 doomsday clock nuclear weapons are also mentioned twice in thing explainer specifically they are explained in the explanation for machine for burning cities about thermonuclear bombs but they are also mentioned in boat that goes under the sea about a submarine that caries nukes all three comics and both explanations in the book does like this comic comment on how crazy it is that we have created enough firepower to obliterate earth several times or at least scourge it for any human life
