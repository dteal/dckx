n fps stands for first person shooter which is a type of video game like halo or duke nukem in which you are looking at the world from the first person perspective of the character you are controlling randall notes in the caption that no one liked his fps mod short for modification of the fps game and in the title text it is clear that cueball who played this modified version no longer enjoys the game fps games are controversial for their supposed quality of encouraging violence such as killing especially towards other human beings one point of the controversy is that while virtual enemies are just pixels on a screen real enemies have actual lives emotions and the like in the games there is a disconnect between the act and its emotional cost thus leading to the controversy that fps games encourage wanton killing or violence in general to solve problems instead of considering the other party randall makes reference to this by adding a mod that gives biographical snippets of the enemy you shoot in the game thus giving cueball the perspective of the enemy he just shot and causing emotional consequence and remorse by removing the disconnect between pixel and life the above can also be a reference towards making games more realistic giving the enemies a life above being mere targets definitely makes the game more realistic but such a game would not be that enjoyable this has been explored previously in 772 frogger the title text talks about how gender is portrayed in games for some people it is more emotionally affecting to kill a woman as women are considered biologically weaker than men by many societies and societal norms state that men must protect them gender equality is a highly debated topic with many different viewpoints where one's conscious reasoned views may sometimes stand at odds to subconscious feelings when a player becomes aware that killing women bothers one more than killing men it exposes an inconsistency in the player's own logic one that's very uncomfortable to confront in the 1993 post apocalyptic novel the fifth sacred thing the eco pacifist residents of san francisco defeat an invading army using a similar tactic rather than engage in armed defense the family and friends of each dead san franciscan speak directly to the soldiers who killed them saying my wife was the mother of five children and i loved her dearly or my cousin liked baseball eventually the soldiers suffer psychological breakdowns and defect en masse rather as cueball seems to do in the title text
