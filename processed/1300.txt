n megan has somehow acquired a set of galilean moons similar to the four primary moons of jupiter the positions of the moons in the successive panels are reminiscent of the observations made by galileo galilei in 1610 which proved for the first time that objects in the heavens could orbit something other than the earth today these observations can be reproduced on successive nights by anyone looking at jupiter with binoculars as each of megan's moons passes close to cueball it says something different io the innermost and second smallest always says hi europa the second innermost and smallest always uses the phrase what's your name ganymede the third moon from jupiter but the largest in size interrupts europa by shouting moooooon callisto the farthest from megan expresses its annoyance at the antics of the other three moons because the inner moons orbit jupiter faster due to kepler's third law they pass by cueball more often io ten times europa five times and ganymede twice over the course of the comic in fact the outermost crater scarred moon callisto appears to have passed its closest approach to cueball just before the first panel perhaps before megan and her retinue had walked up to cueball and does not approach cueball again until the tenth panel at that point due to some apparent exertion on callisto's part it leaves megan's orbit and begins to orbit cueball instead this process could be seen as analogous to the capture of moons from one planet to another which can happen in less stable systems than our solar system if two planets were to pass close to each other but is mostly just whimsical the humour derives from attributing human characteristics to the moon callisto in attempting to escape from the other three moons  filegalilean moon laplace resonance animationgif  the 124 orbital resonance of ganymede europa and io  the title text refers to the unusual orbital resonance among the three inner galilean moons io has an orbital period of about 178 earth days europa 355 days and ganymede 715 days putting them into a 124 resonance callisto with an orbital period of 1669 days is not part of the resonant system this is illustrated in the animated picture at right where you may notice that all conjunctions between io and europa take place at the 12 o'clock position and all conjunctions between europa and ganymede take place at 6 o'clock position you may also notice at the animated picture that unlike in the fifth and ninth panels of the comic the three moons are never on the same side of jupiter at the same time it is thought that this resonance came about as the moons migrated outward due to tidal acceleration; because the inner moons migrated more quickly first io caught up with the 21 resonance with europa and then the two of them evolved outward in lockstep until europa caught up with the 21 resonance with ganymede if the jupiter system were to continue its current evolutionary path for long enough several billion years ganymede would eventually catch up to the 21 resonance with callisto and callisto would also be trapped in the resonance becoming the fourth member of a 1248 system the title text expresses callisto's relief at escaping such a fate describing the relationship among the other three moons as their weird thing callisto also escapes a common practice among certain groups of humans in which the members greet each other with meaningless phrases usually an inside joke whenever they meet which could also be described as their weird thing the word orbit could finish callisto's sentence as it can also mean a sphere of influence or interest
