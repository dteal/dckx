n similar to the my hobby series this comic depicts one of randall's goals in life he wants to hire academy award winning actor jeremy irons to deliver all of randall's dialogue in life while randall perhaps lip syncs it he is apparently basing this desire on the fact that irons a classically trained english actor portrayed scar the main antagonist in the 1994 disney animated feature the lion king the line that is spoken in the comic is from the song be prepared which scar sings in the film thus it's not entirely clear whether randall enjoys irons's deep rumbling british accented voice or whether it's scar's dialogue in the film that randall truly would like to be speaking the title text suggests that randall knows the dialogue of the lion king from memory; it also suggests there are others he knows as well he is around the appropriate age to have been in the target market for the film he would have been around 10 at the time and probably saw it many times
