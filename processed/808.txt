n the image shows fields of human life that would be greatly improved and/or allowed a certain people to make a lot of money if some weird phenomena things mostly paranormal actually worked in reality or were testable and usable concepts weird phenomena in this case means counter intuitive things that usually go against common sense and which the science hasn't investigated to the full yet or didn't find any evidence of in the first place making claims completely unscientific as the comic tries to prove if there were commercial use for it and proofs of it working there will be high investment made in the technology to use and harness such concepts so far only relativity and quantum electrodynamics have found some use in the real world because they are scientific concepts as compared to all the other ones specifically the theory of relativity allows your global positioning system gps device to synchronize with satellites a hundred miles in the air and show your current position the design of modern circuit boards and other electronic devices is influenced by quantum electrodynamics xe2x80x94 smartphones or high capacity hard drives wouldn't be possible without that theory the non scientific disproved concepts trying to pass as real and scientific are as follows  remote viewing alleged ability to see and know things far away with the strength of your mind without physically being in that place and using technology cameras tv screens and so on dowsing alleged supernatural ability to sense using two dowsing rods/sticks/pieces of metal where hidden valuables or underground water/oil supplies are both dowsing and remote viewing would have greatly cut costs to oil companies because it would have made finding new oil sources easier   auras non scientific belief that every human has invisible energy field that can affect their health and feelings homeopathy non scientific belief that the more diluted a remedy the more effective it is and that the remedy should before dilution cause similar symptoms to the disease it is said to cure these remedies are often diluted so much that on average not even a single molecule of the original substance will remain it is completely untrue and proven no more effective than a placebo so one can instead use much cheaper glucose and have the same effect it is often advertised as an alternative medicine which means it is not a medicine at all remote prayer non scientific belief trying to help a person with their health problems by praying/pleading to a greater supernatural force to help them get better while we're not ones to rag on anybody's religion we don't have scientific proof or empirical evidence of it working; such prayer may sometimes have a detrimental effect if the person knew they were prayed for all three would have revolutionized healthcare if proven to work which is very very unlikely   astrology trying to predict the future by studying the motions of the planets for answers non scientific and very popular belief that tries to look scientific; was a major focus of astronomy until science began to disprove it in the 1600s tarot trying to predict the future through dealing a special deck of cards  both would have revolutionized our business planning saving lots of money and lives if true   crystal energy non scientific belief that crystals can store soul energy which can be tapped into and used by human beings if true and correct it would have revolutionized the world's technology by replacing energy sources with crystals   curses and hexes non scientific belief that a person can cause supernatural harm to people and things by doing certain magical rituals and mouthing magical words if it were true the military use of such would have proliferated rather quickly   the title text points out that many people still believe in non scientific unproven and disproved phenomena thus it's possible to make a lot of money by selling those claimed phenomena to such people
