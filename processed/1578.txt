n squirrelphone is a compound word combining squirrel and phone in this comic we see a squirrel pretend to be a telephone only to bite cueball who tries to pick it up and use it as one this is humorous because a living squirrel is not an appropriate creature to maintain a phone call&#91;citation needed&#93; this could be seen as an example of mimicry in nature or parasitism where one creature gains a benefit from another it may be an allusion to the vampire squirrel which was documented recently that allegedly 'attacks and kills' deer  the comic follows the absurd conclusion that the squirrel uses mimicry to 'attack and kill' humans  cueball may be lucky to still be alive&#91;citation needed&#93; the sounds the squirrel makes correspond to the tones that the terminals make when you use the pots plain old telephone service in the us  when someone else calls you and the receiver of your phone is on the hook the phone makes loud and long riiing riiiing tones this is the case in the first frame of the comic when you pick the receiver up the phone call is established and no extra noises are made when no phone call is established and you pick up a continuous humming tone is heard meaning the service is up and you can dial someone else's number a dial tone if a phone is left off hook for too long a loud howler tone is played this is to alert anyone present that the phone is off hook in this case you should hang up so that you can receive calls once on hook the receiver can be picked up again to dial many cordless phones will also beep if left off their cradles for too long to warn that their rechargeable batteries are getting drained  squirrels have been used frequently in xkcd also in what if where it has for instance been used as a cute animal to replace a drawing of something scary or unpleasant like in blood alcohol or cannibalism so this is some twist for the cuteness factor of squirrels in xkcd it may also be the case that squirrelphone is a reference to the popular web mail software squirrelmail the title text takes the joke further by showing the squirrel possesses another phone feature that cordless phones need to recharge frequently either by setting them at their cradles or by connecting them to a charger in the case of mobile phones when they sense the battery is low they emit a beeping noise every few minutes in this case the stump is the squirrel's cradle
