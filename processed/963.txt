n x11 is the x window system commonly x window system or x11 based on its current major version being 11 it is a computer software system and network protocol that provides a basis for graphical user interfaces guis and rich input device capability for networked computers the x11 stacks are usually implemented using a display server the reason that it is called a display server is that the actual viewer and the server do not need to be on the same system; x11 frequently runs over a network connection this adds considerably to the complexity of the mechanism most unix based operating systems including linux and the bsds use x11 as their base graphical subsystem and thus always use a display server and a display client macosx has built in support for x11 but does not use it for normal applications for windows commercial and free solutions implementing an x11 display client exist until 2004 for linux the default display server was xfree86 this project required a variation of the config file that randall mentions it was forked into xorg due to disagreements over the development model xorg is nowadays the default display server xorg server commonly abbreviated to xorg server xserver or just xorg refers to the x server release packages stewarded by the xorg foundation which is hosted by freedesktoporg and provides an interface to the standard x window releases for the use of the free and open source software community every aspect of xfree86 and xorg can be modified in numerous ways all the way down to tiny behaviors such as the default window size window border snapping mouse button maps or how a touchpad is used all of these settings can be found in the xorgconf file a massive file with hundreds upon thousands of individual settings that have accumulated over the lifetime of the xorg project the full documentation for xorgconf contains all the settings contained within the file when a problem arises in the graphical portion of a desktop using the x server the solution may be to edit the xorgconf file the soul crushing prospect of having to open and look up the correct parameter out of thousands that is causing issues is enough to destroy a person's satisfaction with their life editing xorgconf especially manually is much less necessary than it used to be  in fact some distributions do not even come with an xorgconf file because everything necessary can be auto detected and/or configured elsewhere the wayland project aims to replace some of x11 and not include any of the cruft that built up over the decades it was started in 2008 way more than 19 years after the aforementioned config file turned into a hell the title text references a letter thomas jefferson wrote to james madison on the popular basis of political authority there are a few quotes that can be pulled to sum up his ideas  to keep our ideas clear when applying them to a multitude let us suppose a whole generation of men to be born on the same day to attain mature age on the same day and to die on the same day leaving a succeeding generation in the moment of attaining their mature age all together let the ripe age be supposed of 21 years and their period of life 34 years more that being the average term given by the bills of mortality to persons who have already attained 21 years of age   in his day most people lived only to age 55 so he supposes that a person reaches maturity at 21 and will live until 55 and then die for the purposes of the other arguments he makes in the letter he also supposes that all the people of a generation are born on the same day and that they will all die on the same day the day they turn 56  then i say the earth belongs to each of these generations during its course fully and in their own right   since only one generation is alive in his example his model allows for that generation to do as they please for their time on earth elsewhere in the letter he describes that each generation should not be able to leave the next generation in a worse position so the debts accrued by one generation must be paid off by that generation this has built us up to the quote that everyone attaches onto  every constitution then and every law naturally expires at the end of 19 years if it be enforced longer it is an act of force and not of rightit may be said that the succeeding generation exercising in fact the power of repeal this leaves them as free as if the constitution or law has been expressly limited to 19 years only   because a generation reaches maturity at 21 and at that point the previous generation dies off and this generation has 19 productive years until they are 40 and have 15 years of senility until their own death they have full reign of the earth as they please continuing on under the laws and debts of the previous generation is an act of force and not of right jefferson picked 19 years because that was the length of time a generation spent in power not that every 19 years all laws should be abolished but that every generation each new generation should tear down all the systems put in place re evaluate and build better laws systems and constitutions
