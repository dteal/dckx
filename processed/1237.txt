n qr codes are a type of 2d barcode that can be scanned using any of several apps on a smartphone this comic illustrates installation of a new application that requires the smartphone to scan a qr code on its own screen there is no conceivable purpose for such a step so it would be completely silly even with two mirrors or a front facing camera and mirror most smartphones would be unable to simultaneously display the camera feed for the qr scanner and the qr code itself the only way to do it would be to take a picture of the qr code with a digital camera and then scan the screen of the camera the 12 seconds remaining part indicates that there is a time limit for this however if scanned the qr code in the comic reads http//xkcdcom/1237/scan/ a link to a nearly identical image but the line above the qr code reads to continue reading and the caption reads how to trap a webcomic reader in an infinite loop the qr code is identical to the previous one so if scanned again it would simply return the scanner to the same image in an infinite loop
