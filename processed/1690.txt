n in this comic randall uses time tracking software which is intended to increase productivity by identifying how you are spending time that reveals that he is doing frivolous and pointless things that take up large amounts of his time he makes remixes edits star wars footage reads strange albeit entertaining wikipedia articles see 214 the problem with wikipedia and even spends a large amount of time adjusting this software all without getting anything useful done thus he is embarrassed at this revelation this time waste is a common subject on xkcd as shown for instance in the comic mentioned above the visual appearance of lightsabers in the star wars movies of the original trilogy has been digitally changed twice during the re releases for the 2004 dvd and 2011 blu ray releases there are several star wars fans that feel the need to alter the movies mainly to revert the changes made in the re release but so far nobody felt the need to replace lightsabers with metal swords jack &amp; diane is a rock song written in 1982 by john mellencamp suckin' on a chili dog outside the tastee freeze is the first line of the second verse of the song see the lyrics here a remix made using just this line would probably sound a bit repetitive listen for instance to this re mix of don't you want me that almost only uses the first line of the song two wikipedia lists are mentioned in the comic and title text; list of helicopter prison escapes and list of sexually active popes given that the pope is supposed to be celibate at least after 1139 the mere fact that more than ten popes have been involved in sexual activity even after 1139 is both amusing and intriguing there are more than forty entries in the helicopter escape list for real life attempts plus 16 in fiction; not all of them succeeded but several did this xkcd comic was published on june 6th on that day the wikipedia article list of helicopter prison escapes involving sexually active popes was created and subsequently deleted on june 7th the wikipedia facebook page posted a link to the list of helicopter prison escapes article a user commented asking if the article was posted on facebook due to the xkcd comic and wikipedia replied by pasting an image of the xkcd comic which seems to indicate that the wikipedia representative running the facebook page was aware of this xkcd comic and posted the list in reference to the comic in the title text randall mentions his disappointment with the lack of a wikipedia list stemming from the intersection of the two; that is a helicopter prison escape involving a sexually active pope with the last sexually active pope being pope leo xii in the 1820s and helicopter predecessors only taking flight in 1907 and mass production of helicopters not occurring until the 1950s such an event has probably never happened the wikipedia list of sexually active popes has been mentioned before in the what if into the blue on infinitely powerful lasers and after noting that such a thing cannot exist the list is offered as a replacement for entertainment the comic 1692 man page was released later that week and also mentioned the pope
