n another fine example of nerd sniping there are pieces of circuit diagrams road maps chemical diagrams and other things all mixed in explanations for each below    image fragment   image location  description        106xc3x9737 @ 1925   a map scale lists kilometers and miles as equivalent and makes the diagram many miles wide         40xc3x9785 @ 1562   an antenna typical of radio receivers or transmitters or the turtle in logo programming language         41xc3x9787 @ 5360   a coil or inductor normal but unlabeled         85xc3x9793 @ 10786   a cloverleaf interchange or junction is a feature of road networks that does not belong in a circuit diagram of course other types of junction are important in electronics a cloverleaf junction has previously been used in comic 253 highway engineer pranks          87xc3x9763 @ 18412   a battery the voltage of square root of two is strange but getting about 141412 volts is not unheard of this could also indicate an rms voltage although this is unlikely given that this is a dc power supply and not an ac generator the marked polarity is also the reverse of what is implied by the symbol where the larger terminal is positive a possible reference to 567 urgent mission         94xc3x9771 @ 187110   a 120 ohm resistor is normal enough or to taste is odd for a circuit diagram and more like instructions from a recipe eg 1 tbsp tomato purxc3xa9e or to taste         90xc3x9763 @ 28350   a normal switch with a notation to glue it open reminiscent of the magic/more magic switch         69xc3x9764 @ 337101   a bipolar pnp transistor except that it has two emitters and no collector         79xc3x97107 @ 52141   compass points a map feature not a circuit feature         63xc3x9758 @ 41518   a normal resistor labeled with color code brown blue orange would be 16000 ohms resistor color codes are for reading the value on the physical device itself they would not normally be shown on the circuit diagram where it's much easier to just write the number eg 16k         42xc3x9732 @ 51714   a normal diode         73xc3x9774 @ 61555   a chip the normal timer is a 555 666 would be the number of the beast in rev 1318 the pin connected to  is the ctrl pin on a normal 555 timer which would typically be connected to ground via a decoupling capacitor if used at all; the implication here seems to be that it would be connected directly to hell itself         69xc3x9741 @ 632138   a batman logo         75xc3x9771 @ 650211   a squirrel or perhaps a wire bent into the shape of a squirrel what it does as a circuit element is unclear squirrels have also appeared in past and future xkcd comics         54xc3x9753 @ 606165   a coil or inductor or a spring symbol in physics force diagrams probably the latter as it is labeled with an 11 kilogram mass         99xc3x9759 @ 538209   a 240 volt ac generator or other power source         111xc3x97103 @ 483186   a shorting wire around a generator the label reads omit this if you're a wimp if this wire is included it will quickly melt or worse         57xc3x9775 @ 41978   a jar of scarab beetles         28xc3x9744 @ 48247   a variable resistor with center tap normally there would be an arrowhead on the center tap         22xc3x9727 @ 50753   a normal capacitor         96xc3x9762 @ 577318   magic smoke is the legendary stuff that all circuit components require to function this is why all components cease to function after releasing smoke         51xc3x9766 @ 669315   some frayed or dangling wires         58xc3x9748 @ 567392   an object which is either a float used in fishing a tippe top or perhaps a mine         111xc3x9786 @ 458336   a bridge rectifier which would normally turn alternating current at the top and bottom into direct current on the left and right in this case it is labeled as a moral rectifier this is presumably a play on the idea of moral rectitude xe2x80x93 it makes your circuit more moral why this matters in a circuit is unclear         80xc3x9785 @ 423259   this resembles both the schematic symbol for part of a transformer and the meteorological symbol for a warm front  a warm front is a feature on a synoptic weather map         54xc3x9752 @ 190199   a normal 50 volt battery         89xc3x9756 @ 173200   a battery is grounded on both sides something will melt or burn out quickly unless these are separate earth grounds in which case the ground might get a bit cooked         174xc3x9725 @ 259198   text reads pull this wire really tight this kind of physical property issue may indicate a high frequency radio device  or given the absurdity of the context it's a silly reference to a high tension wire         41xc3x9791 @ 141211   a specified 3/8 inch separation this probably indicates a carefully controlled capacitance issue also contradicts the scale of the drawing by which the distance shown would be about 08 miles or 08 km         92xc3x9759 @ 173309   an electric eel  this may be an effective power source in the circuit capable of producing a shock at up to 600 volts and 1 ampere of current 600 watts but for less than 2 ms         35xc3x9741 @ 266307   a normal resistor         34xc3x9729 @ 222358   a normal capacitor         44xc3x9740 @ 130335   a normal resistor labeled &#235;  this may be a play on euler's number which doesn't normally have a trxc3xa9ma or an umlaut alternatively instead of being an umlaut or trxc3xa9ma it may indicate the second derivative of e with respect to time in newton's notation in which case as e is a constant the resistance of this element is zero         61xc3x9792 @ 65249   our best guess is that this is a blender         115xc3x9773 @ 20342   an arduino labeled arduino just for blog cred may refer to the fact that inexpensive easy to integrate single board computers like the arduino which have contributed to the rise of maker_culture are used and discussed frequently in that culture and the use of one might impress readers  the comment implies that an arduino is not otherwise needed in this circuit although it is necessarily hard to tell given the other components of the circuit         118xc3x9782 @ 39423   a chip labeled most expensive chip available the small curve at the top is a part of the packaging designed to show its orientation         91xc3x9750 @ 159428   labeled neck strap perhaps a piece of torture equipment or indicating that the circuit is part of an electric chair  may also be a reference to the grounded wrist straps people working with electronics commonly wear to prevent accidental static discharges from frying the circuitry         110xc3x9788 @ 147480   a switch labeled hire someone to open and close switch real fast possibly meant to perform the function of an oscillator in a more hackish manner and the reason for the neck strap could also be a reference to maxwell's demon         61xc3x9764 @ 273498   a 5 ohm resistor labeled decoy one end is not attached to anything perhaps this indicates wishful thinking that electrons might be tricked into entering this part of the circuit despite the fact that there's nowhere for them to go         103xc3x9756 @ 307453   a pair of contacts labeled touch tongue here  could be referring to the practice of daring someone to touch their tongue to the contacts of a 9v battery         45xc3x9745 @ 301270   a frowny face see the float/mine         128xc3x97124 @ 294311   a small integrated circuit the lower gate is an inverter wired as a free running oscillator the upper gate is an xor wired to act as either a free running oscillator or a latch since the xor will be slower than the inverter the overall output of the upper gate is probably very chaotic two input wires are not connected at all an additional wire is attached to the top with hot glue this last wire probably acts to control static electricity and leakage         91xc3x9725 @ 302235   a caution sign at a curve another road feature in the circuit  this is a play on the notion that 90 degree corners on printed circuit board traces can disrupt signal integrity         67xc3x9768 @ 401455   a methyl group chemistry attached to a corner if the circuit were an organic chemical it would be reasonable to find a number of these         43xc3x9793 @ 453167   a balloon possibly blowing in a breeze         22xc3x9743 @ 57268   a coil or inductor         42xc3x9720 @ 50896   a coil or inductor         22xc3x9731 @ 53461   a ground connection         134xc3x97140 @ 47249   a solder blob covering a portion of the circuit normally this would not be part of the circuit diagram but a mistake in building the circuit         207xc3x97158 @ 493443   a rats nest of 1 ohm resistors it is labeled oh so you think you're such a whiz at ee201 the name ee201 electrical engineering 201 follows us course naming conventions for what appears to be a basic level course in electrical engineering compare the term 101 which would include being taught how to calculate the effective resistance of various resistor networks performing the calculation on a network this complex would probably be extremely difficult it appears to work out to 075800964845 ohms         232xc3x97200 @ 315533   an arena with a few bodies in it note the direction of movement enforced by the surrounding diodes two men enter one man leaves a film reference         47xc3x9751 @ 569653   a pi ohm resistor         75xc3x9770 @ 610655   a 500 volt ac generator the wiring to the right shorts out this generator         85xc3x9764 @ 481682   a ground connection labeled bury deep but not too deep this type of ground connection is called an earth ground the too deep part might be a reference to moria in lord of rings the dwarves dug too deeply and disturbed a balrog see also comic 760         75xc3x9773 @ 17610   a ground connection at the end of a curve looking like a fishhook means perhaps earthed down under ie australia or the southern hemisphere         66xc3x9745 @ 206662   a length of wire is labeled yarn this probably makes it a terrible conductor         93xc3x9788 @ 102590   the flux capacitor from back to the future         54xc3x9724 @ 138685   a road sign for i 95 interstate 95 is the main north south highway on the east coast of the united states running from maine to florida         134xc3x9736 @ 12713   a connection labeled to center of sun a 93 million mile circuit is rather large but         144xc3x97177 @ 31753   a rat's nest of wires everything winds up being connected may also be a parody diagram of an undirected graph from graph theory         97xc3x9761 @ 22513   a label reading electrons single file if this happens the resistance in this section of wire would be rather high         29xc3x9739 @ 256619   a ground connection         58xc3x9746 @ 589600   a vibrator which would be a motor with an off center weight attached to it         74xc3x9752 @ 532779   a motor labeled to scale this indicates that the physical size and shape of the motor must match the size of the parts around it or is consistent with the specified scale of the drawing         73xc3x97109 @ 662822   a ground connection in a beaker labeled holy water possibly creating holy ground         48xc3x9755 @ 197740   a sign indicating a speed limit of 55 mph this is a rather typical road sign but inappropriate for a circuit diagram         100xc3x97116 @ 238706   a pair of nor gates wired as a sr set reset flip flop the label reads may use an actual sandal instead which is a play on the meanings of the term flip flop         70xc3x9754 @ 322708   something that could be the side view of a fence labeled holding pen         42xc3x9749 @ 339777   a simple overhand knot also looks like a pretzel which would have pretty high resistance         149xc3x9733 @ 191889   this appears to be an electrocardiograph ecg trace but not the sort that would be seen in a healthy person if this were a real ecg trace the absence of large clear p waves might indicate fine atrial fibrillation but in some recording configurations p waves are sometimes lost in the noise anyway additionally without a time scale to tell us the ventricular heart rate it is impossible to make a strong educated diagnosis of any hypothetical disease at all if we assume it is atrial fibrillation is not clear if randall intended this or if he is just not familiar with how a normal ecg should look lastly it does not appear that this is an actual ecg machine but simply a bent wire much like the not a resistor label nearby         82xc3x9768 @ 223826   a photodiode labeled tear collector a photodiode is a light sensing device         49xc3x9768 @ 373859   a lamp this is not the symbol used in electrical circuits but a drawing of a lightbulb         65xc3x9732 @ 450887   a coil or inductor         120xc3x9772 @ 537847   a coil or inductor labeled take off shirt while wiring this part ooh yeah i like that         34xc3x9741 @ 504860   a resistor labeled  presumably this means the resistance is unknown         55xc3x9738 @ 459828   a resistor labeled yes likely another improper unit a reference to boolean values yes true and no false depending on the limits of a circuit a resistor would still have a yes boolean value possibly indicating that this is a real resistor as opposed to the one above it in the circuit labeled not a resistor         58xc3x9753 @ 389774   a resistor labeled 8 mm         93xc3x9784 @ 443747   a resistor labeled not a resistor; wire just does this apparently the wire is or must be physically bent into a zig zag shape which would not serve much useful purpose in a low frequency or dc circuit or perhaps it reflects the fact that any wire has a certain small amount of resistance just by being a wire in a high frequency circuit this can be actually useful as the shape and length of the transmission line alters the impedance of the line example         82xc3x9724 @ 415863   a symbol for a feedthrough capacitor labeled 3 liters probable word play on capacity/capacitor also similar to the symbol for an orifice or flow restriction used on plumbing or hydraulic diagrams in which case the 3 liters might mean 3 liters per minute or per second
