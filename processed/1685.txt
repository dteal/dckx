n adobe photoshop is a commonly used application for image manipulation one of its features is the patch tool which allows the user to overwrite parts of the image replacing them with a copy of another area of the same image it is often used for xe2x80x9cpatching upxe2x80x9d photographs by overwriting scratches or other visible damage to the photo another of photoshopxe2x80x99s features is xe2x80x9ccontent aware fillxe2x80x9d which could also be described as xe2x80x9ccontent aware inpaintingxe2x80x9d it works similarly to the patch tool but automatically generates a replacement texture from the area surrounding the deleted part instead of copying a user specified area exactly gnu patch is a program that replaces only parts of code with an updated version without requiring the user to download the entire source code here it appears the author was told to xe2x80x9cpatchxe2x80x9d the code but used photoshop to do this instead of gnu patch with devastating results although the title text suggests that if you did this enough times the code would eventually compile this would never happen in fact photoshop could only edit an image of the text and not the text itself however it could work if optical character recognition ocr were integrated into the workflow as well the comic blurs the difference between text in which letters and symbols represent discrete values such as 65 being the number for the letter a in the ascii encoding standard and it's relatively easy for a program compiler to interpret combinations of these values as keywords and other programming constructs and graphics where the letters and symbols in the comic are actually represented by pattern of colored dots playing with the idea that the patch metaphor can be used on both although with different meanings there are common and straightforward processes for converting text information to images such as printing which can convert text to a graphics format very faithfully the reverse however requires the use of optical character recognition ocr which attempts to figure out which letter or symbol certain patterns of dots look like ocr could be effective in converting some of the image in the comic back to usable text however it would fail on some of those patterns that have been mangled and don't look like any existing characters or symbols a compiler can only operate on text data so converting the graphic back into text would be a requirement to even begin to attempt to compile it a step omitted in the title text the code appears to be written in python a programming language often referred to in xkcd a few of the function names that can be recognized are isprime and quicksort both elementary programming algorithms it was also apparently originally edited using a python aware programming text editor which is able to use different colors for different programming elements for example it appears to use red for keywords blue for variables and black for other elements however because of the mangling from the use of the wrong patching program that doesn't appear to be consistent since the patching replaced graphical elements rather than whole characters there are examples of symbols that are combination of two different characters and when the original two characters were rendered in different colors the resulting non character could be in two colors or the resulting word might be rendered in multiple colors the comic brings to attention the high rate of adobe photoshop piracy gnu patch is available for free even for windows and mac os x so the comic implies that adobe photoshop subscription to which costs $20/month is more available than gnu patch according to this poll 58% of photoshop copies were pirated the title text also explains that patch used the content aware inpainting to fill in all the wasted whitespace in the code in most programming languages whitespace is necessary to separate words so this would combine words that shouldnxe2x80x99t be combined and create invalid code since the code in the image is python the code will be messed up even more because python uses whitespace as a part of its programming syntax for example statements are separated by new lines instead of by semicolons ; and indentation is used instead of brackets to determine the scope of each section of code the original code was likely as follows  import re def isprimen tif n&lt;=1 ttreturn false tfor i in range2 intn**05+1 ttif n%i==0 tttreturn false treturn true def isprimeregexn tif rematchr'^1$|^11+1+$' '1'*n  ttreturn false treturn true def quicksorta tif lena &lt;
