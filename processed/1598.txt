n the rms titanic was a large ocean liner which when it was completed in 1912 was the largest ship afloat the ship famously hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank killing two thirds of its complement approximately 1500 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters ever as it sank the titanic broke into two pieces the ship was lost for decades until the wreck site was discovered in 1985 a number of proposals have been made to salvage the wreck of the titanic both before and since the wreck's discovery famously fictionalised in the thriller novel and film raise the titanic there could be a joke on this title as in rice the titanic even though it would not be possible to mistake the two words when spoken in the majority of dialects of english the general consensus at this time is that the wreck is too fragile to be salvaged intact numerous expeditions have been made to the wreck site since its discovery with several parties without any outside authorization taking various artifacts from the site a popular view is that the wreck is effectively a mass grave and that plundering the site for profitable artifacts is akin to grave robbing most believe the wreck should be left where it is intact that said explorers have already done notable damage to the wreck this comic shows a fictional attempt to salvage the two main pieces of the titanic wreck which as it likely would in real life garners media coverage as a 'historic salvage' the salvage seems to consist of several ships raising the hull via cables attached to some sort of buoyant sled placed under the hull as might actually happen this is followed by helicopters carrying the hull in unison again via cables to the cradle a much less practical operation the hull halves are then dropped into a giant tub of rice the entire salvage attempt is increasingly cartoonish and unrealistic but the tub of rice takes this to another level also the two parts of the titanic collapsed when hitting the sea floor and thus could not be moved as shown in the comic see this video of how titanic sank the punchline to the comic references the rice myth as randall calls it a popularly disseminated method of salvaging consumer electronics usually cell phones which have been submerged in water see research shows rice is the answer for a wet mobile the method entails burying the wet device in a bowl of rice this process is commonly claimed to dry the device but investigation reveals that the process is only mildly effective though not entirely a myth either see below this comic likely plays on the dual meaning of the word salvage in respect of electronics and maritime wrecks the comic suggests that the wreck of the titanic would benefit from being dried as quickly as possible in a humorous contrast to actual reality surviving non metallic material on board the ship may not benefit at all from drying far more ancient shipwrecks are best preserved by keeping the recovered timbers wet but progressively desalinated where applicable cool and anoxic at least while conserving chemicals such as polyethylene glycol are infused into the wood to allow safe and gradual drying without causing further damage leather cloth and other organic remains may have variations on this regime thus the rice might benefit an electronic device briefly exposed to water but is not likely to benefit a ship that has been immersed for over a century where the interest is in more than merely stabilizing the remaining metal hull and infrastructure there are numerous on line discussions of the technique with mixed levels of success critically where rice is tested against other methods rice appears to perform worse than other methods controlled experiments on this topic tend to show that silica gel aka the do not eat packets often found in boxes with electronics or pharmaceuticals is the most effective drying agent with mixed results for rice see myth debunked uncooked rice isn't the best way to save your water damaged phone where it turns out that leaving the phone to air dry may actually be the best solution the title text tells of another hobby of randall's he likes to take advantage of the rice myth to post fake articles on how to save your wet cell phone but the instructions turn out to be elaborate recipes for rice pilaf it is unclear whether randall's instructions would explain how to prepare the rice prior to inserting a phone thus resulting a usable dish or if the instructions would require the phone to be inserted into the dish before it became clear that the dish was a recipe for food and not a phone saving measure thus worsening the condition of the phone this may also be a punishment by randall to anyone who would follow instructions blindly before reading them through as a recipe for rice pilaf would likely be distinguishable from phone saving instructions by someone who read the instructions through before attempting them or it may just be that randall considers those who would follow instructions for saving a phone with rice that they find on the internet gullible enough to believe the seasonings and other ingredients would have a curative effect on electronics
