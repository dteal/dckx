n michael phelps is an american olympic swimmer who could easily be considered the best swimmer worldwide he is the most decorated olympic athlete of all time with 28 medals 23 of them gold won in the 2004 2008 2012 and 2016 summer olympics he was most dominant in the 2008 beijing olympics where he won gold in all of the eight events in which he competed the record for a single games this comic is a take on the idea that michael phelps being irritatingly fast and uncatchable in a pool a quirky yet simple trick one might imagine to nullify his pool supremacy would be to turn the water into jello a gelatine product by simply dropping a huge quantity of jello powder in the pool in the comic cueball and megan try to get rid of michael phelps as if he were a common pest like an animal who is swimming in megan's pool as they can't catch him since he swims too fast and taunts them about it cueball resorts to the jello trick bringing big boxes of jello powder to stop and catch him however according to the title text after having waited the time necessary for the water to solidify cueball realizes that phelps has eaten all of the resulting jello this may be a reference to phelps being used to eating impressive food quantities about 12000 calories daily to keep up with his strenuous exercise regimen;1 or it may be a reference to pictures of phelps smoking from a bong that arose after the 2008 olympics in beijing china as marijuana use is often associated with an increased appetite otherwise the text may simply be a reference to phelps being capable of achieving super human feats such as devouring an entire pool full of jello
