n chess is a centuries old board game in which two players take turns moving one of their 16 pieces to try and checkmate the other player's king one of the pieces when one player is in a position to capture his or her opponent's king on their next move and the opponent has no legal move available to avoid such capture the opponent is said to be in checkmate this is considered to be the end of the game with a win for the first player; though chess etiquette suggests that a player facing inevitable checkmate ought to resign at that point the game with origins around the 6th century and with the modern rules being essentially set in the late 15th century has a significant amount of history the rules and traditions are well established the knight is a piece that can only move in an l shaped pattern two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular but has the unique ability to jump over other pieces the comic highlights two mistakes players often make in chess complete fixation on the king at the cost of their other pieces and failure to take advantage of the knight's movement patterns at the same time this is a jab at how people sometimes oversimplify an argument when confronted with a topic they are not familiar with previously this was depicted in 675 revolutionary and 793 physicists see also the dunningxe2x80x93kruger effect the units in chess are widely agreed to be well balanced and cueball's criticism of the knight shows an obvious lack of knowledge of the knight's potential given the long history of chess a significant amount of writing and research has been dedicated to the game and its strategies this is inadvertently mocked by cueball who naively suggests it would be trivial to make a list of all situations in which a piece would move backwards called a retreat in chess such a list xe2x80x94 at least a partial one xe2x80x94 certainly does exist as do lists of numerous other chess moves and situations cueball's friend a guy with knit cap see the official transcript proceeds to demonstrate cueball's lack of knowledge by beating him in four moves which typically would only occur when an experienced player plays a novice the checkmate depicted is likely the scholar's mate and is one of the classic checkmates in chess cueball instead of admitting he underestimated the game believes the failure is in the game itself the title text indicates that cueball attempted to suggest revisions to the rules of chess given that cueball has no experience as a chess player it is likely many of the changes are illogical or ridiculous in the face of hundreds of years of history it is not surprising that the chess community is ignoring them the last major changes to the rules of chess occurred more than 400 years ago when among other things the pawn was given its two space starting move and the queen was made into the most powerful piece previously it was the weakest the chess community's ties to the traditions of the game and their refusal to accept cueball's suggestions are written off by cueball as emotional bias suggesting his changes are logical but that the community is letting their emotions cloud their rational decision making abilities the comic may also be a jab at competitive online games whose fans call for buffs power additions and nerfs power reductions to characters they believe to be underpowered or overpowered often with inadequate knowledge of those characters on the other hand some online games and multiplayer computer games in general are unbalanced since they lack centuries of history to balance themselves unlike chess the guy with the knit cap could either have been a man or a woman as from the drawing but the official transcript calls him knit hat guy in the two other cases after this comic were a person with hair have been shown with a knit cap it has been women the first was randall's wife after chemotherapy in 1141 two years and the second time it was knit cap girl in 1350 lorenz two cueballs have also been shown using knit caps in 1321 cold
