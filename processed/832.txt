n in what follows we will use numpad notation for tic tac toe ie  7|8|9+ +   4|5|6+ +   1|2|3  pixel values are taken from http//xkcdcom/832_large/ each map shows every possible combination of moves which will result in that side winning or tying it assumes that x moves first and its optimal move is x7 any corner would do so x1 x3 and x9 are also optimal moves the map for x has a big red x7 650&#215;650 pixels and the 8 remaining grids have a smaller 210&#215;210 black x7 the map for o has more combinations because in this case x is not assumed to be optimal all 9 subgrids have one big 210&#215;210 black x and one big red o note that only optimal moves are shown for example you can't find a grid beginning with x2 in map of x because x2 is not an optimal move in map for o you can find a 660&#215;660 grid beginnig with x2 since the optimal answer is o5 you won't find x2 o8 for example  example 1  the largest red x in map for x is x7 this means that o must go to cell 7 in  map for o the largest red o in this subgrid is the center cell o5 therefore x must magnify cell 5 in the map for x and look for a big red x which is x3 ie in the cell 6 4 in a 9&#215;9 grid this can be repeated until one of the players wins or there is a tie  example 2  download http//xkcdcom/832_large/ and edit it delete the upper part now you have a picture sized 2040&#215;2150 pixels with title map for o assume x used the center cell x5 you as o must magnify the center cell in the 3&#215;3 map for o better still select that cell and delete everything else now you have a picture sized 670&#215;670 pixels with a big red o7 and a big black x5 you must move o7 this time  o| |+ +   |x| + +   | |  assume x moves x9   o| |x+ +   |x| + +   | |  in your drawing program you select cell 9 which is 220&#215;220 pixels look for the biggest red o which is o1 you can see you blocked a winning move  o| |x+ +   |x| + +  o| |  now x naively plays x3  o| |x+ +   |x| + +  o| |x  you select cell 3 in your drawing program which is 73&#215;73 pixels and looks like this  o| |x+ +  o|x| + +  o| |x  the o in cell 4 is red which is your winning move  title text  the title text is a reference to the 1983 movie wargames in that movie by playing tic tac toe the ai realizes that some games cannot be won when all the players play flawlessly and subsequently concludes that the only way to win at the nuclear warfare game is not to play
