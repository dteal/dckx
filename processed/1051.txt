n this comic is a reference to how an internet browser will make the links of the pages that you have visited a different color than the links that you have not visited in the case of wikipedia and other wikis powered by mediawiki they are blue for non visited and purple for visited in this comic randall is ashamed of the pages he has visited because with the color changes there is evidence of what he has visited in the past eg autoerotic asphyxiation possibly while researching 682 force which features that  very wikipedia page also the pages that he did visit before are in great contrast with the pages that he hasn't pages he didn't click are often difficult highly intelligent topics while he only clicks the easy funny articles with little scientific background on the wikipedia site the title text refers to a common mistake many people make when reading articles on wikipedia words referring to subjects that have an article on wikipedia are coloured in blue this however can cause confusion when two words leading to two separate articles appear together as the two links appear to be one however on hovering the cursor over the article link only one word at a time is underlined showing that the links are separate it is not possible to determine who this fake article is supposed to be about but the macarena band is certainly from dos hermanas spain so it is quite possibly a made up article from randall
