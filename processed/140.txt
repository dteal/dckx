n the simplest explanation for the comic is the recipe for nachos you take some tortilla chips spread them out on a plate sprinkle them with grated cheese and perhaps some other ingredients like salsa beans or guacamole and put the plate in the oven until the cheese is melted as usual with a full bag of snacks you always end up with that tiny bit left at the bottom of the bag in this case it is either leftover grated cheese left or tortilla chips right so you end up buying another package of the other ingredient to make nachos again  this is an example of a virtuous or vicious cycle in which a feedback loop reinforces itself a virtuous cycle has favorable results while a vicious has detrimental results in this case it is neither a virtuous or vicious cycle but a delicious cycle the pun of this joke the title text just says that currently randall has leftover cheese he will probably get chips soon continuing the cycle the same problem with having leftovers when making a dish using two types of food that doesn't match up is the setup for the joke in 1641 hot dogs
