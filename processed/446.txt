n wikipedia is a popular online encyclopedia with articles that are created and edited by the general public citation required  wikipedia entries have many sections with the first few explaining the general concept and details behind the subject when this comic was written many wikipedia articles had a section at the end entitled in popular culture listing tv shows movies songs and so on which made reference to the subject at hand in many cases this list was extensive possibly because the people editing the articles were such fans of the subject or the pop culture in which it is referenced they couldn't help but go into great detail listing many esoteric and seemingly irrelevant elements of pop culture which were peripherally related to the subject of the article as an example see the old article apollo in popular culture which as of august 2007 redirects to apollo the joke in this case is that even such a mundane article such as one on wood could have an in popular culture section and obviously wooden items are common enough that there are any number of instances of popular culture which could be considered to reference it even if that's something as basic as a wooden item being used as a prop in a tv show such information would be of little or no use to anybody and only somebody obsessed with wood a particular element of pop culture in which wood makes an appearance or the concept of placing pop culture references in encyclopedia articles would bother to create or maintain such a section also wood being such a popular material the list of references could be virtually endless this is a reference to the fact that the in popular culture sections of many wikipedia articles contained dozens of items even for articles on fairly arcane subjects note that the end of this particular in popular culture section is not visible so we don't know how long it is the title text states that in the future there will even have to be a wiki page with the subject in popular culture this article will also need an in popular culture section and it will be obvious to make a reference directly to this title text as xkcd is part of popular culture and because this title text predicted the creation of and need for such a page however this would then create a circular reference this could be considered a form of infinite loop which is one way to cause a computer to crash lock up the joke is that the blogosphere could follow this endless train of circular links and itself crash causing an implosion this comic was mentioned in wikipediain popular culture content however on april 23 2014 the reference was edited out it has since been added under the external links section of wikipediaxkcd in popular culture  the reference was added back in may 2015
