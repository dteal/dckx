n cueball is chatting with white hat who says he is frustrated because a barking dog is preventing him from sleeping and white hat mashes the keyboard to show his frustration keyboard mashing is often used in this way where the user makes their hands spasm across the keyboard creating a line of text that can be compared to an angry groan in real life cueball is about to give some advice but is confused by a quirk in what white hat typed all the characters he typed except one were on the home row of the qwerty keyboard the row starting with the letters a s d and f in the middle of the keyboard the letters a s d f j k and l all from the home row are scattered throughout the text but there is a 7 which comes from the numbers row on top of the keyboard in the middle of this text cueball wonders how white hat put a seven in there because if white hat was keyboard mashing and touched the 7 key he likely would have hit any of the qwerty row keys because of keyboard mashing hand spasms but he didn't all the other characters were on the home row white hat berates cueball for always focusing on strange tiny details when the final panel shows what's going on where white hat is we see that a giant spider has imprisoned him in a web and is talking to cueball which explains how the keyboard mashing white hat did was strange the reason the dog was barking appears to be because the giant spider was lurking nearby little did white hat know that the dog was alerting him of the spider when the spider notices that white hat mentions the barking dog to cueball the spider apparently restrains white hat and takes over typing another possibility is that the dog barking is actually white hat as he is seen making grunts from beneath the spider's silk it can be seen in the last panel that the spider is typing with 3 legs which explains how the 7 key would have been pressed the statement i am a normal human typing with my human hands is an oddly specific assertion from the giant spider that it is actually a human a claim that would normally be taken for granted and had not really been cast into doubt by cueball's inquiries about how 7 got into a string of home row keystrokes the title text invitation ends with a similar statement suggesting that they chat about our internal skeletons which spiders unlike humans do not possess this implies that the spider also wants to trap and possibly eat cueball as well or actually hang out with him in an attempt to make friends hang out inside my house may also have a double meaning as white hat is actually hanging from the ceiling inside his house also another oddity is that the spider asks cueball to cook bread although bread is actually baked and in any case this isn't a common pastime during the night the final oddity is that the title text is written in all caps which is usually interpreted as shouting and would not be used in a casual invitation the central theme of the comic is a vindication of cueball's world view wherein tiny oddities such as the appearance of a numeral in a keyboard mash merit investigation in the real world the appearance of a 7 in the middle of a home row keyboard mash is more likely attributable to key ghosting in the title text of 1541 voice there is again a reference to a sentence that could be uttered correctly by a human but would never be used in real life but a non human entity that tries to blend in as a human may inadvertently use such a wrong sentence to try to ensure other people think they are indeed humans it is a direct reference to the type of sentence used in the title text here
