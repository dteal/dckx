n it is very common that online input forms demand that one's email address is typed twice and also quite common that pasting into the second field is disabled so that there is no escape if a form asks for some information that is really much more crucial and this standard routine thoughtlessly isn't used for those fields too it would comically seem that the form makers consider your email address to be hideously important in the comic the impression is that it is less important that the wrong city is not accidentally wiped out than that the boss  knows who to blame afterwards the title text suggests a real world parallel to this randall has heard about differing priorities of identifying who is purchasing a firearm the state/locality requires one form of identification and ensuring the payment the store requires two forms of id to properly document the person in case the check is fake or is rejected by the bank the point is that people often care a lot about money but a gun in the wrong hands is a potential disaster bigger than a few hundred missing dollars this is the only comic so far to feature green hat it appears that the green hat means that he is part of the military
