n in this comic cueball is bored so he is calculating the prime factors of the time shown on the clock cueball has been doing this for almost two hours from 100 pm to 253 pm the number 2 is the smallest prime but is not a factor of 253 which is an odd number the smallest prime factor of 253 is 11 which makes the other factor 23 his co worker decides to mess with cueball and so he switches the clock from 12 hour time 253 pm to 24 hour time 1453 this makes factorization more difficult as the time now shown is a four digit number rather than a three digit number the number 1453 is actually a prime number and so has no factors but one and itself cueball has less than one minute to determine this which is nearly impossible to do without practice  in the title text randall claims he applies the same challenge to highway location markers at highway speeds 60+ mph they would show up at least once per minute combined with the need to also concentrate on driving factorizing numbers in the allowed time becomes much more difficult despite the lower numbers on the markers another thing he might do is change the mile markers to kilometre markers because as with the clock format the latter is more common outside of the usa that would result in the marker being a 16 larger number and thus harder to factor of course factoring is now a secondary problem
