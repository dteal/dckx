n many news websites allow users to post comments on an article the intention is that users can debate the stances or implications made by the article on most sites comments are displayed in chronological order this puts the oldest comments at the top and newest at the bottom there are many pitfalls to allowing comments but this comic refers to one in particular most users are too busy to read more than just the top few comments therefore if you were able to control the content of those comments your opinions would be the ones that the majority of users read if you pay people to do nothing but read the site you ensure that they will be the first ones to see the article and that their comments that you pay them to write will be at the top of the page in this scenario the comments being posted appear to convey a particular political belief the advantage of this is according to randall that it would be much cheaper to employ a college student to perform that task than pay a website for an advertisement also the fact that it is a comment posted by another reader would make it seem as though the opinion was coming from the general population and not a politician or company as an advertisement would imply and $20/hour is significantly higher than the minimum wage so you'd have no trouble finding willing participants among college students who are often broke this comic is a continuation of 937 tornadoguard which stated the problem with star ratings apparently every possible comment ordering policy has its own problems the title text refers to reddit's conversation threading system which allows users to vote comments up or down and then sorts them by the resulting karma score total up votes minus total down votes the same problem persists to some extent after a few comments are posted and some votes are cast the handful of comments having received the highest scores among the first dozen of so will receive far better chances at being seen and voted on than comments posted later and will solidify their places in a positive feedback loop in this way a few persistent voices can still dominate the discussion contrary to the claim in the title text thus creating irony the comic's title refers to a once common form of online posturing where the first user to see the article will comment first post or even just first the intent is that everyone else see that they were there first and therefore must be somehow better than you this is referred to in both 269 tcmp and 1258 first
