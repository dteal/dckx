n in this comic we see megan and beret guy both holding on to skyward lines megan's line is clearly connected to a kite and she like the reader initially assumes that beret guy's line is as well  only for it to be revealed that he is not holding a line for a kite but instead the line goes up to a small dog this move on randall's part is known as a bait and switch a technique that relies on human intuition and pattern seeking in order to play a trick on the viewer the 'switch' portion of the bait and switch comes with the added humor of an unconventional dog that flies/floats instead of walking on the ground so the joke comes as a surprise and with little warning to the reader the title text reverses the joke implying that rather than beret guy returning to the park with a kite his dog has returned to the park with beret guy flying in the air on the kite hence he calls down from above that kites are fun beret guy is generally fond of unconventional approaches to standard conventional issues it is unclear if he is somehow causing his dog to fly or if the dog's flight is simply due to its tail wagging rapidly but beret guy is known to possess several strange powers of which this could be yet another one the title text suggests that he does have the ability to fly on the kite himself and to direct his dog to control the kite as well the comic's title is the plural form for kite this may be to distinguish this comic from another earlier comic that used the singular form of the word as its title 235 kite or just because at the end of this comic there are two kites present in the first kite comic it was possible for cueball to climb up the line of his kite and he thus had the same ability as beret guy with a kite a kid looking like megan is also seen with a kite to the left in the game comic 1608 hoverboard from two weeks earlier; probably not a coincidence in the same comic beret guy is flying down from the sky on a torpedo maybe he could just fly off before it hits and explodes this comic is similar to the yo mama panel in 1037 umwelt where dogs can float and thus need a ballast to be on the ground it could also be a variation on the joke of walking around with a stiff leash and collar thus presenting the illusion of walking an invisible dog flying dogs is mentioned in the title text of 1625 substitutions 2 although dogs is substituted instead of drones there may be a reference to this flying dog here
