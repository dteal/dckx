n this comic is a joke parodying wedding ceremonies and american football plays intended to misdirect or fool the opponents about what is really happening a standard misdirection play involves the offense misdirecting the defense into thinking that the play being executed is actually a different play such as that a passing play is a running play that a ball being run left is actually being run right or that a field goal or punt end up being attempted to get a first down in this comic cueball is about to get married to amy a girl looking like megan but the bride interrupts the ritual by saying that she doesn't want to get married the bride then reveals herself to be a cueball like man and after questioning reveals that the relationship and the wedding was an elaborate con to get the advantage on the football field amy turns out to be a player for the opposing team and he had a football on his person he then proceeds to run the ball in for a touchdown this clearly constitutes the greatest high school football misdirection play of all time  randall takes the deception in a misdirection play to the next virtually impossible level; it is unlikely that a relationship could develop to the point of marriage within the time frame of a football game with the groom not noticing that amy was in fact a football player or that he was standing on the football field the title text indicates that in spite of the deception the groom still has feelings and is not ready to give up the relationship or at least like to share a beer with the opposing team like after a friendly game
