n this is randall's take on the story of moria in the fantasy story lord of the rings in the original the dwarves hunting for the precious metal mithril dug so deep that they awoke a balrog xe2x80x94 maiar corrupted by morgoth however in this version they simply got stuck down in their mine however gandalf's final line may be a hint that the comic's version is closer to the original than it appears xe2x80x94 in the story the adventuring party discovers a journal of the last dwarves to occupy moria the last page starts ominously we cannot get out we cannot get out that memorable sentence is used again near the end of the page as the impending final orcish attack is described by the now dead dwarves and repeated by gimli as they reflect on the terrible news lending a much darker tone to the comic's punchline the title text suggests a mundane solution to their problem xe2x80x94 a long ladder the endless stair was a very long staircase from the lowest dungeon up to the top of the mountain above moria
