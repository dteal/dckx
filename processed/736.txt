n here cueball appears to be putting blame on someone who died this could be a result of  the deceased insisting on a font that was not sans serif for his tombstone but the results were typographically unappealing but permanent not the least because the deceased is no longer available to change his mind the deceased having died because he used a font that was not sans serif cueball being forced to kill the person who is now deceased due to him giving cueball something that was in a font that was not the sans serif font for which cueball asked  in any way the onlookers seem horrified at this sight what they do not know is that cueball is arguing with his still alive co worker who got into quite a bit of trouble due to using a font that was not sans serif despite cueball having the knowledge that a sans serif font was better cueball is actually using a bluetooth headset that allows one to speak without actually touching the cell phone the problem is that since the headset is a small object attached to the user's ear while the phone is out of sight someone using a bluetooth headset may give the impression that he is talking to himself or again to a person who happens to be in front of him even if the unintended recipient is dead the title text suggests that cueball is not on good terms with his mother thus meriting a worse argument the problem is that cueball was in front of a different tombstone thus giving the impression that he had an even worse grudge against his deceased mother said impression thrusting worse problems into cueball
