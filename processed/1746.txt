n       this explanation may be incomplete or incorrect more on real problems with making friends more on cueball's crazy plan any reference to someone actually capturing vultures like this maybe even a real animalif you can address this issue please edit the page thanks ponytail is complaining to cueball that it is hard to make new friends once you are out of school she even has problems just meeting new people let alone making those new people her friends this is a common problem or maybe rather an advantage of going to school in school you are forced together with a group of people you have to see everyday and work together with in groups this is a great catalyst for making new friends in the early grades the kids haven't had time to form many friendships so they are ready to make new friends and later in college the young people often move away from their home town and thus have no friends in their new town and are again ready to make friends later in life it is rare to be put in a similar situation and the people you do meet might already have several friends; for most people there is usually a rather low limit on how many friends it is possible to keep close thus many feel it is hard to make new friends compared to when they went to school cueball has a solution but it is very weird he says he pretends to be injured and then as if he were a weak animal on the savanna he expects other people to begin circling around him not directly to eat him but to take his food shelter and nutrients this is a weird formulation as nutrients is what you get from your food so either he is referring twice to his food or he actually refers to his value as nutrient ie food for another being also it is unlikely for a person to steal his shelter unless this refers to his clothing as the shelter would usually be seen as a normal person's house which is rather hard to take &#91;citation needed&#93; especially if the person is renting and it belongs to someone else he then talks about these possible future friends as if they will descend on him making it sound even more like they are birds hanging above him like vultures but his plan is to start telling these people who are ready to rob him of his life support cool facts about space before they get a chance to descend and then make them like him based on this knowledge and then before they know what hit them they are instantly his friends if this were actually about vultures his method could be used to trap said vultures a trick that might be used to try and capture vultures by tricking them to come down in order to eat them yourself if stuck in a desert etc cueball seems to think this is a fantastic idea as shown by his arm gestures but ponytail seems to think otherwise her comment this explains a lot is probably a reference to other strange habits of cueball that she has observed or his lack of other friends in the title text ponytail mentions that what cueball has just described fits well with the behavior of turkey vultures rather than humans turkey vultures are a type of bird of prey which feeds on carrion they are known to identify and circle weak injured dead or dying animals so they can eat them take their nutrients  as they are animals they would not care about cool facts about space but cueball did seem to talk about other humans in the main comic the title text however goes even further out this line and have cueball cite his mom my mom always told me a turkey vulture is just a friend you haven't met yet usually because you don't smell enough like decaying meat this is  a reference to the old saying a stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet and the action of the vultures eating dead animals smelling of decaying meat would be likely to attract the vultures but it should be noted that this is likely to drive away most other potential human friends as most people don't like the smell of decaying meat &#91;citation needed&#93; also there is very little reason to believe that you could become friends with vultures  although if you get up and show that you are not really injured they are likely to give up and fly away rather than attack you vultures hanging in the air over prey that is about to die was also the subject of 926 time vulture saying cool things about space hoping that people like you was the subject of 1644 stargazing the comic 1485 friendship was not about friendship
