n this comic is about the many different uses of conditional statements in human languages such as those marked by the english word if the most obvious kind of conditional is a statement about conditions and consequences ie causality an expression such as if a then b amounts to asserting that if a is true then b is also true is called conditional probability  if it rains then the air gets cleaner a general law or observation if it rains then they'll cancel the event a prediction  this kind of simple conditional statement is the most common case and has been adapted for use in computer programming and formal logic but consider the following statement  if seattle is always rainy beijing is smoggy just as often  this kind of bleached conditional doesn't at all assert that if the left statement is true the right one needs to be true rather it's just a way of introducing the right statement taken as novel by comparing it with the left one taken for granted as everyone knows seattle is always rainy right well beijing is smoggy just as often so conditionals in language are more varied than those of conditionals when used in logic or programming another kind of linguistic conditional is as follows  there are biscuits in the sideboard if you want some  no one would understand this statement as meaning if you want biscuits they'll magically pop up in the sideboard the if clause if you want some doesn't specify the conditions in which the then clause there are biscuits is true rather it describes the conditions in which it's relevant we can paraphrase it as if you want biscuits then you'll be interested in knowing that there are some in the sideboard if a is true then it's relevant for us to talk of b this construction is known to linguists as relevance conditionals or biscuit conditionals due to jl austin's discussion based on the example above the humor in the comic is based on the difference between simple conditionals and relevance conditionals cueball gets a sms invitation on his phone to a social event i'll be in your city tomorrow if you want to hang out this is an everyday relevance conditional with a meaning like if you want to hang out then it's relevant for you to know that i'll be in your city tomorrow however cueball interprets it as a simple conditional just as in a formal logic under this interpretation the message amounts to a claim that if it's true that cueball wants to hang out then it's also true his conversation partner will be in his city cueball is willfully forcing this interpretation due to his belief that simple conditionals are the only proper ones that is he's being a pedant a pedant is a person who is excessively concerned with formalism accuracy and precision under this deliberate misreading if it's true that cueball wants to hang out then we automatically know the other person's location but if cueball does not want to hang out we don't know anything about their location; they could be in the city or anywhere else since the person is only guaranteed to be in the city if cueball wants to hang out he asks them where they will be if he doesn't the other person then makes an excuse to drop their invitation apparently tiring of his pedantry hence in the caption cueball/randall observes that being pedantic with regard to conditionals is likely to make your friends disinclined to hang out with you so he tries not to be pedantic about it in the title text the initiator of the conversation presents another if a then b conditional if you're done being pedantic we should get dinner in most contexts this kind of if you're done being x utterance marks relevance conditionals cueball assumes so and answers you did it again but the reply is no i didn't which means that this time they're actually using a simple conditional; because if cueball isn't done being a pedant then they think it's a bad idea to have dinner together and since cueball was not finished being pedantic about conditionals then the last no would probably also end up being a no to having dinner the title text and partly the subject of the comic is literally a reference to 725 literally if you know what i mean
