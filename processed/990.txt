n in the united states most grocery stores provide plastic bags for free as well as a bagger whose only job is to bag the groceries xe2x80x94 although sometimes this function is performed by the cashier an exception to this rule might be extreme discount stores such as aldi customers are rarely if ever expected to bag their own groceries even if they bring a reusable bag it follows that sometimes a bagger might become a bit overzealous and use too many bags for too few products this comic is mocking this tendency to go overboard which is incredibly wasteful the last frame takes this practice to its absurd and frustrating end showing a reusable bag that has been double bagged exactly why bags are provided is probably a topic best left to academic discussion but suffice to say that it is the state of the industry in the us perhaps grocery chains are concerned that if they did not provide free plastic bags customers would defect instead to a competitor most shoppers view plastic bags and bagging by the store as givens relatively recently some us jurisdictions have begun to join more and more governments world wide to either ban plastic bags charge customers for them or generate taxes on each sold bag using washington dc randall's home turf example as of 2010 customers are charged a $005 tax again by the local government and not by the grocery store for each plastic bag and receive an equivalent rebate for each reusable bag while today it is accepted as a fact of life the tax angered many at its adoption even spurring some to claim that they would do their shopping in the next state over in this case virginia driving 5 or 10 miles to save 5 or 10 cents this would address the theme of wasting money to save a trivial amount addressed by randall in 951 working the tax has since become accepted as a fact of life and has been quite successful at its initial goal of reducing the amount of bags discarded in area rivers and streams  the title text refers to the idea that while many attempt to make the environmentally conscious decision to bag their groceries with reusable bags thereby keeping plastic bags out of landfills sometimes they forget to bring their bags with them from the car or even leave the bags at home altogether randall is commenting on the sense of euphoria he derives from a relatively simple task remembering to bring the reusable bag to the grocery store rather than the good feeling from helping clean up the environment
