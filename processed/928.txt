n this comic is a parody of fish and sea life identification charts referencing the mimic octopus which as the name implies is able to mimic other animals so all animals and objects found in the sea could actually just be such an animal  the identification chart for south east asian sea life shows 13 creatures mimicked including eight individual fish two of which are not yet recognized and other objects and animals those that can be distinguished are a moorish idol gill from finding nemo a tuna 3rd a clownfish 4th a lionfish 6th and from here the rest can be named a shark a sea lilies an angler fish an anchor a submarine a scuba diver and school of 11 fish finally there is an octopus but where all the other silhouettes are labeled mimic octopus the single octopus is labeled two mimic octopuses which is the pun of this comic  the orson scott card novel that the title text refers to is lost boys a withdrawn eight year old in a troubled family invents imaginary friends who bear the names of missing children publisher's weekly the part of the story that randall is referring to chapter 7 crickets involves a situation where the protagonist stewie is given a c grade for an otherwise impeccable diorama featuring underwater animals involving clay sculptures when only a poster would have sufficed and a well written presentation supposedly because the other children had destroyed the diorama before the end of the day to make matters worse his teacher ms jones had made fun of his project and given the ribbon for first prize to someone else  on inquiring about his father step found out that the principal dr mariner had already made the decision to hand stewie the blue ribbon for first prize as she had reviewed the project before it had been destroyed but ms jones had secretly overruled her behind her back by announcing that another child jj would receive the ribbon so the next day he met up with ms jones after school to have a word on the grading of his project needless to say they ended up arguing about minor issues with mrs jones justifying the reason for her decision on among other things the definition of a 'depiction' whether or not the amount of content was defined by the word count or the number of pages and of the importance of putting the report in a plastic cover the argument finally comes to a head when step points out that there was only one red mark on the project report and that concerned an 'incorrect' pluralization of the word 'octopus'   xe2x80x9cbut mrs jones surely you know that the plural of xe2x80x9coctopusxe2x80x9d is either xe2x80x98octopusxe2x80x99 with nothing added or xe2x80x98octopusesxe2x80x99xe2x80x9d xe2x80x9ci think notxe2x80x9d said mrs jones xe2x80x9cthink again mrs jonesxe2x80x9d she must have realized that she was not on firm ground here xe2x80x9cperhaps xe2x80x98octopusesxe2x80x99 is an alternate plural but ixe2x80x99m sure that xe2x80x98octopixe2x80x99 is the preferredxe2x80x9d xe2x80x9cno mrs jones if you had looked it up you would have discovered that xe2x80x98octopixe2x80x99 is not the preferred spelling it is not a spelling at all the word does not exist except in the mouths of those who are pretending to be educated but in fact are not this is because the xe2x80x98usxe2x80x99 ending of xe2x80x98octopusxe2x80x99 is not a latin nominative singular ending which would form its plural by changing to the letter xe2x80x98ixe2x80x99 instead the syllable xe2x80x98pusxe2x80x99 in xe2x80x98octopusxe2x80x99 is the greek word for xe2x80x98footxe2x80x99 and it forms its plural the greek way therefore xe2x80x98octopodaxe2x80x99 not xe2x80x98octopixe2x80x99 never xe2x80x98octopixe2x80x99xe2x80x9d xe2x80x9cwell then octopoda your sonxe2x80x99s paper said octopusesxe2x80x9d xe2x80x9ci knowxe2x80x9d said step xe2x80x9cwhen he asked me the correct plural i told him octopoda but then he was still uncertain because my son doesnxe2x80x99t think he knows something until he knows it and so he looked it up and to my surprise octopoda is only used when referring to more than one species of octopus rather than when referring to more than one actual octopus what stevie put in his paper is in fact the preferred dictionary usage which you would have known too if you had looked it upxe2x80x9d  after proving his case that his son did indeed deserve an a grade he then threatened to bring the matter to the attention of the principal he then warned mrs jones that while he wanted the grade to remain unchanged he wanted her to inform the class that the ribbon would be awarded to stewie before revealing that he had been recording the conversation all along and after this after mrs jones came crying for forgiveness before leaving step realized how vulnerable she was and how she was channeling her frustration at one particular student in each class to find some relief from that according to the merriam webster dictionary 'octopi' 'octopuses' and 'octopodes' uk english are all correct plural versions of octopus supposedly randall would very much like the word 'octopi' to remain unrecognized by major dictionaries as otherwise it would lessen the magnitude of the climactic conclusion of this argument by rendering step's mockery of ms jones' perceived intellectual superiority factually invalid this also offers another reason apart from the pun why the octopus in the chart is named two mimic octopuses so randall can use the correct pluralization of the word in the comic this is an example of a comic where the title text seems more important to randall than the actual comic it should be noted that at least according to etymology dictonary octopi is wrong for exactly the reasons that step lists and first appears over 60 years later
