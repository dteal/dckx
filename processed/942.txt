n the joke here is that the how to juggle book assumes that there is gravity and momentum in the place where you are juggling it seems like there is no gravity or momentum because when cueball throws the juggling balls up in the air they don't come down and also don't continue the trajectory that they had when they left his hands or it could be that in the third panel it looks like he's juggling but the next ones show that they're just floating it could also be a joke on the fact that a comic of juggling looks just like a comic of hovering balls which would also explain the title text the title text draws on the fact the book being thrown into the trash can can also be interpreted as a hovering book while in a still image form such as shown in this comic while it is possible to reach zero gravity or at least microgravity there is no place in our universe where objects with mass have no momentum some possible explanations might be that cueball is outside of our universe he has just discovered something that's theoretically impossible or he is just dreaming or randall has taken comedic license on the momentum part for the sake of the joke  or he could be in a place where the surrounding fluid instead of having the normal properties of earth's atmosphere is a very thick or viscous fluid in which things simply become stuck also because cueball jumps and returns to the ground panels 6 &amp; 7 it would appear that the effect is limited to the balls and the book and does not extend to cueball himself  however his return could be caused by magnetism rather than gravity  in science fiction boots containing magnets are used to hold astronauts down when gravity is not adequate this comic is part of the following unpublished comic from the five minute comics five minute comics unpublished
