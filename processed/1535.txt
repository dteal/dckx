n the comic shows four similar euler diagrams one for each of the first four years of living with a pet the diagrams depict sets of words which have varying efficacy in actually identifying the pet and each one shows how the words used by randall to refer to his pet change year by year and becoming less and less specific as time goes on in the first year it is dominated by the actual name of the pet or words closely related for example a dog named lassie might be called either lassie dog collie or boy/girl moving on to the second year these related words like dog and collie get more abundant while the actual name is seldom used phrases such as good dog or here boy are likely common giving a dog the name dog is so common that there is a trope about that in the third year the pet's name is no longer used at all and the owner probably uses simple phrases like come or come here to call the pet omitting the name the fourth year entails the use of just any sound not coherent words this may be referring to something like baby talk or attempted mimicry of the pet's vocalizations this development can be attributed to the fact that some animals don't listen to their own name but rather react to the sound of the voice of their owner it could also refer to the growing bond between owner and the pet as well as the effect described in 231 cat proximity the title text suggests that the inevitable result of this continuing pattern is that by the seventh year randall will be communicating with the pet in its own language this might refer to the tendency of some pet owners to mimic or imitate their pets' vocalizations as if speaking to them alternatively this could be interpreted as a joke that pets don't have proper language and the owner has degenerated into lack on language his/herself as time goes on the title text and the caption makes it a little difficult to be certain if the comic refers to when you talk about your pet to other people my dog is always hungry or when you call at it which would be the only time it would make sense to use coherent words in the animals own language woof = come here
