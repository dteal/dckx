n there is an often repeated legend that according to the laws of aerodynamics bumblebees cannot fly no theories of aerodynamics or mechanics have ever claimed such a thing and the legend likely originates from a mathematical error that appeared in a 1934 book written by a scientist who acknowledged that the conclusion was probably wrong here randall puts a bumblebee on top of a control column inside of an airplane and let it fly the entire plane because the bumblebee now really can fly but physicists are still confused and don't know how the bees do accomplish this the strip also creates a fallacy that when experts can't explain something they must not be able to understand it in this particular case experts are unable to explain why bees can fly airplanes because they can't fly airplanes this strip could be a reference to bee movie in which the main character barry b benson enlists the help of other bees to land a plane with the last reserves of pollen on earth the opening quote of the movie repeats the bumblebee legend followed by saying the bee of course flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible the title text mentions that sociologists are also unable to explain why many people repeat this obviously wrong urban legend
