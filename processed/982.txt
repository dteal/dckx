n this comic is a pun on the phrase proof by intimidation which normally is a jocular term used mainly in mathematics it refers to a style of presenting a purported mathematical proof by giving an argument loaded with jargon and appeals to obscure results so that the audience is simply obliged to accept it lest they have to admit their ignorance and lack of understanding however in this comic proof by intimidation is taken to mean that by intimidating the elements within a set they will conform to the proof or as the title text says they will become well ordered this is accomplished by believing that the elements can be anthropomorphized such that they feel fear the idea of executing as an example was exemplified by sun tzu in the ancient book the art of war the axiom of choice which has been referenced in previously in 804 pumpkin carving says that given any collection of bins each containing at least one object it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin it was later referenced in the title text of 1724 proofs another comic about a math class with a similar theme on how teachers teach their student mathematical proofs in the title text the well ordering theorem states that every set can be well ordered a set x is well ordered by a strict total order if every non empty subset of x has a least element under the ordering this is also known as zermelo's theorem and is equivalent to the axiom of choice the woodchipper is a reference to the 1996 film fargo where a character uses one to dispose of a body there is another layer to the joke  if you can feed the set to the wood chipper that defines an ordering on the set the order in which the elements are fed to the wood chipper which would be well ordered  hey look the set really is well ordered  if there were no way of defining a well ordering on the set you wouldn't be able to feed it to the wood chipper
