n this comic is a take on the traditional appearance of a super hero when a disaster strikes in this case etymology man arrives who apparently has the power of etymology xe2x80x94 the study of the history of words their origins and how their form and meaning have changed over time as etymology man is explaining the history of the words tsunami and tidal wave the water starts rising around them as the waters continue to rise he continues to only explain the words rather than attempting to save them as a superhero should also the title text is a play on how useless aquaman is perceived to be compared to other superheroes as his powers xe2x80x94 breathing underwater speed swimming and communicating with sea life xe2x80x94 are very difficult for writers to make relevant indeed in the case of a flood aquaman and his aquatic allies would be able to assist with evacuations the irony of the situation comes from the fact that etymology man also has the power of flight and could in fact save cueball and ponytail if he was not so busy talking about the origin of the word tidal wave etymology man returns two comics later in 1012 wrong superhero
