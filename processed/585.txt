n scientific animal tracking is commonly used to learn more about other species particularly endangered ones as a way of better understanding their physiology behavior and what risks they face in the wild it's used in a wide variety of sciences including wildlife biology conservation wildlife management and zoology the scientists in this comic are working on a rather limited budget as ponytail explains and can't afford the cost of hiring someone to retrieve a tracking tag from the water so they create one that will pop free float to the surface and inflate a giant helium balloon causing it to gradually drift over land eventually the balloon will slowly deflate and soft land and with any luck someone will find it and mail it back to the scientists it goes horribly hilariously wrong the tag can't quite pop free from the shark and proceeds to inflate the balloon while the shark is still attached the shark rises right along with the tracker tag drifts back over land and goes right after the scientists that had been tracking it when science girl maybe in her first appearance before she got her buns sees the two scientists running frantically from a flying shark she figures that if such excitement is a daily part of a scientist's job that's the job for her as she tells her daddy cueball the title of the comic outreach refers to the type of activities that scientists do in order to motivate kids to become scientists when they grow up and it clearly worked for science girl who displays keen interest and great knowledge on many subjects in her next appearances the title text suggests keeping shark repellent by one's bed to account for the quite unlikely event of something like this happening because you never know it may be a reference to the adam west batman film where batman just happens to have some in his helicopter however since sharks are fish and fish cannot survive above water the shark would die if this happened in real life
