n four people are playing a role playing game megan is the game master gm describing the adventure and what happens the other people control imaginary characters in the game cueball attempts to have his character lead other characters in the imaginary construction of dice and gaming sheets this would allow his character to become the gm of a new game inside the game they're currently playing recursing refers to recursion a concept of computer programming where a piece of code calls itself essentially making the code run multiple times within itself looping is a rudimentary form of recursion it should be noted that the gm has multiple ways of dealing with this scene she could simply allude to the success or failure of the recursive game and skip to the next scene allow the roleplaying to continue with crafting checks determining the quality of the miniatures and a gambling check determining the outcome of the in universe rpg session have the party's plans be interrupted by some sort of threat  or megan could simply drop huge rocks on the partyt the title text refers to a pair of fictional rings anything passing through one gets teleported instantly to the other as if the two rings were next to each other there's an old gamer theory that if you drop one of the rings in the ocean water will naturally pass through it and out the other ring potentially draining the entire ocean or at least creating a perpetual seawater fountain out of the other ring and if you teleported one ring directly to the bottom of the ocean the amount of pressure pushing the water through would cause a gigantic never ending torrent obliterating anything placed in its path that idea is drawn out in 969 delta p a similar concept is addressed in what if 53 drain the oceans where a reader asked how quickly would the ocean's drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space was created at the bottom of challenger deep the deepest spot in the ocean how would the earth change as the water is being drained this question may have been inspired by the mention of throwing teleport rings into the ocean in this cartoon the rings themselves are most likely inspired by the ring gates item from the dungeons and dragons 35 dungeon master's guide the most recent edition of dungeons and dragons at the time this comic was published which had a similar function however a key thing to note is that the rings only allow 100 lbs of material to pass through them each day meaning that your geyser would only erupt every 24 hours though this may still qualify as an interesting result
