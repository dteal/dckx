n this comic is about how it's considered implausible to fly by positioning an umbrella over a water jet however with a powerful enough jet of water a strong enough umbrella and a sure grip such an event is physically plausible although you'd risk ripping your arm off the title text emphasize that cueball did reach a high altitude the only mystery here is a safe landing on the other hand if the umbrella is strong enough to haul him into the air then maybe it can be used as a parachute as well
