n by depicting how unimpressive the superhero superman would be if his increase in powers when compared to humans were the same as the moon's increase in apparent size during a supermoon randall points that the use of the term supermoon is an exaggeration this comic was posted one day after a supermoon an informal astronomical event where a full moon occurs when it is closest to earth causing the moon to appear 10% brighter and about 7% larger this is due to the apsidal precession of moon's elliptic orbit which has an orbital eccentricity of about 00549 the conditions for a supermoon happen once every 411&#160;days and the loose definition of the term means that the supermoon lasts for about two or three full moons returning to the not so superman the average american adult man is 69&#160;inches tall with a standard deviation of 29&#160;inches not so superman at an assumed 74&#160;inches 188&#160;cm tall is within the 94th percentile certainly a tall man but by no means phenomenal basketball players for sake of example range an upwards of 80&#160;inches 7% stronger most likely a reference to how the supermoon is 7% larger is a bit harder to quantify but it communicates not actually impressive to the reader all the same for example if an average man can lift 50&#160;kg the not so superman would lift 535&#160;kg the comic's title makes use of an asterisk that is being used as a wildcard when using search queries an asterisk represents one or more characters therefore superm*n can represent the strings superman and supermoon the title text refers  makes this same comparison with spider man spider man is capable of firing large amounts of webbing can cling to surfaces with superhuman gripping abilities and has a sixth sense spider sense that warns him about impending danger the title text describes trivially minimal versions of these powers analogous to the trivial size and brightness difference between a supermoon and a normal full moon supermoon is also referenced in panel 25 of 1052 every major's terrible and shortly thereafter in 1080 visual field in both cases displaying the same distaste for the formulation although not as clearly as here
