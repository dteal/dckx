n this chart is a visual representation of how worried people should be by various events in real life compared to the same events in movies based on the likelihood of the event causing serious harm in effect it's poking fun at various cliches and the emphasis on dramatic flair regardless of realism the chart's y axis indicates how worrying an event is in real life from not very worried to very worried while its x axis shows how worrying the event is in movies nine events are shown in the chart all of them cliches in the medium of film  spilling a drink on your shirt in both real life and in movies this just causes a stain and maybe a little embarrassment nosebleed nosebleeds are common in real life and almost never are seriousalmost nosebleeds in movies are almost always a sign that something is seriously wrong the common mundane nosebleeds almost never come up the comedy movie strange brew derives humor by treating a nosebleed with an appropriate amount of concern ie as a minor distraction in firefly the blue hand men use a device that causes a nosebleed followed by  massive haemorrhaging and death even mundane nosebleeds brought on by fisticuffs are a sign that either someone has just lost or someone is about to have an adrenaline rush this does not always apply to boxing movies where the hero can easily have a massive nosebleed and still win the fight breaking news people in real life commonly don't pay much attention to the news at all so many breaking stories go unnoticed until much later  most breaking news stories are also about non threatening events eg presidential addresses or events that are far removed from the viewer however in movies seeing the news station switch to a breaking news broadcast is usually a means to introduce a significant plot element that the characters find worrying and large numbers of people are often shown watching and being emotionally affected by the news while it's breaking xkcd has referenced news reports as foreshadowing before parking ticket tickets in movies are almost always ignored but in real life they are moderately worrying because they cost money and can tarnish your driving record persistent cough in real life coughing fits can be a sign of serious illness but usually aren't if you have a persistent cough you should check with a doctor in movies just like with nosebleeds a person with a persistent cough is almost always extremely ill or infectious we need to talk this phrase is a common stereotypical lead in to a serious conversation usually about a couple's relationship status that often causes a high level of worry in the recipient  according to this chart this phrase is equally worrisome both in movies and in real life getting knocked out by a punch in movies a character who is knocked out by a punch always wakes up sometime later with no lasting effects making it less cause for concern than a spilt drink in real life however a person knocked out by a punch can suffer serious brain injuries or even die from the punch itself or can sustain further injuries from their head hitting the ground chest wounds the chart mentions wounds on both your right and left sides in real life a chest wound to either side is extremely worrying but in movies getting wounded on the right side of the chest will rarely deal lasting damage to the hero or primary villain to show how badass they are wounds on the left side of the chest signify swift death this can be explained by the common misconception that the heart is on the left side of the chest it is actually in the centre with a slight tendency to the left however even left side chest wounds are apparently still less worrisome than nosebleeds it must also be noted that the term chest wound is more broad than what the author of the comic appears to mean more narrow terms of thoracic gunshot wound gunshot chest wound thoracic ballistic trauma or penetrating chest wound the latter is slightly broader and includes the damage inflicted by blades and other impaled objects would be more appropriate because just a chest wound includes such insignificant events as minor skin cuts in the chest area  the title text expands on the aforementioned breaking news reports while already overly worrying whenever they occur in movies compared to real life should the movie's news report cover an event at a hospital usually an outbreak of some major disease or a laboratory a monster escaping a toxic gas released an explosion etc these events are universally much more worrisome than any other type of news story since they are guaranteed to be important for the protagonists in short order
