n this comic is a typical xkcd compilation relationships math graphs and of course the twist at 523 decline cueball's fascination with graphs seems to have retaliated against him cueball wants to get back together with megan but she declines and shows him a graph showing why she thinks that the downward trend of the graph will convince him that their relationship is also in decline but cueball takes that as this is a girl who does not follow proper protocol since she does not label the axes plural for axis on her graph we do not even know the unit of measure on the graph let alone what each axis corresponds to for all we know the horizontal axis could be labeled time and the vertical axis could be labeled crappiness of relationship or unawesomeness of relationship in that case a downward trend would be a positive thing in the twist cueball sees that he can do better than this girl and switches his position and decides he is going to break up with her the title text points out the irony that if the axes had been labelled then cueball would be able to use it to determine exactly how much better a relationship he could get since he could read how crappy the present one is yet he would lose the twist at the end so that the graph data would have to convince him and not the lack of labels
