n beret guy's business as previously seen in 1032 networking and 1293 job interview is going well although it is unclear why the common theme in these three comics is that beret guy misuses common business cliches the following are examples and phrases that randall is likely making a joke about  if you're reading this the webserver was installed correctly when a web server is installed automatically like apache through a package manager it typically comes with a minimal configuration meant to deliver a single page saying all is working fine usually a company will then configure the web server to provide actual meaningful content it appears that in this case beret guy's company kept the page as is but also trademarked the sentence as the company's motto and proudly displays it under the company logo  companynamewebsite companies are usually given descriptive or evocative names; beret guy's company meanwhile has been given a generic placeholder name that explains nothing about the company or website except that it is a company with a website in 2015 almost every middle sized company runs a website so it doesn't mean beret guy's company is in the information technology business but many elements are specifically parodying google  welcome to a meeting the usual way to start a meeting is to welcome the participants by telling them in which meeting they are eg welcome to the meeting on here the complete lack of specifics in this sentence is an indication that the meeting has in fact no purpose at all except to be just a meeting it could also mean that beret guy does not know the proper way to welcome people to a meeting  i'm almost out of words so i'll keep this short a common theme in the busy world of business is lack of time so i'm almost out of time would be a valid reason for keeping a meeting short rather than a finite quantity of words aside from the fiction movie a thousand words or people taking a vow of silence people usually don't have a particular quota on the number of words they have or can use beret guy also seems to run out of words in the title text of 1560 bubblegum  just wanna touch bases often business professions will contact a customer to touch base meaning to check in for a status update the use of the plural bases suggests beret guy does not know what this means this could also be a word play on the expression cover some bases  self driving car project google has been working on self driving cars which usually shouldn't be lost track of and found by the police the fact that it was launched by accident is concerning it could mean the car was turned on by mistake and then left unattended or perhaps that a driver of one of their cars fell asleep or otherwise stopped controlling the vehicle but it is not clear because the accidental launch may refer to the project itself rather than the car the involvement of the police implies that the car crashed or otherwise obstructed traffic that said 90 miles before crash is a good result for a self driving car especially when you didn't even know you built a self driving car what's especially ironic is the implication that the employees were carpooling sharing a single vehicle for their commute for reasons of efficiency/economy in the self driving car and yet this carpool activity ended with the car setting off with nobody in it at all these types of car was the topic of the later comic 1559 driving maybe misusing one of beret guy's cars self driving cars is a recurring topic on xkcd  sales any luck figuring out who our customers are in the real world when companies want to find out who their customers are they are talking about learning more about their existing customers in order to more closely match these customers' needs and to discover ways to attract more of them here beret guy and ponytail apparently use the phrase literally they have no records of making any sales in a normal enterprise money doesn't usually appear from nowhere&#91;citation needed&#93; and most businesses would be very unsettled if their cash flow was from an unknown source additionally the company would not be able to comply with government regulations that require it to report information regarding its income for tax purposes in addition to being fined for failure to properly report its income the company would be investigated as a suspected money laundering enterprise  cool red beetle in the hallway beret guy might be referring to seeing an insect but given his continually surreal world he might have instead seen a red volkswagen beetle meaning there is an actual car in the hallway this also matches with the self driving car project potentially explaining why the car is inside the building randall's all caps lettering hides the beetle versus beetle distinction  bug tracker usually refers to systems for tracking discovery analysis and fixing of software bugs errors and problems not the location of physical objects be they insects or volkswagen beetles which are nicknamed bugs  web facing title text usually refers to software or a server that is connected to the internet using a web interface however in this case the term is applied to chairs placed in front of a computer with internet browsing capability  white papers title text are usually policy recommendations but here beret guy is likely talking about actual near worthless blank white pieces of paper  main strengths title text typically refer to one's skills but we physically cannot die refers to the fact that incorporated companies are in a sense anthropomorphised xe2x80x94 they're legally treated as persons with the ability to sue and be sued in civil courts or that beret guy and his employees are literally immortal in which case that would indeed be a great asset which could be used in a variety of ways from things like making an unstoppable army though they could still be captured or incapacitated to investing for a long long time on that note if beret guy is immortal perhaps many many years ago before his mind got wonky he might have invested a lot of money and is finally noticing the large amount of interest that has accrued this would partly explain why there is lots of money coming in without any customers
