n a diode is an electronic component that to put it simply blocks current traveling in one direction but allows current going the other way diodes are a common component of digital circuits such as those found in a computer the end that rejects incoming current is marked with a line or band of paint the comic is describing a common frustration in relationships sometimes one party in a relationship will feel that the other isn't listening to them even though they themselves are being as open as possible this is analogous to the function of a diode which the comic indicates by literally introducing a diode into the dialogue the diode introduced has the banded end being held by cueball this means his negative energy is blocked by the diode while megan's flows through to him this means she never receives his emotional pain so does not feel she did anything wrong  the title text simply further illustrates the point megan didn't perceive cueball's apology due to it being blocked by the diode so she berates cueball for not apologizing
