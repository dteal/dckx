n megan's car appears to have combusted at some point while she left it unattended suspecting her friends and acquaintances cueball black hat and danish of perhaps having something to do with it she gathers them in front of a couch and draws attention to the fact that something is just a little bit wrong with the two juxtaposed images she shows them when she asks what is wrong with this picture they all three take this question literally and start critiquing the picture quality and not the subject feigning complete ignorance about the car being on fire when megan exasperatedly tells them what is wrong with the picture xe2x80x94that her car is on firexe2x80x94 they continue to act evasive by telling her that she should buy a better camera but at least here they acknowledges that the car is on fire as they suggest she uses the insurance money from the car to buy this better camera the title text and the dialogue suggest that megan's friends aren't being evasive to avoid telling her the truth they are just doing exactly what they were told they patiently and correctly describe what is wrong with the picture if megan had wanted to know what was wrong with her car then she should have asked that directly her friends are just being friendly when they offer to help her create the scene again so that she can shoot the picture correctly and the again proves that they did set the car on fire and they are not trying to deny this but for sure they are messing with her both by setting her car on fire deliberately understanding her question in another way than she intended and then even suggesting that they will set her new car on fire as well as for the particular details of the digital photography terms mentioned  white balance artificial indoor light is more yellow outdoor light is more blue the light color can also depend on weather or time of day the human eye is a very good judge of whiteness under a variety of lighting conditions digital cameras often have difficulty automatically correcting for this which can cause images to look too blue or orange professional cameras and image editing software allow you to adjust the white balance manually which megan probably has not done focus is a bit too close as light passes through a camera lens it is bent until the rays converge on the film or sensor if the focus is too close it implies that point of convergence from the light of the subject is slightly in front of the sensor ie that megan has accidentally focused on something closer than the car this will result in near objects being too sharp and the car being slightly blurry chromatic aberration this causes colored artifacts in an image typically caused by cheap lenses which do not focus light of different wavelengths and thus different colors in the same way it is usually visible as a blueish or reddish outline around objects megapixels this is the number of image sensor elements of digital cameras or the pixels on digital displays more pixels improve the resolution but can also result in less overall quality for the pictures due in part to the reduced size of each pixel sensor because the total sensor size is typically the same for a given class of camera and because for consumer targeted products the total engineering budget is limited so that extra money spent on a high megapixel sensor ends up reducing the money spent on other elements such as the lenses  while this comic focuses on misunderstandings by people viewing pictures this could be also a reference to the battery fire in a stored damaged chevrolet volt automobile during a side impact safety test which the car passed with a five star rating at popular mechanics its high voltage battery pack was damaged part of the test procedure includes rolling the vehicle over after the impact to check for leaking fluids; during the rollover check the vehicle electronics were flooded with coolant the damaged vehicle was then put into storage where its high voltage battery remained energized; three weeks later the battery spontaneously caught fire potentially due to corrosion and destroyed the car gm subsequently made design changes to address the causes of the fire megan's car also caught fire in 1693 oxidation but this time she knew for sure who did it so no direct relation to this comic except the poor luck megan has with her cars
