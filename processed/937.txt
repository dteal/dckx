n this is a comic with a take on an application store the most common app stores are for iphones and android devices app stores take all the reviews and average the ratings for the overall star rating in this comic we see why this is sometimes a bad idea in this case there are three 5 star reviews about the stability and user interface features of the app left by users who actually never experienced its core functionality simply because they never had a tornado since they got it; however the only review related to whether the app really works is given the same weight as the others also see future comic 1098 star ratings the title text is a note from the developer's bug report which said they could not reproduce the error of course they could only reproduce such a failure if there were a tornado coming towards their area this is a fairly rare situation especially in certain areas of the world this lack of suitable testing conditions explains why the actual tornado prediction portion of their code appears to be faulty the title text could also be a joke that is it is saying that reviewer 4 was possibly killed by the tornado and thus that reviewer was unable to give any more feedback alternatively it could be a reference to 583 cnr
