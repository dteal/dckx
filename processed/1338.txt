n this comic shows the total weight of mankind and all other land mammals only a few centuries ago humans their pets and livestock came to make up a great proportion of the earth's land mammal biomass note that only land dwelling mammals are taken into account so for instance whales and sea cows will not be included whether this only covers animals that cannot live on land or any marine mammals like for instance seals and walrus is not clear the design of the blocks loosely resembles a cell this could be a reference to how these animals support humans analogous to a cell supporting a central nucleus if so it seems that all the animals in this diagram wild or domestic in some way support human activity the title text states that bacteria outweigh us thousands to one without counting the several pounds of bacteria in our body that are considered part of our own weight like gut flora the aforementioned cell could also be a bacterium making it a possible reference to the title text since 1256 blocks have been used to sketch the cell and bacteria outweigh us by about this factor this comic may be a nerd snipe from randall challenging his readers to figure out the missing parts randall also discusses animal biomass in fairy demographics in which he compares the biomass of fairies to humans horses and humpback whales
