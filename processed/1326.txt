n this comic is a joke about the use of sharks in action movies in these movies sharks are often used to guard locations and dispense capital punishment1 since the idea of a guard shark is not practical this comic suggests that villains raise sharks to help with declining shark populations in the oceans in this comic cueball is an evil villain who rules over a doom island in addition to commanding minions and detaining prisoners he keeps sharks to threaten prisoners when a prisoner escapes the island he orders his minions to release the sharks however the sharks do not hunt the prisoner but merely swim away the comic jokes that cueball is using fugitives as a pretense to help with declining shark populations and that doom island is just a front for a marine biology center cueball maintains the whole guard sharks idea as a cover up so that his minions do not catch on to the real mission the title text plays on the idea that cueball can't be openly concerned with his sharks' welfare without his minions catching on he claims to be inspecting the shark cages as a shark cage is normally used to provide protection for divers wishing to observe sharks up close they would not work well as cages to hold prisoners which is their stated purpose the comic implies that when he is inspecting the cages he is really performing a scientific study on the sharks or simply observing them because he loves them because a real villainous lair would have no use for shark cages it follows that cueball owns them solely for the purpose of gratifying his interest in his sharks thus forcing him to keep up the pretense of the cages being of some help in preventing prisoners from escaping the shark issue is also one of the items on the chart of 1331 frequency
