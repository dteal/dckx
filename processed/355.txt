n it's hard to know when you are in a relationship in modern times in olden days you might fancy a girl and then ask her father if you might court her and if he granted his permission you would be a couple today that kind of structure and formality is terrifyingly antiquated; as a result we don't have any of the straightforward cues this comic suggests that making it facebook official which means asserting the existence of a romantic relationship on facebook by setting one's status to in a relationship has recently become a way to define when you are a couple cueball would like to do it probably after having sex for the first time with his love interest to get confidence in his relationship and/or show it off to his friends because his love interest isn't so sure about that relationship or doesn't like to formalize it and prefers to enjoy without thinking too much about it he suggests a compromise using the it's complicated status instead and he does so with a phrasing very reminiscent of a formal way to propose to marry someone will you be my wife the title text takes it a step further suggesting that facebook has become the only reliable way to know about relationships xe2x80x94 even so without access to facebook relationships can't evolve
