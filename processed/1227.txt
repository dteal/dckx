n the debate as to whether or not the pace of modern life is detrimental to society culture and the human experience in general has been going on for longer than we may realize presently the debate has focused on technology such as smartphones tablets and other portable electronics; however many of the same arguments were made against newspapers magazines telegraphs telephones and even written correspondence 100 years ago people often tend to think of older times as better the people complaining compare their present time to the time they lived in before that is a couple of decades ago and this has been happening for over a century at least this comic makes a point that the older times people refer to were also criticized in exactly the same fashion since the same criticism is applied to each generation by the generation before that one every generation thinks that the one they were born in is the good one this is presentism as explained by randall in 24 godel escher kurt halsey  the comic begins and ends with very similar arguments perhaps emphasizing how these debates cycle and repeat over time the comic does not directly state whether these opinions and criticisms were justified or simple fallacies there is a desire to consider our present existence as good and reasonable and that society has been improving over time the difficulty lies in considering the possibility that each generation was perhaps correct in their criticism on reading all of these quotes one may find these quotes redundant and tiresome to read  readers may find themselves skimming the text and skipping several quotes once they get the overall idea  this could be a self referential point demonstrating that the writing style of older times was less convenient than the oft criticized brief modern style some parts of all that long texts are in bold others not here is the summary for only this bold text picturing just our modern world  the art of letter writing is fast dying out we fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper in olden times it was different men now live think and work at express speed sulkily read as they travel leaving them no time to talk with the friend who may share the compartment with them the age of leisure is dead and the art of conversation is dying a craving for literary nips there never was an age in which so many people were able to write badly the art of pure line engraving is dying out we live at too fast a rate nothing is left to the imagination and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that have been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary thirty pages is now too much fifteen pages further condensed a summary of the summary those who are dipping into so many subjects and gathering information in a summary and superficial form lose the habit of settling down to great works hurried reading can never be good reading mental and nervous degeneration among a growing class of people a brain incapable of normal working in a large measure due to the hurry and excitement of modern life almost instantaneous communication between remote points of the globe teach the children how to play instead of shutting them in badly ventilated schoolrooms increased demand made by the conditions of modern life upon the brain we talk across a continent telegraph across an ocean we take even our pleasures sadly and make a task of our play the managers of sensational newspapers create perverted tastes and develop vicious tendencies to take sufficient time for our meals seems frequently impossible may i be permitted to say a word in favour of a very worthy and valuable old friend of mine mr long walk i am afraid that this good gentleman is in danger of getting neglected if not forgotten people talk as they ride bicyclesxe2x80x93at a rushxe2x80x93without pausing to consider their surroundings the profession of letters is so little understood tendency among the children of today to rebel against restraint our modern family gathering silent each individual with his head buried in his favourite magazine deal openly with situations which no person would have dared to mention in general society forty years ago a hundred years ago it took so long and cost so much to send a letter that it seemed worth while to put some time and thought into writing it a brief letter to day may be followed by another next weekxe2x80x93a line now by another to morrow  the style of the comic is very similar to that of 1311 2014 which was released a year and a half earlier the title text shows that the meaning of the institute of marriage debate has likewise been going on for quite some time
