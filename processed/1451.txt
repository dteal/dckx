n plot and characters are generally the parts a movie that most people presumably pay attention to as the plot the story and its purpose and the characters the emotional connection and character development are generally the things most people find enjoyable about particular films cueball however pays particular attention to what's on the computer screens shown briefly in the background generally speaking these screens are shown to the audience for a short period of time and at a low level of detail just to dress a set and make a scene feel more realistic or high tech they may contain endless columns of gibberish or miscellaneous data flashing by in an eye blink only visible by freeze framing or cross hairs zipping across maps often the contents of the computer screens are so unimportant or hard to read that the filmmakers do not bother to spend much time if any at all ensuring that what is shown on the screen is accurate or even relevant to the film they may be designed by artists not fully aware of the details of the plot and as a result their content where it is intelligible such as in a map can have little to no connection to the dialog or other story events going on in front of them they sometimes even contain jokes it is rare if ever that important information would be communicated to the viewer through background computer screens hence cueball's spending most of his time watching the screens seems counter intuitive to understanding and enjoying the film greenland a large island east of canada is 80% covered in ice up to several kilometers in depth and has a population of fewer than 100000 people depending on the aliens' priorities and the plot of the movie there are myriad reasons both for and against wanting to land in such a remote area in the title text cueball suggests investigating how a list of coordinates from another background screen relates to the location of the alien craft in greenland suggesting that cueball thinks the filmmakers may have intended the viewers to record the information early in the film and analyze the data to learn relevant plot information something that is very unlikely and in the rare instance it is true is intended to be superfluous most of the time filmmakers take efforts to ensure the audience can easily follow plot points by making them more obvious than they might be in reality
