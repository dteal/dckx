n xkcd is a webcomic of romance sarcasm math and language; humor isn't necessarily guaranteed this comic is an example of that it being severely depressing the comic is built around a dialogue between two people we'll say cueball is the one talking and the other is his friend about cancer presumably cancer that megan has been diagnosed with the conversation itself is about as straightforward as a conversation can be it details the maturation of cueball's and megan's understanding of cancer diagnoses knowledge which we can presume he has gained reluctantly by watching a loved one suffer this whole cancer series was sparked because randall's then fiancee now wife is currently in megan's position and we the readers are now the beneficiaries of this new understanding of cancer diagnoses without having to watch somebody close to us suffer the comic's title lanes comes from the two panels which illustrate both ends of the spectrum of cueball's mental representation of how cancer treatment proceeds in that there are many possible outcomes for cancer treatment the image of a multi lane freeway seems an apt metaphor to represent this understanding visually in the first freeway diagram there are several paths but the system is very simple and easy to take in only a few lanes lead off into the oblivion which surrounds the freeway a single off ramp circles back from the path to survival to treatment and survival is a visible endpoint in the second freeway diagram however things are much much more complex and much more bleak even six years out survival isn't visible and many lanes end in oblivion sometimes not veering off for years after treatment the title text informs us that this is meant to be loosely representative of breast cancer stages one through four proceeding by quarters from left to right it's a grim outlook hence the friend's understated but completely fitting reaction to this plethora of new knowledge specific numbers  there are 52 lanes so 13 lanes per cancer stage  stage one has a 113 =~8% chance of recurrence leading to death within 6 years  stage 2 has a 513=~38% chance  stage 3 has a 713=~54% chance  stage 4 has an 1113=~85% chance of death within 6 years    given randall's concern these numbers are probably pretty accurate go get a mammogram fuck cancer
