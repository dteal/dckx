n geoguessr is a game in which the player is given a location in google street view and asked to guess precisely where in the world they are by clicking on a map of the world based only on the 360 degree view in the street view display cueball is upset because he keeps making his guesses based on landmarks and his guesses end up being wrong because the landmark he based his guess off of was actually a replica of the real one of course from a statistical perspective this makes sense for every famous object there are countless replicas; however most people will be familiar with the specific location of the original object; and the vast majority of famous objects except a few notable works of art exist in only one place in the world take the statue of liberty for instance  though the original is based in new york city it has hundreds of replicas all over the planet however as the title text alludes to you're far more likely to find a dirt road than to find anything recognizable since google street view maps roads more than anything else hence its name becoming a connoisseur of such a mundane thing is a reference to 915 connoisseur anyone who's ever played with geoguessr knows also that seemingly helpful clues can sometimes be useless for instance if you recognize russian words on a sign the nation of russia actually encompasses an enormous area so unless you can recognize a specific region there's no obvious place to guess where you can hope to get high points unlike somewhere like england where guessing london is guaranteed to put you within reasonable distance from a global perspective legoland is a good example of this if you can't tell if you're in denmark or california it's not like you can just guess halfway between and do well
